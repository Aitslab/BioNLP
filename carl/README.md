# Natural Language Processing for CovidQ project

## Project outline

This project was created as part of the CovidQ project with the purpose of providing proof of concept and strategy development. The main purpouse is developing extraction of symptoms and findings from Swedish clinical charts using a BioBERT model.

The goal is to train a BioBERT model to extract symptoms and findings from freetext in patient records.

*The project is done as part of semester five of the medical program at the University of Lund*
