# Introduction
This README describes the codebase I developed for the following sub-projects:
* [Hyperparameter Tuning of BioGPT](https://github.com/Aitslab/BioNLP/tree/master/jacob/BioGPT)
* [Free-form Text Relation Extraction with BioGPT](https://github.com/Aitslab/BioNLP/tree/master/jacob/BioGPT)
* [SciBERT Finetuning with Combined ChemProt and Drugprot Corpora](https://github.com/Aitslab/BioNLP/tree/master/jacob/SciBERT_Finetune), a continuation of a previous student's work found [here](https://github.com/Aitslab/BioNLP/tree/master/nils)

These bullets are hyperlinks to the sub-project specifc READMEs with 
documentation on setup, files, usage, and saved results.

A detailed logbook can be found here: [`Jacob_Krucinski_EDAN70_Log.ipynb`](Jacob_Krucinski_EDAN70_Log.ipynb) and final report can be found [here](EDAN70_Project_Report_JacobK.pdf)


# Setup
The best way to run these Python scripts is to set up a virtual enviroment 
using Anaconda or Miniconda. The basics are available on this
[page](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html).
