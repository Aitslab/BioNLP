The relation between cyclosporine and depression is complex and may be influenced by several factors, including the dose of cyclosporine, the duration of cyclosporine therapy, and the presence of concomitant medications, such as lithium, which may affect the pharmacokinetics of cyclosporine and the development of cyclosporine-induced depression. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) Cyclosporine-induced depression is a serious and potentially life-threatening side effect of cyclosporine therapy, and it is important to identify patients at risk for the development of cyclosporine-induced depression so that appropriate interventions can be instituted.
