The purpose of the study is to explore the function of P2X3 and NK1 receptors antagonists on cyclophosphamide (D003520) (CYP)-induced (D003520) cystitis (D003556) in rats. METHODS: Sixty female Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into three groups. The rats in the control group were intraperitoneally (i.p.) injected with 0.9% saline (4 ml/kg); the rats in the model group were i.p. injected with CYP (D003520) (150 mg/kg); and the rats in the intervention group were i.p. injected with CYP (D003520) with subsequently perfusion of bladder with P2X3 and NK1 receptors' antagonists, Suramin (D013498) and GR 82334. Spontaneous pain (D010146) behaviors following the administration of CYP (D003520) were observed. Urodynamic parameters, bladder pressure-volume curve, maximum voiding pressure (MVP), and maximum cystometric capacity (MCC), were recorded. Pathological changes in bladder tissue were observed. Immunofluorescence was used to detect the expression of P2X3 and NK1 receptors in bladder. MCC in the model group was lower than the control and intervention groups (P < 0.01). Histological changes evident in model and intervention groups rats' bladder included edema (D004487), vasodilation, and infiltration of inflammatory cells.
