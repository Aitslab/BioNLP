naloxone reverses the antihypertensive effect of clon@@ idine@@ . in un@@ anesthetized , spontaneously hypertensive rats the decrease in blood pressure and heart rate produced by intravenous clonidine , 5 to 20 micrograms / kg , was inhibited or reversed by nal@@ ozone , 0.2 to 2 mg / k@@ g. the hypotensive effect of 100 mg / kg alpha @-@ methyl@@ dopa was also partially reversed by nal@@ ox@@ on@@ e. naloxone alone did not affect either blood pressure or heart rat@@ e. in brain membranes from spontaneously hypertensive rats clonidine , 10 ( -8 ) to 10 ( -5 ) m , did not influence stereoselective binding of &#91; 3@@ h &#93; -@@ naloxone ( 8 nm ) , and naloxone , 10 ( -8 ) to 10 ( -4 ) m , did not influence clonidine @-@ sup@@ pres@@ sible binding of &#91; 3@@ h &#93; -@@ dihydro@@ erg@@ oc@@ ryp@@ tine ( 1 nm ) . these findings indicate that in spontaneously hypertensive rats the effects of central alpha @-@ adrenoceptor stimulation involve activation of opiate recep@@ tor@@ s. as naloxone and clonidine do not appear to interact with the same receptor site , the observed functional antagonism suggests the release of an endogenous opiate by clonidine or alpha @-@ methyl@@ dopa and the possible role of the opiate in the central control of sympathetic tone .
lidocaine @-@ induced cardiac as@@ yst@@ ol@@ e. intravenous administration of a single 50 @-@ mg bolus of lidocaine in a 67 @-@ year @-@ old man resulted in profound depression of the activity of the sin@@ oatrial and atrioventricular nodal pac@@ em@@ ak@@ er@@ s. the patient had no apparent associated conditions which might have predisposed him to the development of brady@@ arrhythmias ; and , thus , this probably represented a true idi@@ osyn@@ cr@@ asy to lidocaine .
su@@ x@@ am@@ ethonium infusion rate and observed fascicul@@ ation@@ s. a dose @-@ response stud@@ y@@ . su@@ x@@ am@@ ethonium chloride ( sch ) was administered i.v. to 36 adult males at six rates : 0.25 mg s @-@ 1 to 20 mg s @-@ 1@@ . the infusion was discontinued either when there was no muscular response to tetanic stimulation of the ulnar nerve or when sch 120 mg was exce@@ ede@@ d. six additional patients received a 30 @-@ mg i.v. bolus dos@@ e. fascicul@@ ations in six areas of the body were scored from 0 to 3 and sum@@ mated as a total fasc@@ ic@@ ulation sco@@ re@@ . the times to first fasc@@ ic@@ ulation , twitch suppression and tetanus suppression were inversely related to the infusion rat@@ es@@ . fascicul@@ ations in the six areas and the total fasc@@ ic@@ ulation score were related directly to the rate of infu@@ sion@@ . total fasc@@ ic@@ ulation scores in the 30 @-@ mg bolus group and the 5 @-@ mg s @-@ 1 and 20 @-@ mg s @-@ 1 infusion groups were not significantly different .
gal@@ anth@@ amine hydro@@ bromide , a longer acting anti@@ cholinesterase drug , in the treatment of the central effects of scopolamine ( hy@@ osc@@ ine ) . gal@@ anth@@ amine hydro@@ bromide , an anti@@ cholinesterase drug capable of penetrating the blood @-@ brain barrier , was used in a patient demonstrating central effects of scopolamine ( hy@@ osc@@ ine ) over@@ dos@@ ag@@ e. it is longer acting than physostigmine and is used in anaesthesia to reverse the non @-@ depolarizing neuromuscular bloc@@ k@@ . however , studies into the dose necessary to comb@@ ating scopolamine intoxication are indicated .
effects of un@@ in@@ eph@@ rectomy and high protein feeding on lithium @-@ induced chronic renal failure in rat@@ s. rats with lithium @-@ induced nephropathy were subjected to high protein ( h@@ p ) feeding , un@@ in@@ eph@@ rectomy ( n@@ x ) or a combination of these , in an attempt to induce glomerular hyper@@ filtration and further progression of renal fail@@ ure@@ . newborn female w@@ istar rats were fed a lithium @-@ containing diet ( 50 mmol / kg ) for 8 weeks and then randomized to normal diet , h@@ p diet ( 40 vs. 19 % ) , n@@ x or h@@ p + n@@ x for another 8 week@@ s. corresponding non @-@ lithium pretreated groups were gener@@ ated@@ . when comparing all lithium treated versus non @-@ lithium @-@ treated groups , lithium caused a reduction in glomerular filtration rate ( g@@ fr ) without significant changes in effective renal plasma flow ( as determined by a marker secreted into the proximal tubules ) or lithium cl@@ ear@@ anc@@ e. consequently , lithium pretreatment caused a fall in filtration fraction and an increase in fractional li excre@@ tion@@ . lithium also caused proteinuria and systolic hypertension in absence of glomerul@@ os@@ cler@@ osi@@ s. h@@ p failed to accent@@ u@@ ante progression of renal failure and in fact tended to increase g@@ fr and decrease plasma creatinine levels in lithium pretreated rat@@ s. n@@ x caused an additive deterioration in g@@ fr which , however , was ameliorated by h@@ p. n@@ x + h@@ p caused a further rise in blood pressure in li @-@ pretreated rat@@ s. the results indicate that li @-@ induced nephropathy , even when the g@@ fr is only modestly reduced , is associated with proteinuria and arterial systolic hyper@@ ten@@ sion@@ . in this model of chronic renal failure the decline in g@@ fr is not accompanied by a corresponding fall in effective renal plasma flow , which may be the functional expression of the formation of non@@ filtr@@ ating at@@ ubular glomerul@@ i. the fractional reabsorption of tubular fluid by the proximal tubules is reduced , leaving the distal delivery unchanged .

treatment of cro@@ hn &apos;s disease with fusi@@ dic acid : an antibiotic with immunosuppressive properties similar to cyclospor@@ in@@ . fusi@@ dic acid is an antibiotic with t @-@ cell specific immunosuppressive effects similar to those of cyclospor@@ in@@ . because of the need for the development of new treatments for cro@@ hn &apos;s disease , a pilot study was undertaken to estimate the pharmacodynamics and tolerability of fusi@@ dic acid treatment in chronic active , therapy @-@ resistant patient@@ s. eight cro@@ hn &apos;s disease patients were in@@ clu@@ de@@ d. fusi@@ dic acid was administered orally in a dose of 500 mg t.@@ d.@@ s. and the treatment was planned to last 8 week@@ s. the disease activity was primarily measured by a modified individual grading sco@@ re@@ . five of 8 patients ( 63 % ) improved during fusi@@ dic acid treatment : 3 at two weeks and 2 after four week@@ s. there were no serious clinical side effects , but dose reduction was required in two patients because of na@@ use@@ a. biochemically , an increase in alkaline phosphatases was noted in 5 of 8 cases ( 63 % ) , and the greatest increases were seen in those who had elevated levels prior to treat@@ ment@@ . all reversed to pre @-@ treatment levels after cessation of treat@@ ment@@ . the results of this pilot study suggest that fusi@@ dic acid may be of benefit in selected chronic active cro@@ hn &apos;s disease patients in whom conventional treatment is in@@ effec@@ ti@@ ve@@ . because there seems to exist a scientific rationale for the use of fusi@@ dic acid at the cytokine level in inflammatory bowel disease , we suggest that the role of this treatment should be further investigated .
electrocardiographic evidence of myocardial injury in psychi@@ atr@@ ically hospitalized cocaine ab@@ us@@ er@@ s. the electrocardiograms ( ec@@ g ) of 99 cocaine @-@ ab@@ using patients were compared with the ec@@ gs of 50 schizophrenic contro@@ l@@ s. eleven of the cocaine abusers and none of the controls had ec@@ g evidence of significant myocardial injury defined as myocardial infarction , ischemia , and bundle branch block .
sulpiride @-@ induced tardive dyst@@ oni@@ a. sulpiride is a selective d2 @-@ receptor antagonist with antipsychotic and antidepressant proper@@ ti@@ es@@ . although initially thought to be free of extrapyramidal side effects , sulpiride @-@ induced tardive dyskinesia and parkinsonism have been reported occa@@ sion@@ all@@ y@@ . we studied a 37 @-@ year @-@ old man who developed persistent segmental dystonia within 2 months after starting sulpiride therap@@ y@@ . we could not find any previous reports of sulpiride @-@ induced tardive dystonia .
ocular and auditory toxicity in hemodi@@ alyzed patients receiving des@@ ferri@@ ox@@ amin@@ e. during an 18 @-@ month period of study 41 hemodi@@ alyzed patients receiving des@@ ferri@@ oxamine ( 10 @-@ 40 mg / kg bw / 3 times weekly ) for the first time were monitored for detection of audi@@ o@@ visual toxicity . 6 patients presented clinical symptoms of visual or auditory toxic@@ it@@ y@@ . moreover , detailed ophthalmologic and audi@@ ologic studies disclosed abnormalities in 7 more asymptomatic patient@@ s. visual toxicity was of retinal origin and was characterized by a tr@@ itan @-@ type dys@@ chromat@@ opsy , sometimes associated with a loss of visual acuity and pig@@ mentary retinal depos@@ it@@ s. auditory toxicity was characterized by a mid@@ - to high @-@ frequency neuro@@ sens@@ orial hearing loss and the lesion was of the cochlear typ@@ e. des@@ ferri@@ oxamine withdrawal resulted in a complete recovery of visual function in 1 patient and partial recovery in 3 , and a complete reversal of hearing loss in 3 patients and partial recovery in 3. this toxicity appeared in patients receiving the higher doses of des@@ ferri@@ oxamine or coincided with the normalization of ferritin or aluminium serum lev@@ el@@ s. the data indicate that audi@@ o@@ visual toxicity is not an infrequent complication in hemodi@@ alyzed patients receiving des@@ ferri@@ ox@@ amin@@ e. peri@@ odical audi@@ o@@ visual monitoring should be performed on hemodi@@ alyzed patients receiving the drug in order to detect adverse effects as early as possible .
myasthenia gravis presenting as weakness after magnesium administr@@ ation@@ . we studied a patient with no prior history of neuromuscular disease who became virtually quadri@@ plegic after parenteral magnesium administration for pre@@ eclamp@@ si@@ a. the serum magnesium concentration was 3.0 me@@ q / l , which is usually well toler@@ ated@@ . the magnesium was stopped and she recovered over a few day@@ s. while she was weak , 2 @-@ h@@ z repetitive stimulation revealed a decrement without significant facilitation at rapid rates or after exercise , suggesting postsynaptic neuromuscular bloc@@ k@@ ade@@ . after her strength returned , repetitive stimulation was normal , but single fiber em@@ g revealed increased j@@ itter and bloc@@ k@@ ing@@ . her acetylcholine receptor antibody level was markedly elev@@ ated@@ . although paralysis after magnesium administration has been described in patients with known myasthenia gravis , it has not previously been reported to be the initial or only manifestation of the dise@@ as@@ e. patients who are unusually sensitive to the neuromuscular effects of magnesium should be suspected of having an underlying disorder of neuromuscular transmission .
chloro@@ acetaldehyde and its contribution to uro@@ toxicity during treatment with cyclophosphamide or ifos@@ fam@@ ide@@ . an experimental study / short communic@@ ation@@ . based on clinical data , indicating that chloro@@ acetaldehyde ( ca@@ a ) is an important metabolite of ox@@ az@@ aphosph@@ or@@ ine cyto@@ st@@ atics , an experimental study was carried out in order to elucidate the role of ca@@ a in the development of hemorrhagic cy@@ sti@@ tis@@ . the data demonstrate that ca@@ a after i.v. administration does not contribute to bladder dam@@ ag@@ e. when instilled directly into the bladder , ca@@ a exerts uro@@ toxic effects , it is , however , susceptible to detoxification with mes@@ na .
source of pain and primitive dysfunction in migraine : an identical site ? twenty common migraine patients received a one sided frontotemporal application of nitroglycerin ( 10 patients ) or placebo ointment ( 10 patients ) in a double blind stud@@ y@@ . early onset migraine attacks were induced by nitroglycerin in seven out of 10 patients versus no patient in the placebo grou@@ p. subsequently 20 migraine patients , who developed an early onset attack with frontotemporal nitroglycerin , received the drug in a second induction test at other body are@@ as@@ . no early onset migraine was obser@@ ve@@ d. thus the migraine @-@ inducing effect of nitroglycerin seems to depend on direct stimulation of the habitual site of pain , suggesting that the frontotemporal region is of crucial importance in the development of a migraine cri@@ si@@ s. this is not consistent with a c@@ ns origin of migraine attack .
cl@@ oti@@ azepam @-@ induced acute hepati@@ tis@@ . we report the case of a patient who developed acute hepatitis with extensive hepatocellular necrosis , 7 months after the onset of administration of cl@@ oti@@ azepam , a thi@@ en@@ odi@@ azepine deriv@@ ati@@ ve@@ . cl@@ oti@@ azepam withdrawal was followed by prompt recover@@ y@@ . the administration of several benzodiazepines , chemically related to cl@@ oti@@ azepam , did not interfere with recovery and did not induce any relapse of hepati@@ tis@@ . this observation shows that cl@@ oti@@ azepam can induce acute hepatitis and suggests that there is no cross hepatotoxicity between cl@@ oti@@ azepam and several benzodiazepines .
arterial hypertension as a complication of prolonged ketoconazole treat@@ ment@@ . two of 14 patients with c@@ ushing &apos;s syndrome treated on a long @-@ term basis with ketoconazole developed sustained hyper@@ ten@@ sion@@ . in both cases normal plasma and urinary free cortisol levels had been achieved following ketoconazole therapy , yet continuous blood pressure monitoring demonstrated hypertension 31 ( patient 1 ) and 52 weeks ( patient 2 ) after treat@@ ment@@ . in patient 1 , plasma levels of deoxy@@ corticosterone and 11 @-@ deoxy@@ cortisol were elev@@ ated@@ . in patient 2 , in addition to an increase in both deoxy@@ corticosterone and 11 @-@ deoxy@@ cortisol levels , plasma aldosterone values were raised , with a concomitant suppression of renin lev@@ el@@ s. our findings show that long @-@ term treatment with high doses of ketoconazole may induce enzyme blockade leading to mineralocorticoid @-@ related hypertension .
effects of an inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme ( captopril ) on pulmonary and renal insufficiency due to intravascular coagulation in the rat@@ . induction of intravascular coagulation and inhibition of fibrinolysis by injection of thrombin and tranexamic acid ( am@@ ca ) in the rat gives rise to pulmonary and renal insufficiency resembling that occurring after trauma or sepsis in man@@ . injection of captopril ( 1 mg / kg ) , an inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme ( ace ) , reduced both pulmonary and renal insufficiency in this rat mod@@ el@@ . the lung weights were lower and pa@@ o@@ 2 was improved in rats given this enzyme @-@ blocking ag@@ ent@@ . the contents of albumin in the lungs were not changed , indicating that captopril did not influence the extravasation of protein@@ . renal damage as reflected by an increase in serum urea and in kidney weight was prevented by captop@@ ril@@ . the amount of fibrin in the kidneys was also considerably lower than in animals which received thrombin and am@@ ca al@@ on@@ e. it is suggested that the effects of captopril on the lungs may be attributable to a vasodilatory effect due to a reduction in the circulating level of angi@@ ot@@ ension ii and an increase in prostacyclin ( secondary to an increase in bradykinin ) . captopril may , by the same mechanism , reduce the increase in glomerular filtration that is known to occur after an injection of thrombin , thereby diminishing the aggregation of fibrin monomers in the glomeruli , with the result that less fibrin will be deposited and thus less kidney damage will be produced .
a randomized comparison of lab@@ et@@ alol and nitroprusside for induced hypot@@ en@@ sion@@ . in a randomized study , lab@@ et@@ alol @-@ induced hypotension and nitroprusside @-@ induced hypotension were compared in 20 patients ( 10 in each group ) scheduled for major orthopedic proced@@ u@@ res@@ . each patient was subjected to an identical anesthetic protocol and similar drug @-@ induced reductions in mean arterial blood pressure ( bp ) ( 50 to 55 mm@@ h@@ g ) . nitroprusside infusion was associated with a significant ( p less than 0.05 ) increase in heart rate and cardiac output ; rebound hypertension was observed in three patients after discontinuation of nitro@@ prus@@ side@@ . lab@@ et@@ alol administration was not associated with any of these fin@@ d@@ ing@@ s. arterial po@@ 2 decreased in both grou@@ ps@@ . it was concluded that lab@@ et@@ alol offers advantages over nitroprusside .
chronic carbamazepine treatment in the rat : efficacy , toxicity , and effect on plasma and tissue folate concentr@@ ation@@ s. folate depletion has often been a problem in chronic antiepileptic drug ( a@@ ed ) therap@@ y@@ . carbamazepine ( c@@ b@@ z ) , a commonly used a@@ ed , has been implicated in some clinical studi@@ es@@ . a rat model was developed to examine the effects of chronic c@@ b@@ z treatment on folate concentrations in the rat@@ . in the course of developing this model , a common vehicle , propylene glycol , by itself in high doses , was found to exhibit protective properties against induced seizures and inhibited weight g@@ ain@@ . seizures induced by hex@@ afluoro@@ diethyl ether ( h@@ f@@ de ) were also found to be a more sensitive measure of protection by c@@ b@@ z than seizures induced by maximal electro@@ shock ( mes ) . oral administration of c@@ b@@ z as an aqueous suspension every 8 h at a dose of 250 mg / kg was continuously protective against h@@ f@@ de @-@ induced seizures and was minimally toxic as measured by weight gain over 8 weeks of treat@@ ment@@ . the c@@ b@@ z levels measured in plasma and brain of these animals , however , were below those normally considered protec@@ ti@@ ve@@ . this treatment with c@@ b@@ z had no apparent adverse effect on folate concentrations in the rat , and , indeed , the folate concentration increased in liver after 6 weeks of treatment and in plasma at 8 weeks of treatment .
inhibition of sympatho@@ adrenal activity by atrial natriuretic factor in dog@@ s. in six conscious , trained dogs , maintained on a normal sodium intake of 2 to 4 me@@ q / kg / day , sympathetic activity was assessed as the release rate of norepinephrine and epinephrine during 15 @-@ minute i.v. infusions of human alpha @-@ atrial natriuretic factor@@ . mean arterial pressure ( as a percentage of control + / - se@@ m ) during randomized infusions of 0.03 , 0.1 , 0.3 , or 1.0 microgram / kg / min was 99 + / - 1 , 95 + / - 1 ( p less than 0.05 ) , 93 + / - 1 ( p less than 0.01 ) , or 79 + / - 6 % ( p less than 0.001 ) , respectively , but no tachycardia and no augmentation of the norepinephrine release rate ( up to 0.3 microgram / kg / min ) were observed , which is in contrast to comparable hypotension induced by hydralazine or nitro@@ glycer@@ in@@ . the release rate of epinephrine ( control , 6.7 + / - 0.6 ng / kg / min ) declined immediately during infusions of atrial natriuretic factor to a minimum of 49 + / - 5 % of control ( p less than 0.001 ) during 0.1 microgram / kg / min and to 63 + / - 5 % ( 0.1 greater than p greater than 0.05 ) or 95 + / - 13 % ( not significant ) during 0.3 or 1.0 microgram / kg / min@@ . steady state arterial plasma concentrations of atrial natriuretic factor were 39 + / - 10 pg / ml ( n = 6 ) during infusions of saline and 284 + / - 24 pg / ml ( n = 6 ) and 15@@ 20 + / - 300 pg / ml ( n = 9 ) during 0.03 and 0.1 microgram / kg / min infusions of the factor .

death from chemotherapy in gestational trophoblastic dise@@ as@@ e. multiple cytotoxic drug administration is the generally accepted treatment of patients with a high @-@ risk stage of chori@@ ocarcin@@ om@@ a. based on this principle a 27 @-@ year old woman , classified as being in the high @-@ risk group ( gold@@ stein and ber@@ k@@ ow@@ itz score : 11 ) , was treated with multiple cytotoxic dru@@ g@@ s. the multiple drug schema consisted of : etoposide 16.@@ 213 , methotrexate , cyclophosphamide , actom@@ ycin @-@ d , and cis@@ pl@@ atin@@ . on the first day of the schedule , moderate high doses of methotrexate , etoposide and cyclophosphamide were admini@@ stere@@ d. within 8 hours after initiation of therapy the patient died with a clinical picture resembling massive pulmonary obstruction due to chori@@ ocarcin@@ omic tissue plugs , probably originating from the uter@@ us@@ . formation of these plugs was probably due to extensive tumor necrosis at the level of the walls of the major uterine veins , which resulted in an open exchange of tumor plugs to the vascular spaces ; decrease in tumor tissue coherence secondary to chemotherapy may have further contributed to the formation of tumor embol@@ i. in view of the close time association between the start of chemotherapy and the acute onset of massive embolism other explanations , such as spontaneous necrosis , must be considered less lik@@ el@@ y@@ . patients with large pelvic tumor loads are , according to existing classifications , at high risk to die and to develop drug resist@@ anc@@ e. not@@ withstanding these facts our findings suggest that these patients might benefit from relatively mild initial treatment , especially true for patients not previously exposed to this dru@@ g. close observation of the response status both clinically and with beta @-@ h@@ c@@ g values may indicate whether and when more ag@@ ressive combination chemotherapy should be started .

sexual dysfunction among patients with arth@@ ri@@ tis@@ . the relationship of arthritis and sexual dysfunction was investigated among 169 patients with rheumatoid arthritis , osteoarthritis and spondylo@@ arthropathy , 130 of whom were pair @-@ matched to contro@@ l@@ s. assessments of marital happiness and depressed mood were also made using the ces @-@ d and the az@@ rin marital happiness scale ( am@@ hs ) . sexual dysfunctions were found to be common among patients and controls , the majority in both groups reporting one or more dys@@ function@@ s. impotence was more common among male patients than controls and was found to be associated with co @-@ morbidity and the taking of meth@@ ot@@ rex@@ at@@ e. depressed mood was more common among patients and was associated with certain sexual difficulties , but not with im@@ pot@@ enc@@ e. marital un@@ happiness , as indicated by am@@ hs scores , was not associated with arthritis but was associated with sexual dysfunction , sexual dissatisfaction and being female .
does paracetamol cause urothelial cancer or renal papillary necrosis ? the risk of developing renal papillary necrosis or cancer of the renal pelvis , ureter or bladder associated with consumption of either phen@@ ace@@ tin or paracetamol was calculated from data acquired by questionnaire from 381 cases and 80@@ 8 contro@@ l@@ s. the risk of renal papillary necrosis was increased nearly 20 @-@ fold by consumption of phen@@ ace@@ tin , which also increased the risk for cancer of the renal pelvis and bladder but not for ureteric cancer@@ . by contrast , we were unable to substantiate an increased risk from paracetamol consumption for renal papillary necrosis or any of these cancers although there was a suggestion of an association with cancer of the ureter .
dapsone @-@ associated he@@ in@@ z body hemolytic anemia in a cam@@ bo@@ dian woman with hemoglobin e tra@@ it@@ . a cam@@ bo@@ dian woman with hemoglobin e trait ( ae ) and leprosy developed a he@@ in@@ z body hemolytic anemia while taking a dose of dapsone ( 50 mg / day ) not usually associated with clinical hem@@ ol@@ ysi@@ s. her red blood cells ( r@@ b@@ cs ) had increased incubated he@@ in@@ z body formation , decreased reduced glutathione ( g@@ sh ) , and decreased g@@ sh stabil@@ it@@ y@@ . the pentose phosphate shunt activity of the dapsone @-@ exposed ae r@@ b@@ cs was increased compared to normal r@@ bc@@ s. although the ae r@@ b@@ cs from an individual not taking dapsone had increased incubated he@@ in@@ z body formation , the g@@ sh content and g@@ sh stability were normal@@ . the pentose phosphate shunt activity of the non @-@ dapsone @-@ exposed ae r@@ b@@ cs was decreased compared to normal r@@ bc@@ s. thus , ae r@@ b@@ cs appear to have an increased sensitivity to oxidant stress both in vitro and in vivo , since dapsone does not cause hemolytic anemia at this dose in hemat@@ ologically normal individu@@ al@@ s. given the influx of sou@@ theast asi@@ ans into the un@@ ited states , oxidant medications should be used with caution , especially if an infection is present , in individuals of ethnic backgrounds that have an increased prevalence of hemoglobin e .
severe complications of anti@@ anginal drug therapy in a patient identified as a poor metabol@@ izer of metoprolol , pro@@ pa@@ fen@@ one , diltiazem , and spar@@ te@@ ine@@ . a 47 @-@ year @-@ old patient suffering from coronary artery disease was admitted to the cc@@ u in shock with i@@ i@@ i. a@@ v block , severe hypotension , and impairment of ventricular function@@ . one week prior to admission a therapy with standard doses of metoprolol ( 100 mg t.@@ i.d. and then 100 mg b.i.d. ) had been initi@@ ated@@ . two days before admission diltiazem ( 60 mg b.i.d. ) was prescribed in addi@@ tion@@ . analyses of a blood sample revealed unusually high plasma concentrations of metoprolol ( greater than 3000 ng / ml ) and diltiazem ( 5@@ 26 ng / ml ) . the patient recovered within 1 week following discontinuation of anti@@ anginal therap@@ y@@ . three months later the patient was exposed to a single dose of metoprolol , diltiazem , pro@@ pa@@ fen@@ one ( since he had received this drug in the past ) , and spar@@ te@@ ine ( as a probe for the deb@@ ris@@ o@@ quine / spar@@ te@@ ine type polymorphism of oxidative drug metabolism ) . it was found that he was a poor metabol@@ izer of all four drugs , indicating that their metabolism is under the same genetic contro@@ l@@ . therefore , patients belonging to the poor @-@ metabol@@ izer phenotype of spar@@ te@@ ine / deb@@ ris@@ o@@ quine polymorphism in drug metabolism , which constitutes 6.4 % of the ger@@ man population , may experience adverse drug reactions when treated with standard doses of one of these drugs al@@ on@@ e. moreover , the coadministration of these frequently used drugs is expected to be especially harmful in this subgroup of patients .
tri@@ azolam @-@ induced brief episodes of secondary mania in a depressed patient@@ . large doses of tri@@ azolam repeatedly induced brief episodes of mania in a depressed elderly wom@@ an@@ . features of organic mental disorder ( delirium ) were not present@@ . manic excit@@ ement was coincident with the duration of action of tri@@ azol@@ am@@ . the possible contribution of the tri@@ azol@@ o group to changes in affective status is discussed .
on the mechanisms of the development of tolerance to the muscular rigidity produced by morphine in rat@@ s. the development of tolerance to the muscular rigidity produced by morphine was studied in rat@@ s. saline @-@ pretreated controls given a test dose of morphine ( 20 mg / kg i.p. ) showed a pronounced rigidity recorded as tonic activity in the electromy@@ ogram@@ . rats treated for 11 days with morphine and withdrawn for 36 @-@ 40 h showed differences in the development of tolerance : about half of the animals showed a rigidity after the test dose of morphine that was not significantly less than in the controls and were a@@ kinetic ( a group ) . the other rats showed a strong decrease in the rigidity and the occurrence of stereotyped ( s ) l@@ icking and / or gn@@ aw@@ ing in presence of a@@ kinetic or hyper@@ kinetic ( k ) behaviour ( as / ks group ) , suggesting signs of dopaminergic activ@@ ation@@ . the rigidity was considerably decreased in both groups after 20 days &apos; treat@@ ment@@ . in a further series of experiments , haloperidol ( 0.2 mg / kg i.p. ) was used in order to block the dopaminergic activation and to estimate the real degree of the tolerance to the rigidity without any dopaminergic inter@@ feren@@ c@@ e. haloperidol enhanced the rigidity in the a grou@@ p. however , the level in the as / ks group remained considerably lower than in the a grou@@ p. the results suggest that rigidity , which is assumed to be due to an action of morphine in the striatum , can be antagonized by another process leading to dopaminergic activation in the stri@@ at@@ um@@ . nevertheless , there occurs some real tolerance to this effec@@ t. the rapid altern@@ ations of rigidity and the signs of dopaminergic activation observed in the animals of the as / ks group might be due to rapid shifts in the predominance of various da @-@ innervated structures .
compression neuropathy of the radial nerve due to pent@@ azocine @-@ induced fibrous my@@ opath@@ y@@ . fibrous myopathy is a common , well @-@ known side effect of repeated pent@@ azocine injec@@ tion@@ . however , compression neuropathy due to fibrotic muscle affected by pent@@ azocine @-@ induced myopathy has not previously been repor@@ te@@ d. in a 37 @-@ year @-@ old woman with documented pent@@ azocine @-@ induced fibrous myopathy of triceps and deltoid muscles bilaterally and a three @-@ week history of right wrist drop , electro@@ diagnostic examination showed a severe but partial lesion of the right radial nerve distal to the branches to the triceps , in addition to the fibrous my@@ opath@@ y@@ . surgery revealed the right radial nerve to be severely compressed by the densely fibrotic lateral head of the tric@@ ep@@ s. decompression and neuro@@ lysis were performed with good subsequent recovery of function .
recurrent reversible acute renal failure from amphoter@@ ic@@ in@@ . a patient with cryptogenic cirrhosis and disseminated sporo@@ tricho@@ sis developed acute renal failure immediately following the administration of amphotericin b on four separate occa@@ sion@@ s. the abrup@@ tness of the renal failure and its reversibility within days suggests that there was a functional component to the renal dys@@ function@@ . we propose that amphotericin , in the setting of reduced effective arterial volume , may activate tubul@@ og@@ lomerular feedback , thereby contributing to acute renal failure .
pneumonitis with pleural and pericardial effusion and neuropathy during amiodarone therap@@ y@@ . a patient with sin@@ u@@ atrial disease and implanted pacemaker was treated with amiodarone ( maximum dose 1000 mg , maintenance dose 800 mg daily ) for 10 months , for control of supraventricular tachy@@ arrhyth@@ mi@@ as@@ . he developed pneumonitis , pleural and pericardial effusions , and a predominantly proximal motor neuro@@ path@@ y@@ . immediate but gradual improvement followed withdrawal of amiodarone and treatment with predn@@ isol@@ on@@ e. review of this and previously reported cases indicates the need for early diagnosis of amiodarone pneumonitis , immediate withdrawal of amiodarone , and prompt but continued steroid therapy to ensure full recovery .
indomethacin @-@ induced renal insufficiency : recurrence on re@@ challeng@@ e. we have reported a case of acute olig@@ uric renal failure with hyperkalemia in a patient with cirrhosis , ascites , and c@@ or pulmon@@ ale after indomethacin therap@@ y@@ . prompt restoration of renal function followed drug withdrawal , while re @-@ exposure to a single dose of indomethacin caused recurrence of acute reversible olig@@ ur@@ i@@ a. our case supports the hypothesis that endogenous renal prostaglandins play a role in the maintenance of renal blood flow when circulating plasma volume is dimin@@ is@@ he@@ d. since nonsteroidal anti @-@ inflammatory agents interfere with this compensatory mechanism and may cause acute renal failure , they should be used with caution in such patients .
comparison of the subjective effects and plasma concentrations following oral and i.m. administration of flun@@ it@@ razepam in volunte@@ er@@ s. flun@@ it@@ razepam 0.5 , 1.0 or 2.0 mg was given by the oral or i.m. routes to groups of volunteers and its effects com@@ pa@@ red@@ . plasma concentrations of the drug were estimated by gas @-@ liquid chromatography , in a smaller number of the subjec@@ ts@@ . the most striking effect was sedation which increased with the dose , 2 mg producing deep sleep although the subjects could still be aro@@ us@@ ed@@ . the effects of i.m. administration were apparent earlier and sometimes lasted longer than those following oral administr@@ ation@@ . dizziness was less marked than sedation , but increased with the dos@@ e. there was pain on i.m. injection of flun@@ it@@ razepam significantly more often than with isotonic sal@@ ine@@ . plasma concentrations varied with dose and route and corresponded qualitatively with the subjective effec@@ ts@@ . the drug was still present in measurable quantities after 24 h even with the smallest dose .
changes in heart size during long @-@ term timolol treatment after myocardial infarc@@ tion@@ . the effect of long @-@ term timolol treatment on heart size after myocardial infarction was evaluated by x @-@ ray in a double @-@ blind study including 241 patients ( placebo 126 , timolol 115 ) . the follow @-@ up period was 12 mon@@ th@@ s. the timolol @-@ treated patients showed a small but significant increase in heart size from baseline in contrast to a decrease in the placebo grou@@ p. these differences may be caused by timolol @-@ induced bradycardia and a compensatory increase in end @-@ diastolic volu@@ me@@ . the timolol @-@ related increase in heart size was observed only in patients with normal and borderline heart si@@ z@@ e. in patients with cardi@@ omegaly , the increase in heart size was similar in both grou@@ ps@@ . after re @-@ infarction , heart size increased in the placebo group and remained unchanged in the timolol group .
vitamin d@@ 3 toxicity in dairy cow@@ s. large parenteral doses of vitamin d@@ 3 ( 15 to 17.5 x 10 ( 6 ) i@@ u vitamin d@@ 3 ) were associated with prolonged hypercalcemia , hyper@@ phosphat@@ emia , and large increases of vitamin d@@ 3 and its metabolites in the blood plasma of non@@ lactating nonpregnant and pregnant jer@@ sey cow@@ s. calcium concentrations 1 day postpartum were higher in cows treated with vitamin d@@ 3 about 32 days pre@@ partum ( 8.8 mg / 100 ml ) than in control cows ( 5.5 mg / 100 ml ) . none of the cows treated with vitamin d@@ 3 showed signs of milk fever during the peri@@ par@@ tal period ; however , 22 % of the control cows developed clinical signs of milk fever during this period@@ . signs of vitamin d@@ 3 toxicity were not observed in non@@ lactating nonpregnant cows ; however , pregnant cows commonly developed severe signs of vitamin d@@ 3 toxicity and 10 of 17 cows di@@ ed@@ . there was widespread metastatic calcification in the cows that di@@ ed@@ . because of the extreme toxicity of vitamin d@@ 3 in pregnant jer@@ sey cows and the low margin of safety between doses of vitamin d@@ 3 that prevent milk fever and doses that induce milk fever , we concluded that vitamin d@@ 3 cannot be used practically to prevent milk fever when injected several weeks pre@@ partum .
diseases of peripheral nerves as seen in the nig@@ erian af@@ ric@@ an@@ . the anatomical and aetiological diagnoses of peripheral nerve disease excluding its primary benign and malignant disorders , as seen in 358 nig@@ eri@@ ans are pres@@ ente@@ d. there is a male preponderance and the peak incidence is in the fourth dec@@ ade@@ . sens@@ ori @-@ motor neuropathy was the commonest presentation ( 50 % ) . gu@@ ill@@ ain @-@ bar@@ r syndrome was the commonest identifiable cause ( 15.6 % ) , accounting for half of the cases with motor neuro@@ path@@ y@@ . peripheral neuropathy due to nutritional deficiency of thiamine and riboflavin was common ( 10.1 % ) and presented mainly as sensory and sens@@ ori @-@ motor neuro@@ path@@ y@@ . diabetes mellitus was the major cause of autonomic neuro@@ path@@ y@@ . isoniazid was the most frequent agent in drug @-@ induced neuro@@ path@@ y@@ . migraine ( 20 % ) was not an uncommon cause of cranial neuropathy although malignancies arising from the reticulo@@ endothelial system or related structures of the head and neck were more frequent ( 26 % ) . in 26.5 % of all the cases , the aetiology of the neuropathy was un@@ determin@@ ed@@ . here@@ do@@ familial and connective tissue disorders were ra@@ re@@ . some of the factors related to the clinical presentation and pathogenesis of the neuropathies are briefly discussed .
a double @-@ blind study of the efficacy and safety of do@@ thi@@ epin hydrochloride in the treatment of major depressive dis@@ or@@ der@@ . in a 6 @-@ week double @-@ blind parallel treatment study , do@@ thi@@ epin and amitriptyline were compared to placebo in the treatment of 33 depressed out@@ patient@@ s. do@@ thi@@ epin and amitriptyline were equally effective in alleviating the symptoms of depressive illness , and both were significantly superior to plac@@ e@@ bo@@ . the overall incidence of side effects and the frequency and severity of blur@@ red vision , dry mouth , and drow@@ siness were significantly less with do@@ thi@@ epin than with amit@@ rip@@ t@@ yl@@ ine@@ . do@@ thi@@ epin also produced fewer c@@ ns and cardiovascular effec@@ ts@@ . there were no clinically important changes in laboratory parameter@@ s. do@@ thi@@ epin thus was found to be an effective antidepressant drug associated with fewer side effects than amitriptyline in the treatment of depressed outpatients .
behavioral effects of diazepam and propranolol in patients with panic disorder and ag@@ or@@ aph@@ obi@@ a. the effects of oral doses of diazepam ( single dose of 10 mg and a median dose of 30 mg / day for 2 weeks ) and propranolol ( single dose of 80 mg and a median dose of 240 mg / day for 2 weeks ) on psychological performance of patients with panic disorders and ag@@ or@@ aph@@ obia were investigated in a double @-@ blind , randomized and crossover design@@ . both drugs impaired immediate free recall but the decrease was greater for diazepam than pro@@ pran@@ ol@@ ol@@ . delayed free recall was also impaired but the two drugs did not diff@@ er@@ . patients t@@ apped faster after propranolol than diazepam and they were more sedated after diazepam than pro@@ pran@@ ol@@ ol@@ . after 2 weeks of treatment , patients tested 5 @-@ 8 h after the last dose of medication did not show any decrement of perform@@ anc@@ e. these results are similar to those previously found in healthy subjec@@ ts@@ . accumulation of drugs was not reflected in prolonged behavioral impairment .
effect of aspirin on n@@ - &#91; 4- ( 5 @-@ nitro @-@ 2 @-@ fur@@ yl ) -2 @-@ thiazol@@ yl &#93; -@@ formamide @-@ induced epithelial proliferation in the urinary bladder and fore@@ stomach of the rat@@ . the co @-@ administration of aspirin with n@@ - &#91; 4- ( 5 @-@ nitro @-@ 2 @-@ fur@@ yl ) -2 @-@ thiazol@@ yl &#93; -@@ formamide ( f@@ an@@ ft ) to rats resulted in a reduced incidence of f@@ an@@ ft @-@ induced bladder carcinomas but a concomitant induction of fore@@ stomach tumor@@ s. an autoradiographic study was performed on male f @-@ 344 rats fed diet containing f@@ an@@ ft at a level of 0.2 % and / or aspirin at a level of 0.5 % to evaluate the effect of aspirin on the increased cell proliferation induced by f@@ an@@ ft in the fore@@ stomach and bl@@ ad@@ der@@ . f@@ an@@ ft @-@ induced cell proliferation in the bladder was significantly suppressed by aspirin co @-@ administration after 4 weeks but not after 12 week@@ s. in the fore@@ stomach , and also in the liver , aspirin did not affect the f@@ an@@ ft @-@ induced increase in labeling index@@ . the present results are consistent with the carcinogenicity experiment suggesting that different mechanisms are involved in f@@ an@@ ft carcinogenesis in the bladder and fore@@ stomach , and that aspirin &apos;s effect on f@@ an@@ ft in the fore@@ stomach is not due to an irritant effect associated with increased cell prolifer@@ ation@@ . also , there appears to be an adaptation by the rats to the chronic ingestion of aspirin .
provocation of postural hypotension by nitroglycerin in diabetic autonomic neuropathy ? the effect of nitroglycerin on heart rate and systolic blood pressure was compared in 5 normal subjects , 12 diabetic subjects without autonomic neuropathy , and 5 diabetic subjects with autonomic neuro@@ path@@ y@@ . the magnitude and time course of the increase in heart rate and the decrease in systolic blood pressure after nitroglycerin were similar in the normal and diabetic subjects without autonomic neuropathy , whereas a lesser increase in heart rate and a greater decrease in systolic blood pressure occurred in the diabetic subjects with autonomic neuro@@ path@@ y@@ . it is therefore suggested that caution should be exercised when prescribing vasodilator drugs in diabetic patients , particularly those with autonomic neuropathy .
characterization of estrogen @-@ induced adeno@@ hypophyseal tumors in the f@@ ischer 344 rat@@ . pituitary tumors were induced in f@@ 344 female rats by chronic treatment with diethyl@@ stilbestrol ( des , 8 @-@ 10 mg ) implanted subcutaneously in si@@ lastic capsul@@ es@@ . over a range of 1 @-@ 150 days of des treatment , pairs of control and des @-@ treated rats were sacrificed , and their p@@ ituit@@ aries dissociated enzymatically into single @-@ cell prepar@@ ation@@ s. the cell populations were examined regarding total cell recovery correlated with gland weight , intracellular prolactin ( pr@@ l ) content and subsequent release in primary culture , immunocytochemical pr@@ l staining , density and / or size alterations via separation on fic@@ ol@@ l @-@ hy@@ pa@@ que and by unit gravity sedimentation , and cell cycle analysis , after acr@@ if@@ lav@@ ine d@@ na staining , by laser flow cyt@@ ometr@@ y@@ . total cell yields from des @-@ treated p@@ ituit@@ aries increased from 1.3 times control yields at 8 days of treatment to 5@@ 8.9 times control values by day 150@@ . intracellular pr@@ l content ranged from 1.9 to 9.4 times control levels , and pr@@ l release in vitro was significantly and consistently higher than controls , after at least 8 days of des expos@@ ure@@ . beyond 8 days of des exposure , the immuno@@ chemically pr@@ l @-@ positive proportion of cells increased to over 50 % of the total popul@@ ation@@ . increased density and / or size and pr@@ l content were indicated for the majority of the pr@@ l cell population in both types of separation protoc@@ ol@@ s. all these effects of des were more pronounced among previously ovariectomized anim@@ al@@ s. the data extend the findings of other investigators , further establishing the des @-@ induced tumor as a model for study of pr@@ l cellular control mechanisms .

metabolic involvement in adriamycin cardi@@ otoxic@@ it@@ y@@ . the cardi@@ otoxic effects of adriamycin were studied in mammalian myocardial cells in culture as a model system@@ . adriamycin inhibited cell growth and the rhythmic contractions characteristic of myocardial cells in cul@@ ture@@ . a possible involvement of energy metabolism was suggested previously , and in this study the adenylate energy charge and phosphoryl@@ creatine mole fraction were determined in the adriamycin @-@ treated cell@@ s. the adenylate energy charge was found to be significantly decreased , while the ph@@ oph@@ or@@ yl@@ creatine mole fraction was un@@ chang@@ ed@@ . such disparity suggests an inhibition of creatine phospho@@ kin@@ as@@ e. the addition of 1 mm adenosine to the myocardial cell cultures markedly increases the at@@ p concentration through a pathway reportedly leading to a compartment@@ alized at@@ p po@@ ol@@ . in the adriamycin @-@ treated cells , the addition of adenosine increased the adenylate charge and , concomitant with this in@@ r@@ c@@ ease , the cells &apos; functional integrity , in terms of percentage of beating cells and rate of contractions , was maintained .
age @-@ dependent sensitivity of the rat to neurotoxic effects of streptom@@ y@@ cin@@ . streptomycin sulfate ( 300 mg / kg s.c. ) was injected for various periods into pre@@ weanling rats and for 3 weeks into weanling rat@@ s. beginning at 8 days of age , body movement and hearing were examined for 6 and up to 17 weeks , respec@@ ti@@ vel@@ y@@ . abnormal movements and deafness occurred only in rats treated during the pre@@ weaning period ; within this period the greatest sensitivities for these abnormalities occurred from 2 to 11 @-@ 17 and 5 to 11 days of age , respectively , indicating that the cochlea is more sensitive to streptomycin than the site ( vestibular or central ) responsible for the dys@@ kine@@ sias .
cresc@@ en@@ tic fibrillary glomerulonephritis associated with intermittent rifampin therapy for pulmonary tubercul@@ osi@@ s. this case study reveals an unusual finding of rapidly proliferative cresc@@ en@@ tic glomerulonephritis in a patient treated with rifampin who had no other identifiable causes for developing this dise@@ as@@ e. this patient underwent a 10 @-@ month regimen of rifampin and isoniazid for pulmonary tuberculosis and was discovered to have developed signs of severe renal failure five weeks after completion of therap@@ y@@ . renal biopsy revealed severe glomerulonephritis with cresc@@ ents , electron dense fibrillar deposits and moderate lymphocytic interstitial infiltr@@ at@@ e. other possible causes of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis were investigated and ruled out@@ . this report documents the unusual occurrence of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis with cresc@@ ents and fibrillar glomerulonephritis in a patient treated with rifampin .
time course of lipid peroxidation in puromycin amin@@ onucle@@ oside @-@ induced nephro@@ path@@ y@@ . reactive oxygen species have been implicated in the pathogenesis of acute puromycin amin@@ onucle@@ oside ( pan ) -induced nephropathy , with antioxidants significantly reducing the protein@@ ur@@ i@@ a. the temporal relationship between lipid peroxidation in the kidney and proteinuria was examined in this stud@@ y@@ . rats were treated with a single iv injection of puromycin amin@@ onucle@@ oside , ( pan , 7.5 mg / kg ) and 24 hour urine samples were obtained prior to sacrifice on days 3,@@ 5,@@ 7,@@ 10,@@ 17,@@ 27,@@ 41 ( n = 5 @-@ 10 per group ) . the kidneys were removed , fl@@ ushed with ice cold tris buff@@ er@@ . kidney cortices from each animal were used to prepare homogen@@ at@@ es@@ . tissue lipid peroxidation was measured in whole homogenates as well as in lipid extracts from homogenates as thiobarbituric acid reactive subst@@ anc@@ es@@ . proteinuria was evident at day 5 , peaked at day 7 and persisted to day 27@@ . lipid peroxidation in homogenates was maximal at day 3 and declined rapidly to control levels by day 17@@ . this study supports the role of lipid peroxidation in mediating the protein@@ uric injury in pan nephropathy .
clomi@@ pramine @-@ induced sleep disturbance does not impair its prolactin @-@ releasing action@@ . the present study was undertaken to examine the role of sleep disturbance , induced by clomi@@ pramine administration , on the secretory rate of prolactin ( pr@@ l ) in addition to the direct drug effec@@ t. two groups of supine subjects were studied under placebo @-@ controlled conditions , one during the night , when sleeping ( n = 7 ) and the other at daytime , when awake ( n = 6 ) . each subject received a single 50 mg dose of clomi@@ pramine given orally 2 hours before blood collec@@ tion@@ . plasma pr@@ l concentrations were analysed at 10 min intervals and underlying secretory rates calculated by a deconvolution proced@@ ure@@ . for both experiments the drug intake led to significant increases in pr@@ l secretion , acting preferentially on tonic secretion as pulse amplitude and frequency did not differ significantly from corresponding control valu@@ es@@ . during the night clomi@@ pramine ingestion altered the complete sleep architecture in that it suppressed re@@ m sleep and the sleep cycles and induced increased wake@@ ful@@ ness@@ . as the relative increase in pr@@ l secretion expressed as a percentage of the mean did not significantly differ between the night and day time studies ( 46 + / - 19 % vs 34 + / - 10 % ) , it can be concluded that the observed sleep disturbance did not interfere with the drug action per se@@ . the presence of re@@ m sleep was shown not to be a determining factor either for secretory pulse amplitude and frequency , as , for both , mean nocturnal values were similar with and without prior clomi@@ pramine ingestion .

effect of con@@ i@@ ine on the developing chick embry@@ o. con@@ i@@ ine , an alkaloid from con@@ ium macul@@ atum ( poison hem@@ lock ) , has been shown to be teratogenic in live@@ st@@ ock@@ . the major teratogenic outcome is arthro@@ gr@@ y@@ po@@ sis , presumably due to nicotinic receptor bloc@@ k@@ ade@@ . however , con@@ i@@ ine has failed to produce arthro@@ gr@@ y@@ po@@ sis in rats or mice and is only weakly teratogenic in rab@@ bit@@ s. the purpose of this study was to evaluate and compare the effects of con@@ i@@ ine and nicotine in the developing chick@@ . concentrations of con@@ i@@ ine and nicotine sulfate were 0.015 % , 0.03 % , 0.0@@ 75 % , 0.15 % , 0.75 % , 1.5 % , 3 % , and 6 % and 1 % , 5 % , and 10 % , respec@@ ti@@ vel@@ y@@ . both compounds caused deformations and lethality in a dose @-@ dependent man@@ ner@@ . all concentrations of nicotine sulfate caused some lethality but a no effect level for con@@ i@@ ine lethality was 0.75 % . the deformations caused by both con@@ i@@ ine and nicotine sulfate were excessive flexion or extension of one or more to@@ es@@ . no histopathological alterations or differences in bone formation were seen in the limbs or toes of any chicks from any group ; however , extensive cranial hemorrhage occurred in all nicotine sulfate @-@ treated chick@@ s. there was a statistically significant ( p &lt; or = 0.01 ) decrease in movement in con@@ i@@ ine and nicotine sulfate treated chicks as determined by ultras@@ ound@@ . control chicks were in motion an average of 33.@@ 67 % of the time , while con@@ i@@ ine @-@ treated chicks were only moving 8.@@ 95 % of a 5 @-@ min interval , and no movement was observed for nicotine sulfate treated chick@@ s. in summary , the chick embryo provides a reliable and simple experimental animal model of con@@ i@@ ine @-@ induced arthro@@ gr@@ y@@ posi@@ s. data from this model support a mechanism involving nicotinic receptor blockade with subsequent decreased fetal movement .
epidural blood flow during prostaglandin e@@ 1 or trimeth@@ aph@@ an induced hypot@@ en@@ sion@@ . to evaluate the effect of prostaglandin e@@ 1 ( p@@ ge@@ 1 ) or trimeth@@ aph@@ an ( t@@ m@@ p ) induced hypotension on epidural blood flow ( eb@@ f ) during spinal surgery , eb@@ f was measured using the heat clearance method in 30 patients who underwent poster@@ o @-@ lateral interbody fusion under isoflurane anaes@@ thesi@@ a. an initial dose of 0.1 microgram@@ .@@ kg @-@ 1.min @-@ 1 of p@@ ge@@ 1 ( 15 patients ) , or 10 micrograms.@@ kg @-@ 1.min @-@ 1 of t@@ m@@ p ( 15 patients ) was administered intravenously after the dural opening and the dose was adjusted to maintain the mean arterial blood pressure ( map ) at about 60 mm@@ h@@ g. the hypotensive drug was discontinued at the completion of the operative proced@@ ure@@ . after starting p@@ ge@@ 1 or t@@ m@@ p , map and rate pressure product ( r@@ pp ) decreased significantly compared with pre@@ infusion values ( p &lt; 0.01 ) , and the degree of hypotension due to p@@ ge@@ 1 remained constant until 60 min after its discontinu@@ ation@@ . heart rate ( hr ) did not change in either grou@@ p. eb@@ ff did not change during p@@ ge@@ 1 infusion whereas in the t@@ m@@ p group , eb@@ f decreased significantly at 30 and 60 min after the start of t@@ m@@ p ( pre@@ infusion : 4@@ 5.9 + / - 13.9 ml / 100@@ g / min . 30 min : 32.3 + / - 9.9 ml / 100 g / min ( p &lt; 0.05 ) . 60 min : 30 + / - 7.5 ml / 100 g / min ( p &lt; 0.05 ) ) . these results suggest that p@@ ge@@ 1 may be preferable to t@@ m@@ p for hypotensive anaesthesia in spinal surgery because t@@ m@@ p decreased eb@@ f .
immunohistochemical studies with antibodies to neurofilament proteins on axonal damage in experimental focal lesions in rat@@ . immunohistochemistry with monoclonal antibodies against neurofilament ( n@@ f ) proteins of middle and high molecular weight class , n@@ f @-@ m and n@@ f @-@ h , was used to study axonal injury in the bor@@ der@@ zone of focal lesions in rat@@ s. focal injury in the cortex was produced by infusion of lactate at acid ph or by st@@ ab caused by needle inser@@ tion@@ . infarcts in substantia nigra pars reticul@@ ata were evoked by prolonged pilocarpine @-@ induced status epilep@@ tic@@ us@@ . immunohistochemical staining for n@@ fs showed characteristic terminal clu@@ bs of axons in the bor@@ der@@ zone of le@@ sion@@ s. differences in the labelling pattern occurred with different antibodies which apparently depended on molecular weight class of n@@ fs and phosphorylation stat@@ e. these immunohistochemical changes of n@@ fs can serve as a marker for axonal damage in various experimental traumatic or ischemic lesions .

acetaminophen @-@ induced hypot@@ en@@ sion@@ . through 30 years of widespread use , acetaminophen has been shown to be a remarkably safe medication in therapeutic dos@@ ag@@ es@@ . the potential for acetaminophen to produce cardiovascular toxicities is very low@@ . however , acetaminophen has been demonstrated to produce symptoms of anaphylaxis , including hypotension , in sensitive individu@@ al@@ s. this article describes two critically ill patients in whom transient episodes of hypotension reproducibly developed after administration of acet@@ aminophen@@ . other symptoms of allergic reactions were not clinically detec@@ tab@@ le@@ . the hypotensive episodes were severe enough to require vasop@@ ressor administr@@ ation@@ . the reports illustrate the need for clinicians to consider acetaminophen in patients with hypotension of unknown origin .
acute hepatitis , autoimmune hemolytic anemia , and erythro@@ blast@@ ocytopenia induced by cef@@ tri@@ axon@@ e. an 80 @-@ yr @-@ old man developed acute hepatitis shortly after ing@@ esting oral cef@@ tri@@ axon@@ e. although the transaminases gradually returned to baseline after with@@ holding the beta lactam antibiotic , there was a gradual increase in serum bilirubin and a decrease in hemoglobin concentration caused by an autoimmune hemolytic anemia and erythro@@ blast@@ ocyt@@ open@@ i@@ a. these responded to systemic steroids and immunoglob@@ ulin@@ s. despite the widespread use of these agents this triad of side effects has not previously been reported in connection with beta lactam antibiotics .
adverse effects of the atypical anti@@ psycho@@ tic@@ s. collaborative working group on clinical trial evalu@@ ation@@ s. adverse effects of antipsychotics often lead to non@@ compli@@ anc@@ e. thus , clinicians should address patients &apos; concerns about adverse effects and attempt to choose medications that will improve their patients &apos; quality of life as well as overall health@@ . the side effect profiles of the atypical antipsychotics are more advantageous than those of the conventional neurolep@@ tic@@ s. conventional agents are associated with unwanted central nervous system effects , including extrapyramidal symptoms ( eps ) , tardive dyskinesia , sedation , and possible impairment of some cognitive measures , as well as cardiac effects , orthostatic hypotension , hepatic changes , anticholinergic side effects , sexual dysfunction , and weight g@@ ain@@ . the newer atypical agents have a lower risk of eps , but are associated in varying degrees with sedation , cardiovascular effects , anticholinergic effects , weight gain , sexual dysfunction , hepatic effects , lowered seizure threshold ( primarily clozapine ) , and agran@@ ul@@ ocytosis ( clozapine only ) . since the incidence and severity of specific adverse effects differ among the various atyp@@ icals , the clinician should carefully consider which side effects are most likely to lead to the individual &apos;s dissatisfaction and non@@ compliance before choosing an antipsychotic for a particular patient .
effects of tetran@@ dr@@ ine and f@@ ang@@ chin@@ oline on experimental thrombosis in mice and human platelet aggreg@@ ation@@ . tetran@@ dr@@ ine ( tet ) and f@@ ang@@ chin@@ oline ( fan ) are two naturally occurring analogues with a bis@@ benzyl@@ isoquinoline struc@@ ture@@ . the present study was undertaken to investigate the effects of tet and fan on the experimental thrombosis induced by collagen plus epinephrine ( ep ) in mice , and platelet aggregation and blood coagulation in vit@@ ro@@ . in the in vivo study , the administration ( 50 mg / kg , i.p. ) of tet and fan in mice showed the inhibition of thrombosis by 55 % and 35 % , respectively , while acetylsalicylic acid ( as@@ a , 50 mg / kg , i.p. ) , a positive control , showed only 30 % inhib@@ iti@@ on@@ . in the vitro human platelet aggreg@@ ations induced by the agonists used in tests , tet and fan showed the inhib@@ itions dose depend@@ ent@@ ly@@ . in addition , neither tet nor fan showed any anticoagulation activities in the measurement of the activated partial thromboplastin time ( ap@@ t@@ t ) , prothrombin time ( pt ) and thrombin time ( t@@ t ) using human @-@ citr@@ ated plas@@ ma@@ . these results suggest that anti@@ thrombosis of tet and fan in mice may be mainly related to the antiplatelet aggregation activities .

warfarin @-@ induced artery calcification is accelerated by growth and vitamin d. the present studies demonstrate that growth and vitamin d treatment enhance the extent of artery calcification in rats given sufficient doses of warfarin to inhibit gamma @-@ carbox@@ ylation of matrix gl@@ a protein , a calcification inhibitor known to be expressed by smooth muscle cells and macrophages in the artery w@@ all@@ . the first series of experiments examined the influence of age and growth status on artery calcification in warfarin @-@ treated rat@@ s. treatment for 2 weeks with warfarin caused massive focal calcification of the artery media in 20 @-@ day @-@ old rats and less extensive focal calcification in 42 @-@ day @-@ old rat@@ s. in contrast , no artery calcification could be detected in 10 @-@ month @-@ old adult rats even after 4 weeks of warfarin treat@@ ment@@ . to directly examine the importance of growth to warfarin @-@ induced artery calcification in animals of the same age , 20 @-@ day @-@ old rats were fed for 2 weeks either an ad libitum diet or a 6 @-@ g / d restricted diet that maintains weight but prevents grow@@ th@@ . concurrent treatment of both dietary groups with warfarin produced massive focal calcification of the artery media in the ad libitum @-@ fed rats but no detectable artery calcification in the restricted @-@ diet , growth @-@ inhibited grou@@ p. although the explanation for the association between artery calcification and growth status cannot be determined from the present study , there was a relationship between higher serum phosphate and susceptibility to artery calcification , with 30 % higher levels of serum phosphate in young , ad libitum @-@ fed rats compared with either of the groups that was resistant to warfarin @-@ induced artery calcification , ie , the 10 @-@ month @-@ old rats and the restricted @-@ diet , growth @-@ inhibited young rat@@ s. this observation suggests that increased susceptibility to warfarin @-@ induced artery calcification could be related to higher serum phosphate lev@@ el@@ s. the second set of experiments examined the possible synergy between vitamin d and warfarin in artery calc@@ ific@@ ation@@ . high doses of vitamin d are known to cause calcification of the artery media in as little as 3 to 4 day@@ s. high doses of the vitamin k antagonist warfarin are also known to cause calcification of the artery media , but at treatment times of 2 weeks or longer yet not at 1 week@@ . in the current study , we investigated the synergy between these 2 treatments and found that concurrent warfarin administration dramatically increased the extent of calcification in the media of vitamin d @-@ treated rats at 3 and 4 day@@ s. there was a close parallel between the effect of vitamin d dose on artery calcification and the effect of vitamin d dose on the elevation of serum calcium , which suggests that vitamin d may induce artery calcification through its effect on serum calci@@ um@@ . because warfarin treatment had no effect on the elevation in serum calcium produced by vitamin d , the synergy between warfarin and vitamin d is probably best explained by the hypothesis that warfarin inhibits the activity of matrix gl@@ a protein as a calcification inhibit@@ or@@ . high levels of matrix gl@@ a protein are found at sites of artery calcification in rats treated with vitamin d plus warfarin , and chemical analysis showed that the protein that accumulated was indeed not gamma @-@ carbox@@ yl@@ ated@@ . these observations indicate that although the gamma @-@ carboxy@@ glutamate residues of matrix gl@@ a protein are apparently required for its function as a calcification inhibitor , they are not required for its accumulation at calcification sites .
antidepressant @-@ induced mania in bipolar patients : identification of risk factor@@ s. background : concerns about possible risks of switching to mania associated with antidepressants continue to interfere with the establishment of an optimal treatment paradigm for bipolar de@@ pres@@ sion@@ . method : the response of 44 patients meeting ds@@ m @-@ iv criteria for bipolar disorder to naturalistic treatment was assessed for at least 6 weeks using the mont@@ g@@ om@@ ery @-@ as@@ berg depression rating scale and the bec@@ h @-@ ra@@ fa@@ el@@ son mania rating scal@@ e. patients who experienced a manic or hypom@@ anic switch were compared with those who did not on several variables including age , sex , diagnosis ( ds@@ m @-@ iv bipolar i vs. bipolar ii ) , number of previous manic episodes , type of antidepressant therapy used ( electroconvulsive therapy vs. antidepressant drugs and , more particularly , selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors &#91; ss@@ ris &#93; ) , use and type of mood stabilizers ( lithium vs. anticonvulsants ) , and temperament of the patient , assessed during a normo@@ thymic period using the hyper@@ thym@@ ia component of the semi @-@ structured affective temperament interview@@ . results : switches to hypom@@ ania or mania occurred in 27 % of all patients ( n = 12 ) ( and in 24 % of the subgroup of patients treated with ss@@ ris &#91; 8 / 33 &#93; ) ; 16 % ( n = 7 ) experienced manic episodes , and 11 % ( n = 5 ) experienced hypom@@ anic episod@@ es@@ . sex , age , diagnosis ( bipolar i vs. bipolar ii ) , and additional treatment did not affect the risk of swit@@ ch@@ ing@@ . the incidence of mood switches seemed not to differ between patients receiving an anticonvulsant and those receiving no mood stabil@@ iz@@ er@@ . in contrast , mood switches were less frequent in patients receiving lithium ( 15 % , 4 / 26 ) than in patients not treated with lithium ( 44 % , 8 / 18 ; p = .04 ) . the number of previous manic episodes did not affect the probability of switching , whereas a high score on the hyper@@ thym@@ ia component of the semistructured affective temperament interview was associated with a greater risk of switching ( p = .008 ) . conclusion : the frequency of mood switching associated with acute antidepressant therapy may be reduced by lithium treat@@ ment@@ . particular attention should be paid to patients with a hyper@@ thymic temperament , who have a greater risk of mood switches .

ti@@ clop@@ idine @-@ induced cholestatic hepati@@ tis@@ . objective : to report 2 cases of ti@@ clop@@ idine @-@ induced cholestatic hepatitis , investigate its mechanism , and compare the observed main characteristics with those of the published cas@@ es@@ . case summaries : two patients developed prolonged cholestatic hepatitis after receiving ti@@ clop@@ idine following percutaneous coronary angioplasty , with complete remission during the follow @-@ up period@@ . t @-@ cell stimulation by therapeutic concentration of ti@@ clop@@ idine was demonstrated in vitro in the patients , but not in healthy contro@@ l@@ s. discussion : cholestatic hepatitis is a rare complication of the antiplatelet agent ti@@ clop@@ idine ; several cases have been reported but few in the en@@ gl@@ ish liter@@ at@@ ure@@ . our patients developed jaundice following treatment with ti@@ clop@@ idine and showed the clinical and laboratory characteristics of cholestatic hepatitis , which resolved after discontinuation of the dru@@ g. hepatitis may develop weeks after discontinuation of the drug and may run a prolonged course , but complete remission was observed in all reported cas@@ es@@ . an objective causality assessment revealed that the adverse drug event was probably related to the use of ti@@ clop@@ idine@@ . the mechanisms of this ti@@ clop@@ idine @-@ induced cholestasis are un@@ cl@@ ear@@ . immune mechanisms may be involved in the drug &apos;s hepatotoxicity , as suggested by the t @-@ cell stimulation study reported here@@ . conclusions : cholestatic hepatitis is a rare adverse effect of ti@@ clop@@ idine that may be immune medi@@ ated@@ . patients receiving the drug should be monitored with liver function tests along with complete blood cell coun@@ ts@@ . this complication will be observed even less often in the future as ti@@ clop@@ idine is being replaced by the newer antiplatelet agent clopidogrel .
epithelial sodium channel ( en@@ ac ) subunit m@@ r@@ na and protein expression in rats with puromycin amin@@ onucle@@ oside @-@ induced nephrotic syn@@ dro@@ me@@ . in experimental nephrotic syndrome , urinary sodium excretion is decreased during the early phase of the dise@@ as@@ e. the molecular mechanism ( s ) leading to salt retention has not been completely elucid@@ ated@@ . the rate @-@ limiting constituent of collecting duct sodium transport is the epithelial sodium channel ( en@@ ac ) . we examined the abundance of en@@ ac subunit m@@ r@@ n@@ as and proteins in puromycin amin@@ onucle@@ oside ( pan ) -induced nephrotic syn@@ dro@@ me@@ . the time courses of urinary sodium excretion , plasma aldosterone concentration and proteinuria were studied in male sp@@ rag@@ ue @-@ d@@ aw@@ ley rats treated with a single dose of either pan or veh@@ ic@@ le@@ . the relative amounts of alpha@@ en@@ ac , beta@@ en@@ ac and gamma@@ en@@ ac m@@ r@@ n@@ as were determined in kidneys from these rats by real @-@ time quantitative ta@@ q@@ man p@@ cr , and the amounts of proteins by western bl@@ ot@@ . the kinetics of urinary sodium excretion and the appearance of proteinuria were comparable with those reported previ@@ ous@@ ly@@ . sodium retention occurred on days 2 , 3 and 6 after pan injec@@ tion@@ . a significant up @-@ regulation of alpha@@ en@@ ac and beta@@ en@@ ac m@@ r@@ na abundance on days 1 and 2 preceded sodium retention on days 2 and 3. conversely , down @-@ regulation of alpha@@ en@@ ac , beta@@ en@@ ac and gamma@@ en@@ ac m@@ r@@ na expression on day 3 occurred in the presence of high aldosterone concentrations , and was followed by a return of sodium excretion to control valu@@ es@@ . the amounts of alpha@@ en@@ ac , beta@@ en@@ ac and gamma@@ en@@ ac proteins were not increased during pan @-@ induced sodium ret@@ enti@@ on@@ . in conclusion , en@@ ac m@@ r@@ na expression , especially alpha@@ en@@ ac , is increased in the very early phase of the experimental model of pan @-@ induced nephrotic syndrome in rats , but appears to escape from the regulation by aldosterone after day 3 .
no @-@ induced migraine attack : strong increase in plasma calcitonin gene @-@ related peptide ( c@@ gr@@ p ) concentration and negative correlation with platelet serotonin releas@@ e. the aim of the present study was to investigate changes in the plasma calcitonin gene @-@ related peptide ( c@@ gr@@ p ) concentration and platelet serotonin ( 5 @-@ hydroxy@@ trip@@ tamine , 5 @-@ h@@ t ) content during the immediate headache and the delayed genuine migraine attack provoked by nitro@@ glycer@@ in@@ . fifteen female migra@@ ine@@ urs ( without aura ) and eight controls participated in the stud@@ y@@ . sublingual nitroglycerin ( 0.5 mg ) was admini@@ stere@@ d. blood was collected from the antec@@ ub@@ ital vein four times : 60 min before and after the nitroglycerin application , and 60 and 120 min after the beginning of the migraine attack ( mean 344 and 404 min ; 12 subjects ) . in those subjects who had no migraine attack ( 11 subjects ) a similar time schedule was us@@ ed@@ . plasma c@@ gr@@ p concentration increased significantly ( p &lt; 0.01 ) during the migraine attack and returned to baseline after the cessation of the migra@@ ine@@ . in addition , both change and peak , showed significant positive correlations with migraine headache intensity ( p &lt; 0.001 ) . however , plasma c@@ gr@@ p concentrations failed to change during immediate headache and in the subjects with no migraine att@@ ack@@ . basal c@@ gr@@ p concentration was significantly higher and platelet 5 @-@ h@@ t content tended to be lower in subjects who experienced a migraine att@@ ack@@ . platelet serotonin content decreased significantly ( p &lt; 0.01 ) after nitroglycerin in subjects with no migraine attack but no consistent change was observed in patients with migraine att@@ ack@@ . in conclusion , the fact that plasma c@@ gr@@ p concentration correlates with the timing and severity of a migraine headache suggests a direct relationship between c@@ gr@@ p and migra@@ ine@@ . in contrast , serotonin release from platelets does not provoke migraine , it may even counteract the headache and the concomitant c@@ gr@@ p release in this model .

behavioral effects of uro@@ tensin @-@ ii centrally administered in mic@@ e. uro@@ tensin @-@ ii ( u @-@ ii ) receptors are widely distributed in the central nervous system@@ . intracerebroventricular ( i.c.v. ) injection of u @-@ ii causes hypertension and bradycardia and stimulates prolactin and thyrotropin secre@@ tion@@ . however , the behavioral effects of centrally administered u @-@ ii have received little att@@ enti@@ on@@ . in the present study , we tested the effects of i.c.v. injections of u @-@ ii on behavioral , metabolic , and endocrine responses in mic@@ e. administration of graded doses of u @-@ ii ( 1 @-@ 10,000 ng / mouse ) provoked : ( 1 ) a dose @-@ dependent reduction in the number of head di@@ ps in the hole @-@ board test ; ( 2 ) a dose @-@ dependent reduction in the number of entries in the white chamber in the black @-@ and @-@ white compartment test , and in the number of entries in the central platform and open arms in the plus @-@ maze test ; and ( 3 ) a dose @-@ dependent increase in the duration of immobility in the forced @-@ swimming test and tail suspension test@@ . intracerebroventricular injection of u @-@ ii also caused an increase in : food intake at doses of 100 and 1,000 ng / mouse , water intake at doses of 100 @-@ 10,000 ng / mouse , and horizontal locomotion activity at a dose of 10,000 ng / mo@@ use@@ . whatever was the dose , the central administration of u @-@ ii had no effect on body temperature , nociception , apomorphine @-@ induced penile erection and climbing behavior , and stress @-@ induced plasma corticosterone lev@@ el@@ . taken together , the present study demonstrates that the central injection of u @-@ ii at doses of 1 @-@ 10,000 ng / mouse induces anxi@@ ogen@@ ic@@ - and depressant @-@ like effects in mo@@ use@@ . these data suggest that u @-@ ii may be involved in some aspects of psychiatric disorders .

pharmacological modulation of pain @-@ related brain activity during normal and central sensitization states in human@@ s. abnormal processing of somatosensory inputs in the central nervous system ( central sensitization ) is the mechanism accounting for the enhanced pain sensitivity in the skin surrounding tissue injury ( secondary hyperalgesia ) . secondary hyperalgesia shares clinical characteristics with neurogenic hyperalgesia in patients with neuropathic pain@@ . abnormal brain responses to somatosensory stimuli have been found in patients with hyperalgesia as well as in normal subjects during experimental central sensiti@@ z@@ ation@@ . the aim of this study was to assess the effects of gabapentin , a drug effective in neuropathic pain patients , on brain processing of nociceptive information in normal and central sensitization stat@@ es@@ . using functional magnetic resonance imaging ( f@@ m@@ ri ) in normal volunteers , we studied the gabapentin @-@ induced modulation of brain activity in response to nociceptive mechanical stimulation of normal skin and capsaicin @-@ induced secondary hyper@@ alge@@ si@@ a. the dose of gabapentin was 1,@@ 800 mg per os , in a single administr@@ ation@@ . we found that ( i ) gabapentin reduced the activations in the bilateral oper@@ cul@@ oin@@ sular cortex , independently of the presence of central sensitization ; ( ii ) gabapentin reduced the activation in the brainstem , only during central sensitization ; ( iii ) gabapentin suppressed stimulus @-@ induced de@@ activations , only during central sensitization ; this effect was more robust than the effect on brain activ@@ ation@@ . the observed drug @-@ induced effects were not due to changes in the baseline f@@ m@@ ri sign@@ al@@ . these findings indicate that gabapentin has a measurable antinociceptive effect and a stronger anti@@ hyper@@ algesic effect most evident in the brain areas undergoing deactivation , thus supporting the concept that gabapentin is more effective in modulating nociceptive transmission when central sensitization is present .

mediation of enhanced reflex vagal bradycardia by l @-@ dopa via central dopamine formation in dog@@ s. l @-@ dopa ( 5 mg / kg i.v. ) decreased blood pressure and heart rate after extrac@@ erebral decarboxylase inhibition with m@@ k @-@ 486 ( 25 mg / kg i.v. ) in anesthe@@ ti@@ ze ma@@ o @-@ inhibited dog@@ s. in addition , reflex bradycardia caused by injected norepinephrine was significantly enhanced by l @-@ dopa , dl @-@ thre@@ o @-@ dihydroxy@@ phenyl@@ serine had no effect on blood pressure , heart rate or reflex responses to nore@@ pin@@ eph@@ r@@ ine@@ . fl@@ a @-@ 63 , a dopamine @-@ beta @-@ oxidase inhibitor , did not have any effect on the hypotension , bradycardia or reflex @-@ enhancing effect of l @-@ dop@@ a. pim@@ oz@@ ide did not affect the actions of l @-@ dopa on blood pressure and heart rate but completely blocked the enhancement of reflex@@ es@@ . removal of the carotid sinuses caused an elevation blood pressure and heart rate and abolished the negative chronotropic effect of nore@@ pin@@ eph@@ r@@ ine@@ . however , l @-@ dopa restored the bradycardia caused by norepinephrine in addition to decreasing blood pressure and heart rate . 5 @-@ ht@@ p ( 5 mg / kg i.v. ) decreased blood pressure and heart rate and decreased the reflex bradycardia to nore@@ pin@@ eph@@ r@@ ine@@ . it is concluded that l @-@ dopa enhances reflex bradycardia through central alpha @-@ receptor stimul@@ ation@@ . furthermore , the effects are mediated through dopamine rather than norepinephrine and do not require the carotid sinus baro@@ receptors .
cocaine @-@ induced myocardial infarction : clinical observations and pathogenetic consider@@ ation@@ s. clinical and experimental data published to date suggest several possible mechanisms by which cocaine may result in acute myocardial infarc@@ tion@@ . in individuals with preexisting , high @-@ grade coronary arterial narrowing , acute myocardial infarction may result from an increase in myocardial oxygen demand associated with cocaine @-@ induced increase in rate @-@ pressure produc@@ t. in other individuals with no underlying atherosclerotic obstruction , coronary occlusion may be due to spasm , thrombus , or bo@@ th@@ . with regard to spasm , the clinical findings are largely circumst@@ antial , and the locus of cocaine @-@ induced vasoconstriction remains spec@@ ul@@ ati@@ ve@@ . although certain clinical and experimental findings support the hypothesis that spasm involves the epicardial , medium @-@ size vessels , other data suggest intramural vasoconstric@@ tion@@ . diffuse intramural vasoconstriction is not consistent with reports of segmental , discrete infarc@@ tion@@ . whereas certain in vivo data suggest that these effects are alpha @-@ mediated , other in vitro data suggest the op@@ posit@@ e. the finding of cocaine @-@ induced vasoconstriction in segments of ( non@@ innervated ) human umbilical artery suggests that the presence or absence of intact innervation is not sufficient to explain the discrep@@ ant data involving the possibility of alpha @-@ mediated effec@@ ts@@ . finally , the contribution of a primary , thrombotic effect of cocaine has not been excluded .
rabbit syndrome , antidepressant use , and cerebral perfusion spec@@ t scan fin@@ d@@ ing@@ s. the rabbit syndrome is an extrapyramidal side effect associated with chronic neuroleptic therap@@ y@@ . its occurrence in a patient being treated with imipramine is described , representing the first reported case of this syndrome in conjunction with antidepress@@ ant@@ s. repeated cerebral perfusion spec@@ t scans revealed decreased basal ganglia perfusion while the movement disorder was present , and a return to normal perfusion when the rabbit syndrome resolved .
acute bronchodi@@ l@@ ating effects of ipr@@ atrop@@ ium bromide and theophylline in chronic obstructive pulmonary dise@@ as@@ e. the bronchodilator effects of a single dose of ipr@@ atrop@@ ium bromide aerosol ( 36 micrograms ) and short @-@ acting theophylline tablets ( dose titrated to produce serum levels of 10 @-@ 20 micrograms / ml ) were compared in a double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled crossover study in 21 patients with stable , chronic obstructive pulmonary dise@@ as@@ e. mean peak forced expiratory volume in 1 second ( f@@ ev@@ 1 ) increases over baseline and the proportion of patients attaining at least a 15 % increase in the f@@ ev@@ 1 ( responders ) were 31 % and 90 % , respectively , for ipr@@ atrop@@ ium and 17 % and 50 % , respectively , for the@@ ophyl@@ lin@@ e. the average f@@ ev@@ 1 increases during the 6 @-@ hour observation period were 18 % for ipr@@ atrop@@ ium and 8 % for the@@ ophyl@@ lin@@ e. the mean duration of action was 3.8 hours with ipr@@ atrop@@ ium and 2.4 hours with the@@ ophyl@@ lin@@ e. while side effects were rare , those experienced after theophylline use did involve the cardiovascular and gastrointestinal system@@ s. these results show that ipr@@ atrop@@ ium is a more potent bronchodilator than oral theophylline in patients with chronic airflow obstruction .
irreversible damage to the medullary interstitium in experimental analgesic nephropathy in f@@ 344 rat@@ s. renal papillary necrosis ( rp@@ n ) and a decreased urinary concentrating ability developed during continuous long @-@ term treatment with aspirin and paracetamol in female f@@ ischer 344 rat@@ s. renal structure and concentrating ability were examined after a recovery period of up to 18 weeks , when no analgesics were given , to investigate whether the analgesic @-@ induced changes were rever@@ si@@ ble@@ . there was no evidence of repair to the damaged medullary interstitial matrix , or proliferation of remaining und@@ am@@ aged type 1 medullary interstitial cells after the recovery period following analgesic treat@@ ment@@ . the recovery of urinary concentrating ability was related to the length of analgesic treatment and the extent of the resulting inner medullary structural dam@@ ag@@ e. during the early stages of analgesic treatment , the changes in urinary concentrating ability were reversible , but after prolonged analgesic treatment , maximum urinary concentrating ability failed to recover@@ . this study shows that prolonged analgesic treatment in f@@ ischer 344 rats causes progressive and irreversible damage to the interstitial matrix and type 1 interstitial cells leading to rp@@ n@@ . the associated urinary concentrating defect is reversible only during the early stages of structural damage to the inner medulla .
less frequent lithium administration and lower urine volu@@ me@@ . objective : this study was designed to determine whether patients maintained on a regimen of lithium on a once @-@ per @-@ day schedule have lower urine volumes than do patients receiving multiple doses per day@@ . method : this was a cross @-@ sectional study of 85 patients from a lithium clinic who received different dose sched@@ ul@@ es@@ . patients were admitted to the hospital for measurement of lithium level , creatinine clearance , urine volume , and maximum osmol@@ al@@ it@@ y@@ . results : multiple daily doses of lithium were associated with higher urine volum@@ es@@ . the dosing schedule , duration of lithium treatment , and daily dose of lithium did not affect maximum osmolality or creatinine cl@@ ear@@ anc@@ e. conclusions : urine volume can be reduced by giving lithium once daily and / or by lowering the total daily dos@@ e. lithium @-@ induced poly@@ uria seems to be related to extra@@ renal as well as to renal effects .
effect of adriamycin combined with whole body hyperthermia on tumor and normal tissu@@ es@@ . thermal enhancement of adriamycin @-@ mediated antitumor activity and normal tissue toxicities by whole body hyperthermia were compared using a f@@ 344 rat mod@@ el@@ . antitumor activity was studied using a tumor growth delay ass@@ ay@@ . acute normal tissue toxicities ( i.e. , leukopenia and thrombocytopenia ) and late normal tissue toxicities ( i.e. , myocardial and kidney injury ) were evaluated by functional / physiological assays and by morphological techniqu@@ es@@ . whole body hyperthermia ( 120 min at 41.5 degrees c ) enhanced both adriamycin @-@ mediated antitumor activity and toxic side effec@@ ts@@ . the thermal enhancement ratio calculated for antitumor activity was 1.6@@ . thermal enhancement ratios estimated for &quot; acute &quot; hematological changes were 1.3 , whereas those estimated for &quot; late &quot; damage ( based on morphological cardiac and renal lesions ) varied between 2.4 and 4.@@ 3. thus , while whole body hyperthermia enhances adriamycin @-@ mediated antitumor effect , normal tissue toxicity is also increased , and the potential therapeutic gain of the combined modality treatment is er@@ oded .
prazosin @-@ induced stress in@@ contin@@ enc@@ e. a case of genuine stress incontinence due to prazosin , a common antihypertensive drug , is pres@@ ente@@ d. prazosin exerts its antihypertensive effects through vasodilatation caused by selective blockade of postsynaptic alpha @-@ 1 adrenergic recep@@ tor@@ s. as an alpha @-@ blocker , it also exerts a significant relaxant effect on the bladder neck and ureth@@ ra@@ . the patient &apos;s clinical course is described and correlated with initial urodynamic studies while on prazosin and subsequent studies while taking ver@@ ap@@ amil@@ . her incontinence resolved with the change of medic@@ ation@@ . the restoration of continence was accompanied by a substantial rise in maximum urethral pressure , maximum urethral closure pressure , and functional urethral leng@@ th@@ . patients who present with stress incontinence while taking prazosin should change their antihypertensive medication before considering surgery , because their incontinence may resolve spontaneously with a change in drug therapy .
myocardial infarction following sublingual administration of isos@@ orbide din@@ itr@@ at@@ e. a 78 @-@ year @-@ old with healed septal necrosis suffered a recurrent myocardial infarction of the anterior wall following the administration of isos@@ orbide din@@ itrate 5 mg sub@@ lingu@@ all@@ y@@ . after deta@@ iling the course of events , we discuss the role of paradoxical coronary spasm and hypotension @-@ mediated myocardial ischemia occurring downstream to significant coronary arterial stenosis in the pathophysiology of acute coronary insufficiency .
fluoxetine @-@ induced ak@@ athi@@ sia : clinical and theoretical implic@@ ation@@ s. five patients receiving fluoxetine for the treatment of obsessive compulsive disorder or major depression developed ak@@ athi@@ si@@ a. the typical fluoxetine @-@ induced symptoms of rest@@ lessness , constant pacing , purpos@@ eless movements of the feet and legs , and marked anxiety were indistinguishable from those of neuroleptic @-@ induced ak@@ athi@@ si@@ a. three patients who had experienced neuroleptic @-@ induced ak@@ athi@@ sia in the past reported that the symptoms of fluoxetine @-@ induced ak@@ athi@@ sia were identical , although somewhat mil@@ der@@ . ak@@ athi@@ sia appeared to be a common side effect of fluoxetine and generally responded well to treatment with the beta @-@ adrenergic antagonist propranolol , dose reduction , or bo@@ th@@ . the authors suggest that fluoxetine @-@ induced ak@@ athi@@ sia may be caused by seroton@@ erg@@ ically mediated inhibition of dopaminergic neurotransmission and that the pathophysiology of fluoxetine @-@ induced ak@@ athi@@ sia and tricyclic antidepressant @-@ induced &quot; j@@ it@@ ter@@ iness &quot; may be identical .
chronic active hepatitis associated with diclofenac sodium therap@@ y@@ . diclofenac sodium ( volta@@ rol , ge@@ ig@@ y pharmaceuticals ) is a non @-@ steroidal anti @-@ inflammatory derivative of phenylacetic acid@@ . although generally well @-@ tolerated , asymptomatic abnormalities of liver function have been recorded and , less commonly , severe hepatitis induced by dicl@@ ofen@@ ac@@ . the patient described developed chronic active hepatitis after six months therapy with diclofenac sodium which progressed despite the withdrawal of the drug , a finding not previously reported .
stroke associated with cocaine use@@ . we describe eight patients in whom cocaine use was related to stroke and review 39 cases from the liter@@ at@@ ure@@ . among these 47 patients the mean ( + / - sd ) age was 32.5 + / - 12.1 years ; 76 % ( 34 / 45 ) were men@@ . stroke followed cocaine use by inhalation , intranasal , intravenous , and intramuscular ro@@ ut@@ es@@ . intracranial aneurysms or arteriovenous malformations were present in 17 of 32 patients studied angiographically or at autopsy ; cerebral vasculitis was present in two patient@@ s. cerebral infarction occurred in 10 patients ( 22 % ) , intracerebral hemorrhage in 22 ( 49 % ) , and subarachnoid hemorrhage in 13 ( 29 % ) . these data indicate that ( 1 ) the apparent incidence of stroke related to cocaine use is increasing ; ( 2 ) cocaine @-@ associated stroke occurs primarily in young adults ; ( 3 ) stroke may follow any route of cocaine administration ; ( 4 ) stroke after cocaine use is frequently associated with intracranial aneurysms and arteriovenous malformations ; and ( 5 ) in cocaine @-@ associated stroke , the frequency of intracranial hemorrhage exceeds that of cerebral infarction .
gly@@ bur@@ ide @-@ induced hepati@@ tis@@ . drug @-@ induced hepatotoxicity , although common , has been reported only infrequently with sulfonyl@@ ure@@ as@@ . for gly@@ bur@@ ide , a second @-@ generation sulfonylurea , only two brief reports of hepatotoxicity exist@@ . two patients with type ii diabetes mellitus developed an acute hepatitis @-@ like syndrome soon after initiation of gly@@ bur@@ ide therap@@ y@@ . there was no serologic evidence of viral infection , and a liver biopsy sample showed a histologic pattern consistent with drug @-@ induced hepati@@ tis@@ . both patients recovered quickly after stopping gly@@ bur@@ ide therapy and have remained well for a follow @-@ up period of 1 year@@ . gly@@ bur@@ ide can produce an acute hepatitis @-@ like illness in some persons .
systolic pressure variation is greater during hemorrhage than during sodium nitroprusside @-@ induced hypotension in ventilated dog@@ s. the systolic pressure variation ( sp@@ v ) , which is the difference between the maximal and minimal values of the systolic blood pressure ( s@@ bp ) after one positive @-@ pressure breath , was studied in ventilated dogs subjected to hypot@@ en@@ sion@@ . mean arterial pressure was decreased to 50 mm h@@ g for 30 minutes either by hemorrhage ( he@@ m , n = 7 ) or by continuous infusion of sodium nitroprusside ( sn@@ p , n = 7 ) . during he@@ m @-@ induced hypotension the cardiac output was significantly lower and systemic vascular resistance higher compared with that in the sn@@ p grou@@ p. the systemic , central venous , pulmonary capillary wedge pressures , and heart rates , were similar in the two grou@@ ps@@ . analysis of the respiratory changes in the arterial pressure waveform enabled differentiation between the two grou@@ ps@@ . the sp@@ v during hypotension was 15.7 + / - 6.7 mm h@@ g in the he@@ m group , compared with 9.1 + / - 2.0 mm h@@ g in the sn@@ p group ( p less than 0.02 ) . the delta down , which is the measure of decrease of s@@ bp after a mechanical breath , was 20.3 + / - 8.4 and 10.1 + / - 3.8 mm h@@ g in the he@@ m and sn@@ p groups , respectively , during hypotension ( p less than 0.02 ) . it is concluded that increases in the sp@@ v and the delta down are characteristic of a hypotensive state due to a predominant decrease in pre@@ load@@ . they are thus more important during absolute hypovol@@ emia than during deliberate hypotension .
drug @-@ induced arterial spasm relieved by lid@@ oc@@ ain@@ e. case repor@@ t. following major intracranial surgery in a 35 @-@ year @-@ old man , sodium pent@@ oth@@ al was intravenously infused to minimize cerebral isch@@ aem@@ i@@ a. intense vasospasm with threatened gangrene arose in the arm used for the infu@@ sion@@ . since the cranial condition precluded use of more usual methods , lidocaine was given intra @-@ arter@@ ially , with careful cardiovascular monitoring , to counteract the vas@@ osp@@ as@@ m. the treatment was rapidly successful .
cerebral blood flow and metabolism during isoflurane @-@ induced hypotension in patients subjected to surgery for cerebral aneurys@@ m@@ s. cerebral blood flow and cerebral metabolic rate for oxygen were measured during isoflurane @-@ induced hypotension in 10 patients subjected to craniotomy for clipping of a cerebral aneurys@@ m. flow and metabolism were measured 5 @-@ 13 days after the subarachnoid haemorrhage by a modification of the classical k@@ ety @-@ sch@@ mid@@ t technique using xenon @-@ 133 i.v. anaesthesia was maintained with an inspired isoflurane concentration of 0.75 % ( plus 67 % nitrous oxide in oxygen ) , during which c@@ b@@ f and cm@@ ro@@ 2 were 34.3 + / - 2.1 ml / 100 g min @-@ 1 and 2.32 + / - 0.16 ml / 100 g min @-@ 1 at pac@@ o@@ 2 4.1 + / - 0.1 k@@ pa ( mean + / - se@@ m ) . controlled hypotension to an average map of 50 @-@ 55 mm h@@ g was induced by increasing the dose of isoflurane , and maintained at an inspired concentration of 2.2 + / - 0.2 % . this resulted in a significant decrease in cm@@ ro@@ 2 ( to 1.73 + / - 0.16 ml / 100 g min @-@ 1 ) , while c@@ b@@ f was un@@ chang@@ ed@@ . after the clipping of the aneurysm the isoflurane concentration was reduced to 0.75 % . there was a significant increase in c@@ b@@ f , although cm@@ ro@@ 2 was unchanged , compared with pre @-@ hypotensive valu@@ es@@ . these changes might offer protection to brain tissue during periods of induced hypotension .
allergic reaction to 5 @-@ fluorouracil infu@@ sion@@ . an allergic reaction consisting of angi@@ oneuro@@ tic edema secondary to continuous infusion 5 @-@ fluorouracil occurred in a patient with recurrent carcinoma of the oral cavity , cirrhosis , and cisplatin @-@ induced impaired renal function@@ . this reaction occurred during the sixth and seventh courses of infu@@ sional chemo@@ therap@@ y@@ . oral di@@ phen@@ hydr@@ amine and prednisone were ineffective in preventing the recurrence of the allergic re@@ action@@ . discontinu@@ ance of effective chemotherapy in this patient during partial remission resulted in fatal disease progression .
amiodarone @-@ induced sin@@ oatrial bloc@@ k@@ . we observed sin@@ oatrial block due to chronic amiodarone administration in a 5 @-@ year @-@ old boy with primary cardiomyopathy , wol@@ ff @-@ parkin@@ son @-@ white syndrome and supraventricular tachycardi@@ a. reduction in the dosage of amiodarone resulted in the disappearance of the sin@@ oatrial block and the persistence of asymptomatic sinus bradycardia .
possible terat@@ ogenicity of sulph@@ as@@ al@@ az@@ ine@@ . three infants , born of two mothers with inflammatory bowel disease who received treatment with sulph@@ asalazine throughout pregnancy , were found to have major congenital anomal@@ i@@ es@@ . in the singleton pregnancy , the mother had ulcerative colitis , and the infant , a male , had coarctation of the aorta and a ventricular septal defec@@ t. in the twin pregnancy , the mother had cro@@ hn &apos;s dise@@ as@@ e. the first twin , a female , had a left pot@@ ter @-@ type i@@ ia polycystic kidney and a rudi@@ mentary left uterine cor@@ nu@@ . the second twin , a male , had some features of pot@@ ter &apos;s fac@@ ies , hypoplastic lungs , absent kidneys and ureters , and tal@@ ip@@ es equ@@ in@@ ov@@ ar@@ us@@ . despite reports to the contrary , it is suggested that sulph@@ asalazine may be teratogenic .
veno @-@ occlusive liver disease after dac@@ arb@@ azine therapy ( d@@ tic ) for melan@@ om@@ a. a case of veno @-@ occlusive disease of the liver with fatal outcome after dac@@ arb@@ azine ( d@@ tic ) therapy for melanoma is repor@@ te@@ d. there was a fulminant clinical course from start of symptoms until de@@ ath@@ . at autopsy the liver was enlarged and firm with signs of venous cong@@ estion@@ . small@@ - and medium @-@ sized hepatic veins were blocked by thrombo@@ si@@ s. eosinophilic infiltr@@ ations were found around the v@@ ess@@ el@@ s. published cases from the literature are reviewed and pertinent features discussed .
a case of tardive dyskinesia caused by met@@ ocl@@ op@@ ram@@ ide@@ . abnormal involuntary movements appeared in the mouth , tongue , neck and abdomen of a 64 @-@ year @-@ old male patient after he took metoclopramide for gastrointestinal disorder in a regimen of 30 mg per day for a total of about 260 day@@ s. the symptoms exacerbated to a maximum in a mon@@ th@@ . when the metoclopramide administration was discontinued , the abnormal movements gradually improved to a considerable ex@@ tent@@ . attention to the possible induction of specific tardive dyskinesia is called for in the use of this drug .
further observations on the electrophysiologic effects of oral amiodarone therap@@ y@@ . a case is presented of a reversible intra @-@ hi@@ sian block occurring under amiodarone treatment for atrial tachycardia in a patient without clear intraventricular conduction abnormal@@ iti@@ es@@ . his bundle recordings showed an atrial tachycardia with intermittent exit block and greatly prolonged b@@ h and h@@ v intervals ( 40 and 100 msec , respectively ) . thirty days after amiodarone discontinuation , his bundle electro@@ grams showed atrial flutter without intra @-@ hi@@ sian or inf@@ ra @-@ hi@@ sian del@@ ay@@ . amiodarone should be used with caution during long @-@ term oral therapy in patients with or without clear intraventricular conduction defects .
bus@@ ulfan @-@ induced hemorrhagic cy@@ sti@@ tis@@ . a case of a bus@@ ulfan @-@ induced hemorrhage cystitis is repor@@ te@@ d. spontaneous resolution occurred following cessation of the dru@@ g. the similarity between the histologic appearances of bus@@ ulfan cystitis and both radiation and cyclophosphamide @-@ induced cystitis is discussed and the world literature revie@@ wed@@ . in view of the known tendency of bus@@ ulfan to induce cellular atypia and carcinoma in other sites , periodic urinary cytology is suggested in patients on long @-@ term therapy .
rebound hypertensive after sodium nitroprusside prevented by sar@@ al@@ asin in rat@@ s. the role of the ren@@ in@@ --@@ angiotensin system in the maintenance of blood pressure during halothane anesthesia and sodium nitroprusside ( sn@@ p ) -induced hypotension was evalu@@ ated@@ . control rats received halothane anesthesia ( 1 ma@@ c ) for one hour , followed by sn@@ p infusion , 40 microgram / kg / min , for 30 min , followed by a 30 @-@ min recovery period@@ . a second group of rats was treated iden@@ tically and , in addition , received an infusion of sar@@ al@@ asin ( a competitive inhibitor of angiotensin ii ) throughout the experimental period@@ . in each group , sn@@ p infusion resulted in an initial decrease in blood pressure from 86 tor@@ r and 83 tor@@ r , respectively , to 48 tor@@ r@@ . during the sn@@ p infusion the control animals demonstrated a progressive increase in blood pressure to 61 tor@@ r , whereas the sar@@ al@@ asin @-@ treated animals showed no chang@@ e. following discontinuation of sn@@ p , blood pressure in the control animals re@@ bounded to 94 tor@@ r , as compared with 78 tor@@ r in the sar@@ al@@ asin @-@ treated rat@@ s. this study indicates that with stable halothane anesthesia , the partial recovery of blood pressure during sn@@ p infusion and the post @-@ sn@@ p rebound of blood pressure can be completely blocked by sar@@ al@@ as@@ in@@ . this demonstrates the participation of the ren@@ in@@ --@@ angiotensin system in antagon@@ izing the combined hypotensive effects of halothane and sn@@ p .
toxic hepatitis induced by anti@@ thyroid drugs : four cases including one with cross @-@ reactivity between carb@@ im@@ azole and benzyl@@ thiour@@ ac@@ il@@ . objective : this study was conducted to assess the occurrence of hepatic adverse effects encountered with anti@@ thyroid dru@@ g@@ s. methods : retrospective review of medical records of 236 patients with hyperthyroidism admitted in our department ( in- or out @-@ patients ) from 1986 to 199@@ 2. results : four patients ( 1.7 % ) were identified with toxic hepatitis which could reasonably be attributed to the use of anti@@ thyroid ag@@ ent@@ . two patients had a cholestatic hepatitis induced by carb@@ im@@ azole ( n omer@@ ca@@ zole ) . two others had a mixed ( cholestatic and cytolytic ) hepatitis following carb@@ im@@ azol@@ e. one of the latter two patients further experienced a cytolytic hepatitis which appeared after benzyl@@ thiour@@ acil ( bas@@ d ne ) had replaced carb@@ im@@ azol@@ e. biological features of hepatitis disappeared in all cases after cessation of the in@@ crim@@ inated drug , while biliary , viral and immunological searches were neg@@ ati@@ ve@@ . only 2 patients of our retrospective study experienced a mild or severe neutrop@@ eni@@ a. conclusion : toxic hepatitis is a potential adverse effect of anti@@ thyroid drugs which warrants , as for haematological disturbances , a pre @-@ therapeutic determination and a careful follow @-@ up of relevant biological mark@@ er@@ s. moreover , hepatotoxicity may not be restricted to one class of anti@@ thyroid agents .
study of the role of vitamin b@@ 12 and fol@@ inic acid supplementation in preventing hematologic toxicity of z@@ idov@@ ud@@ ine@@ . a prospective , randomized study was conducted to evaluate the role of vitamin b@@ 12 and fol@@ inic acid supplementation in preventing zidovudine ( z@@ d@@ v ) -induced bone marrow sup@@ pres@@ sion@@ . seventy @-@ five human immunodeficiency virus ( hi@@ v ) -infected patients with cd@@ 4 + cell counts &lt; 500 / mm3 were randomized to receive either z@@ d@@ v ( 500 mg daily ) alone ( group i , n = 38 ) or in combination with fol@@ inic acid ( 15 mg daily ) and intram@@ ascular vitamin b@@ 12 ( 1000 micrograms monthly ) ( group ii , n = 37 ) . finally , 15 patients were excluded from the study ( non@@ compliance 14 , death 1 ) ; thus , 60 patients ( 31 in group i and 29 in group ii ) were eligible for analy@@ si@@ s. no significant differences between groups were found at enroll@@ ment@@ . during the study , vitamin b@@ 12 and folate levels were significantly higher in group ii patients ; however , no differences in hemoglobin , hematocrit , mean corpuscular volume , and white @-@ cell , neutrophil and platelet counts were observed between groups at 3 , 6 , 9 and 12 mon@@ th@@ s. severe hematologic toxicity ( neutrophil count &lt; 1000 / mm3 and / or hemoglobin &lt; 8 g / dl ) occurred in 4 patients assigned to group i and 7 assigned to group i@@ i. there was no correlation between vitamin b@@ 12 or folate levels and development of myel@@ osup@@ pres@@ sion@@ . vitamin b@@ 12 and fol@@ inic acid supplementation of z@@ d@@ v therapy does not seem useful in preventing or reducing z@@ d@@ v @-@ induced myel@@ otoxicity in the overall treated population , although a beneficial effect in certain subgroups of patients cannot be excluded .
acute confusion induced by a high @-@ dose infusion of 5 @-@ fluorouracil and fol@@ inic acid@@ . a 61 @-@ year @-@ old man was treated with combination chemotherapy incorporating cis@@ platinum , etoposide , high @-@ dose 5 @-@ fluorouracil ( 2,@@ 250 mg / m2 / 24 hours ) and fol@@ inic acid for an inoperable gastric aden@@ ocarcin@@ om@@ a. he developed acute neurologic symptoms of mental confusion , dis@@ orientation and irritability , and then lap@@ sed into a deep coma , lasting for approximately 40 hours during the first dose ( day 2 ) of 5 @-@ fluorouracil and fol@@ inic acid infu@@ sion@@ . this complication re@@ appeared on day 25 during the second dose of 5 @-@ fluorouracil and fol@@ inic acid , which were then the only drugs gi@@ ven@@ . because fol@@ inic acid was unlikely to be associated with this condition , neurotoxicity due to high @-@ dose 5 @-@ fluorouracil was highly suspec@@ te@@ d. the pathogenesis of 5 @-@ fluorouracil neurotoxicity may be due to a k@@ re@@ bs cycle blockade by fluoro@@ acetate and fluoro@@ citrate , thiamine deficiency , or dihydro@@ uracil dehydrogenase defici@@ enc@@ y@@ . high @-@ dose 5 @-@ fluorouracil / fol@@ inic acid infusion therapy has recently become a popular regimen for various cancer@@ s. it is necessary that both oncologists and neurologists be fully aware of this unusual complication .
effect of switching carbamazepine to ox@@ carb@@ azepine on the plasma levels of neurolep@@ tic@@ s. a case repor@@ t. carbamazepine was switched to its 10 @-@ keto analogue ox@@ carb@@ azepine among six difficult @-@ to @-@ treat schizophrenic or organic psychotic patients using concomitantly haloperidol , chlorpromazine or cloz@@ ap@@ ine@@ . this change resulted within 2 @-@ 4 weeks in the 50 @-@ 200 % increase in the plasma levels of these neuroleptics and the appearance of extrapyramidal symptom@@ s. none of the patients showed any clinical deteri@@ otation during the following 3 @-@ 6 mon@@ th@@ s. the results of this case report support the idea that in contrast with carbamazepine ox@@ carb@@ azepine does not induce the hepatic microsomal enzyme systems regulating the inactivation of antipsychotic drugs .
erythema multiforme and hypersensitivity myocarditis caused by amp@@ icil@@ lin@@ . objective : to report a case of erythema multiforme and hypersensitivity myocarditis caused by amp@@ icil@@ lin@@ . case summary : a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy was treated with ampicillin and gentamicin because of suspected septic@@ em@@ i@@ a. medications were discontinued when erythema multiforme and congestive heart failure caused by myocarditis occur@@ red@@ . the patient was treated with methylprednisolone and gradually impro@@ ve@@ d. macrophage @-@ migration inhibition ( mi@@ f ) test with ampicillin was posi@@ ti@@ ve@@ . discussion : after most infections causing erythema multiforme and myocarditis were ruled out , a drug @-@ induced allergic reaction was suspec@@ te@@ d. positive mi@@ f test for ampicillin showed sensitization of the patient &apos;s lymphocytes to amp@@ icil@@ lin@@ . conclusions : hypersensitivity myocarditis is a rare and dangerous manifestation of allergy to penicil@@ lins .
immediate allergic reactions to amox@@ icil@@ lin@@ . a large group of patients with suspected allergic reactions to beta @-@ lactam antibiotics was evalu@@ ated@@ . a detailed clinical history , together with skin tests , r@@ ast ( radio@@ allerg@@ os@@ orbent test ) , and controlled challenge tests , was used to establish whether patients allergic to beta @-@ lactam antibiotics had selective immediate allergic responses to amoxicillin ( ax ) or were cross @-@ reacting with other penicillin deriv@@ ati@@ v@@ es@@ . skin tests were performed with benzyl@@ pen@@ ic@@ illo@@ yl @-@ poly @-@ l @-@ lysine ( b@@ po @-@ pl@@ l ) , benzyl@@ pen@@ ic@@ illo@@ ate , benzyl@@ penicillin ( pg ) , ampicillin ( amp ) , and ax@@ . r@@ ast for b@@ po @-@ pl@@ l and ax @-@ pl@@ l was don@@ e. when both skin test and r@@ ast for b@@ po were negative , single @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled challenge tests were done to ensure tolerance of pg or sensitivity to ax@@ . a total of 177 patients were diagnosed as allergic to beta @-@ lactam antibio@@ tic@@ s. we selected the 54 ( 30.5 % ) cases of immediate ax allergy with good tolerance of p@@ g. anaphylaxis was seen in 37 patients ( 69 % ) , the other 17 ( 31 % ) having urticaria and / or angio@@ ede@@ ma@@ . all the patients were skin test negative to b@@ po ; 49 of 51 ( 96 % ) were also negative to md@@ m , and 44 of 46 ( 96 % ) to p@@ g. skin tests with ax were positive in 34 ( 63 % ) patient@@ s. r@@ ast was positive for ax in 22 patients ( 41 % ) and to b@@ po in just 5 ( 9 % ) . none of the sera with negative r@@ ast for ax were positive to b@@ po@@ . challenge tests with ax were performed in 23 subjects ( 43 % ) to establish the diagnosis of immediate allergic reaction to ax , and in 15 cases ( 28 % ) both skin test and r@@ ast for ax were neg@@ ati@@ ve@@ . pg was well tolerated by all 54 patient@@ s. we describe the largest group of ax @-@ allergic patients who have tolerated pg reported so far@@ . diagnosis of these patients can be achieved only if specific ax @-@ related reagents are employ@@ ed@@ . further studies are necessary to determine the exact extent of this problem and to improve the efficacy of diagnostic methods .
persistent paralysis after prolonged use of atrac@@ urium in the absence of cortico@@ steroid@@ s. neuromuscular blocking agents ( nm@@ b@@ as ) are often used for patients requiring prolonged mechanical ventil@@ ation@@ . reports of persistent paralysis after the discontinu@@ ance of these drugs have most often involved amino@@ steroid @-@ based nm@@ b@@ as such as vecuronium bromide , especially when used in conjunction with cortico@@ steroid@@ s. atrac@@ urium bes@@ ylate , a short @-@ acting benzyl@@ iso@@ quinol@@ inium nm@@ ba that is eliminated independently of renal or hepatic function , has also been associated with persistent paralysis , but only when used with cortico@@ steroid@@ s. we report a case of atrac@@ urium @-@ related paralysis persisting for approximately 50 hours in a patient who was not treated with corticosteroids .
habitual use of acetaminophen as a risk factor for chronic renal failure : a comparison with phen@@ ace@@ tin@@ . six epidemiologic studies in the un@@ ited states and euro@@ pe indicate that habitual use of phen@@ ace@@ tin is associated with the development of chronic renal failure and end @-@ stage renal disease ( es@@ rd ) , with a relative risk in the range of 4 to 19@@ . as a result of these and other studies , phen@@ ace@@ tin has now been withdrawn from the market in most coun@@ tri@@ es@@ . however , three case control studies , one each in north caro@@ lina , northern mar@@ yland , and west ber@@ lin , ger@@ many , showed that habitual use of acetaminophen is also associated with chronic renal failure and es@@ rd , with a relative risk in the range of 2 to 4@@ . these studies suggest that both phen@@ ace@@ tin and acetaminophen may contribute to the burden of es@@ rd , with the risk of the latter being somewhat less than that of the form@@ er@@ . this apparent difference in risk may not be due to differences in nephrotoxic potential of the drugs them@@ sel@@ v@@ es@@ . a lower relative risk would be expected for acetaminophen if the risk of both drugs in combination with other analgesics was higher than the risk of either agent al@@ on@@ e. thus , acetaminophen has been used both as a single agent and in combination with other analgesics , whereas phen@@ ace@@ tin was available only in combin@@ ation@@ s. the possibility that habitual use of acetaminophen alone increases the risk of es@@ rd has not been clearly demonstrated , but cannot be dis@@ missed .
reduction of heparan sulphate @-@ associated anionic sites in the glomerular basement membrane of rats with streptozotocin @-@ induced diabetic nephro@@ path@@ y@@ . heparan sulphate @-@ associated anionic sites in the glomerular basement membrane were studied in rats 8 months after induction of diabetes by streptozotocin and in age- ad@@ n sex @-@ matched control rats , employing the cationic dye cu@@ pro@@ linic blu@@ e. morphometric analysis at the ultrastructural level was performed using a computerized image process@@ or@@ . the heparan sulphate specificity of the cu@@ pro@@ linic blue staining was demonstrated by glycosaminoglycan @-@ degrading enzymes , showing that pretreatment of the sections with hep@@ ari@@ tinase abolished all staining , whereas chondro@@ itin@@ ase ab@@ c had no effec@@ t. the majority of anionic sites ( 74 % in diabetic and 81 % in control rats ) were found within the lamina r@@ ara extern@@ a of the glomerular basement membran@@ e. a minority of anionic sites were scattered throughout the lamina den@@ sa and lamina r@@ ara intern@@ a , and were significantly smaller than those in the lamina r@@ ara extern@@ a of the glomerular basement membrane ( p &lt; 0.001 and p &lt; 0.01 for diabetic and control rats , respectively ) . diabetic rats progressively developed albuminuria reaching 4@@ 0.3 ( 32.2 @-@ 6@@ 2.0 ) mg / 24 h after 8 months in contrast to the control animals ( 0.8 ( 0.2 @-@ 0.9 ) mg / 24 h , p &lt; 0.002 ) . at the same time , the number of heparan sulphate anionic sites and the total anionic site surface ( number of anionic sites x mean anionic site surface ) in the lamina r@@ ara extern@@ a of the glomerular basement membrane was reduced by 19 % ( p &lt; 0.021 ) and by 26 % ( p &lt; 0.02 ) , respec@@ ti@@ vel@@ y@@ . number and total anionic site surface in the remaining part of the glomerular basement membrane ( lamina den@@ sa and lamina r@@ ara intern@@ a ) were not significantly chang@@ ed@@ . we conclude that in streptozotocin @-@ diabetic rats with an increased urinary albumin excretion , a reduced heparan sulphate charge barrier / density is found at the lamina r@@ ara extern@@ a of the glomerular basement membrane .

lithium @-@ associated cognitive and functional deficits reduced by a switch to di@@ valpro@@ ex sodium : a case ser@@ i@@ es@@ . background : lithium remains a first @-@ line treatment for the acute and maintenance treatment of bipolar dis@@ or@@ der@@ . although much has been written about the management of the more common adverse effects of lithium , such as poly@@ uria and tremor , more subtle lithium side effects such as cognitive deficits , loss of creativity , and functional impairments remain under@@ studi@@ ed@@ . this report summarizes our experience in switching bipolar patients from lithium to di@@ valpro@@ ex sodium to alleviate such cognitive and functional impair@@ ment@@ s. method : open , case series design@@ . results : we report seven cases where substitution of lithium , either fully or partially , with di@@ valpro@@ ex sodium was extremely helpful in reducing the cognitive , motivational , or creative deficits attributed to lithium in our bipolar patient@@ s. conclusion : in this preliminary report , di@@ valpro@@ ex sodium was a superior alternative to lithium in bipolar patients experiencing cognitive deficits , loss of creativity , and functional impairments .
treatment of previously treated metastatic breast cancer by mitoxantrone and 48 @-@ hour continuous infusion of high @-@ dose 5 @-@ f@@ u and leucovorin ( m@@ fl ) : low palliative benefit and high treatment @-@ related toxic@@ it@@ y@@ . for previously treated advanced breast cancer , there is no standard second @-@ line therap@@ y@@ . combination chemotherapy with mitoxantrone , high @-@ dose 5 @-@ fluorouracil ( 5 @-@ f@@ u ) and leucovorin ( m@@ fl regimen ) had been reported as an effective and well tolerated reg@@ im@@ en@@ . from oc@@ tober 1993 to nov@@ ember 1995 , we treated 13 patients with previously chemotherapy @-@ treated metastatic breast cancer by mitoxantrone , 12 mg / m2 , on day 1 and continuous infusion of 5 @-@ f@@ u , 3000 mg / m2 , together with leucovorin , 300 mg / m2 , for 48 h from day 1 to 2. each course of chemotherapy was given every 4 week@@ s. most of these patients had more than two metastatic sites , with lung metastasis predomin@@ ant@@ . seven patients had been treated with anthrac@@ y@@ clin@@ e. seven patients had previously received radiotherapy and seven had received hormone therap@@ y@@ . median number of courses of m@@ fl regimen given was six and the median cumulative dose of mitoxantrone was 68.@@ 35 mg / m@@ 2. one patient had complete response , seven had stable disease , none had partial response and five had progressive dise@@ as@@ e. the overall objective response rate was 7.6 % . the median follow @-@ up period was 14 mon@@ th@@ s. median survival was 16 mon@@ th@@ s. median progression @-@ free survival was 5 mon@@ th@@ s. a complete responder had relapse @-@ free survival up to 17 mon@@ th@@ s. major toxicities were cardiotoxicity and leuk@@ open@@ i@@ a. eight patients were dead in the last follow @-@ up ; two of them died of treatment @-@ related toxic@@ it@@ y@@ . the m@@ fl regimen achieves little palliative benefit and induces severe toxicity at a fairly high rat@@ e. administration of this regimen to breast cancer patients who have been treated by chemotherapy and those with impaired heart function requires careful attention .
upregulation of the expression of vasopressin gene in the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei of the lithium @-@ induced diabetes insipidus rat@@ . the expression of arginine vasopressin ( av@@ p ) gene in the paraventricular ( p@@ v@@ n ) and supraoptic nuclei ( son ) was investigated in rats with lithium ( li ) -induced poly@@ uria , using in situ hybridization histochemistry and radio@@ immuno@@ ass@@ ay@@ . the male w@@ istar rats consuming a diet that contained lic@@ l ( 60 mmol / kg ) for 4 weeks developed marked poly@@ ur@@ i@@ a. the li @-@ treated rats produced a large volume of hypotonic urine with low ionic concentr@@ ation@@ s. plasma sodium concentrations were found to be slightly increased in the li @-@ treated rats compared with those in contro@@ l@@ s. plasma concentration of av@@ p and transcripts of av@@ p gene in the p@@ v@@ n and son were significantly increased in the li @-@ treated rats compared with contro@@ l@@ s. these results suggest that dehydration and / or the activation of visceral afferent inputs may contribute to the elevation of plasma av@@ p and the upregulation of av@@ p gene expression in the p@@ v@@ n and the son of the li @-@ induced diabetes insipidus rat .
su@@ x@@ am@@ ethonium @-@ induced cardiac arrest and death following 5 days of immobil@@ iz@@ ation@@ . the present report describes a case of cardiac arrest and subsequent death as a result of hyper@@ kal@@ aemia following the use of su@@ x@@ am@@ ethonium in a 23 @-@ year @-@ old mal@@ aw@@ ian wom@@ an@@ . five days after the onset of the symptoms of meningitis , the patient aspirated stomach contents and needed endotracheal intub@@ ation@@ . forty seconds after injection of su@@ x@@ am@@ ethonium , bradycardia and cardiac arrest occur@@ red@@ . attempts to resuscit@@ ate the patient were not success@@ ful@@ . the serum level of potassium was observed to be 8.4 me@@ qui@@ v l @-@ 1@@ . apart from the reduction in the patient &apos;s level of consciousness , there were no signs of motor neur@@ one damage or of any of the other known predisposing conditions for hyper@@ kal@@ aemia following the administration of su@@ x@@ am@@ eth@@ oni@@ um@@ . it is postulated that her death was caused by hypersensitivity to su@@ x@@ am@@ ethonium , associated with her 5 @-@ day immobilization .

clinical and histopathologic examination of renal allografts treated with tacrolimus ( f@@ k@@ 506 ) for at least one year@@ . background : we clinically and pathologically analyzed renal allografts from 1 9 renal transplant patients treated with tacrolimus ( f@@ k@@ 506 ) for more than 1 year@@ . methods : twenty @-@ six renal allograft biopsy specimens from 1 9 renal transplant patients who underwent transplantations between 1991 and 1993 were evalu@@ ated@@ . thirteen biopsies were performed from stable functioning renal allografts with informed consent ( non@@ episode biopsy ) and the other 13 were from dysfunctional renal allografts with a clinical indication for biopsy ( episode biopsy ) . results : the main pathologic diagnoses ( some overlap ) were acute rejection ( ar ; n = 4 ) , chronic rejection ( cr ; n = 5 ) , ar + cr ( n = 4 ) , recurrent ig@@ a nephropathy ( n = 5 ) , normal findings ( n = 2 ) , minimal @-@ type chronic f@@ k@@ 506 nephropathy ( n = 9 ) , and mild @-@ type f@@ k@@ 506 nephropathy ( n = 11 ) . of the non@@ episode biopsies , 7 and 4 biopsies showed minimal @-@ type and mild @-@ type chronic f@@ k@@ 506 nephropathy , respec@@ ti@@ vel@@ y@@ . chronic f@@ k@@ 506 nephropathy consisted of rough and fo@@ amy tubular vacuol@@ ization ( 5 biopsies ) , arteri@@ ol@@ opathy ( angio@@ degeneration of the arteriolar wall ; 20 biopsies ) , focal segmental glomerulosclerosis ( 4 biopsies ) and the strip@@ ed form of interstitial fibrosis ( 11 biopsies ) . the serum creatinine levels of patients in the mild @-@ type chronic f@@ k@@ 506 nephropathy group , which included 7 episode biopsies , were statistically higher than those in the minimum @-@ type chronic f@@ k@@ 506 @-@ nephropathy group ( p &lt; 0.001 ) . conclusions : this study demonstrates that chronic f@@ k@@ 506 nephropathy consists primarily of arteri@@ ol@@ opathy manifesting as in@@ sud@@ ative hyal@@ in@@ osis of the arteriolar wall , and suggests that mild @-@ type chronic f@@ k@@ 506 nephropathy is a condition which may lead to deterioration of renal allograft function .
memory facilitation and stimulation of endogenous nerve growth factor synthesis by the acetylcholine releas@@ er pg @-@ 9@@ . the effects of pg @-@ 9 ( 3alpha @-@ trop@@ yl 2- ( p @-@ bromo@@ phenyl ) propionate ) , the acetylcholine releas@@ er , on memory processes and nerve growth factor ( n@@ g@@ f ) synthesis were evalu@@ ated@@ . in the mouse passive @-@ avoidance test , pg @-@ 9 ( 10 @-@ 30 mg / kg , i.p. ) , administered 20 min before the training session , prevented amnesia induced by both the non selective antim@@ us@@ carinic drug scopolamine and the m1 @-@ selective antagonist s- ( - ) -@@ et @-@ 126@@ . in the same experimental conditions , pg @-@ 9 ( 5 @-@ 20 microg per mouse , i.c.v. ) was also able to prevent antim@@ us@@ car@@ ine @-@ induced amnesia , demonstrating a central localization of the activ@@ it@@ y@@ . at the highest effective doses , pg @-@ 9 did not produce any collateral symptoms as revealed by the ir@@ win test , and it did not modify spontaneous motility and inspection activity , as revealed by the hole @-@ board test@@ . pg @-@ 9 was also able to increase the amount of n@@ g@@ f secreted in vitro by astrocytes in a dose @-@ dependent man@@ ner@@ . the maximal n@@ g@@ f contents obtained by pg @-@ 9 were 17.6 @-@ fold of the control valu@@ e. during culture , no morphological changes were found at effective concentrations of pg @-@ 9@@ . the current work indicates the ability of pg @-@ 9 to induce beneficial effects on cognitive processes and stimulate activity of n@@ g@@ f synthesis in astroglial cell@@ s. therefore , pg @-@ 9 could represent a potential useful drug able to improve the function of impaired cognitive processes .

recurrent use of newer oral contraceptives and the risk of venous thrombo@@ embol@@ is@@ m. the epidemiological studies that assessed the risk of venous thromboembolism ( v@@ te ) associated with newer oral contraceptives ( oc ) did not distinguish between patterns of oc use , namely first @-@ time users , repeat@@ ers and swit@@ ch@@ er@@ s. data from a trans@@ national case @-@ control study were used to assess the risk of v@@ te for the latter patterns of use , while accounting for duration of use@@ . over the period 1993 @-@ 1996 , 551 cases of v@@ te were identified in ger@@ many and the u@@ k along with 20@@ 66 contro@@ l@@ s. tot@@ als of 128 cases and 650 controls were analysed for repeat use and 135 cases and 6@@ 22 controls for switching pattern@@ s. the adjusted rate ratio of v@@ te for repeat users of third generation oc was 0.6 ( 95 % ci : 0.3 @-@ 1.2 ) relative to repeat users of second generation pills , whereas it was 1.3 ( 95 % ci : 0.7 @-@ 2.4 ) for swit@@ chers from second to third generation pills relative to swit@@ chers from third to second generation pill@@ s. we conclude that second and third generation agents are associated with equivalent risks of v@@ te when the same agent is used repeatedly after interruption periods or when users are switched between the two generations of pill@@ s. these analyses suggest that the higher risk observed for the newer oc in other studies may be the result of inadequate comparisons of pill users with different patterns of pill use .

the relationship between hippocampal acetylcholine release and cholinergic convulsant sensitivity in withdrawal seizure @-@ prone and withdrawal seizure @-@ resistant selected mouse lin@@ es@@ . background : the sep@@ to @-@ hippocampal cholinergic pathway has been implicated in epilept@@ ogenesis , and genetic factors influence the response to cholinergic agents , but limited data are available on cholinergic involvement in alcohol withdrawal sever@@ it@@ y@@ . thus , the relationship between cholinergic activity and responsiveness and alcohol withdrawal was investigated in a genetic animal model of ethanol withdrawal sever@@ it@@ y@@ . methods : cholinergic convulsant sensitivity was examined in alcohol @-@ na ve withdrawal seizure @-@ prone ( w@@ sp ) and @-@ resistant ( w@@ s@@ r ) mic@@ e. animals were administered nicotine , carbachol , or neostigmine via timed tail vein infusion , and the latencies to onset of tremor and clon@@ us were recorded and converted to threshold dos@@ e. we also used microdialysis to measure basal and potassium @-@ stimulated acetylcholine ( ach ) release in the ca@@ 1 region of the hippocamp@@ us@@ . potassium was applied by reverse dialysis twice , separated by 75 min@@ . hippocampal ach also was measured during testing for handling @-@ induced convul@@ sion@@ s. results : sensitivity to several convul@@ sion endpoints induced by nicotine , carbachol , and neostigmine were significantly greater in w@@ s@@ r versus w@@ sp mic@@ e. in microdialysis experiments , the lines did not differ in basal release of ach , and 50 mm k@@ cl increased ach output in both lines of mic@@ e. however , the increase in release of ach produced by the first application of k@@ cl was 2 @-@ fold higher in w@@ sp versus w@@ s@@ r mic@@ e. when hippocampal ach was measured during testing for handling @-@ induced convulsions , extracellular ach was significantly elevated ( 192 % ) in w@@ sp mice , but was non@@ significantly elevated ( 59 % ) in w@@ s@@ r mic@@ e. conclusions : these results suggest that differences in cholinergic activity and postsynaptic sensitivity to cholinergic convuls@@ ants may be associated with ethanol withdrawal severity and implicate cholinergic mechanisms in alcohol withdraw@@ al@@ . specifically , w@@ sp mice may have lower sensitivity to cholinergic convuls@@ ants compared with w@@ s@@ r because of postsynaptic receptor desensitization brought on by higher activity of cholinergic neurons .
prenatal dexamethasone programs hypertension and renal injury in the rat@@ . dexamethasone is frequently administered to the developing fetus to accelerate pulmonary develop@@ ment@@ . the purpose of the present study was to determine if prenatal dexamethasone programmed a progressive increase in blood pressure and renal injury in rat@@ s. pregnant rats were given either vehicle or 2 daily intraperitoneal injections of dexamethasone ( 0.2 mg / kg body weight ) on gestational days 11 and 12 , 13 and 14 , 15 and 16 , 17 and 18 , or 19 and 20@@ . offspring of rats administered dexamethasone on days 15 and 16 gestation had a 20 % reduction in glomerular number compared with control at 6 to 9 months of age ( 22 5@@ 27 + / -@@ 509 versus 28 0@@ 50 + / -5@@ 61 , p &lt; 0.05 ) , which was comparable to the percent reduction in glomeruli measured at 3 weeks of ag@@ e. six@@ - to 9 @-@ month old rats receiving prenatal dexamethasone on days 17 and 18 of gestation had a 17 % reduction in glomeruli ( 23 380 + / -5@@ 87 ) compared with control rats ( p &lt; 0.05 ) . male rats that received prenatal dexamethasone on days 15 and 16 , 17 and 18 , and 13 and 14 of gestation had elevated blood pressures at 6 months of age ; the latter group did not have a reduction in glomerular numb@@ er@@ . adult rats given dexamethasone on days 15 and 16 of gestation had more glomeruli with glomerulosclerosis than control rat@@ s. this study shows that prenatal dexamethasone in rats results in a reduction in glomerular number , glomerulosclerosis , and hypertension when administered at specific points during gest@@ ation@@ . hypertension was observed in animals that had a reduction in glomeruli as well as in a group that did not have a reduction in glomerular number , suggesting that a reduction in glomerular number is not the sole cause for the development of hypertension .

pharmacological evidence for the potential of d@@ auc@@ us caro@@ ta in the management of cognitive dys@@ function@@ s. the present study was aimed at investigating the effects of d@@ auc@@ us caro@@ ta seeds on cognitive functions , total serum cholesterol levels and brain cholinesterase activity in mic@@ e. the ethanolic extract of d@@ auc@@ us caro@@ ta seeds ( d@@ ce ) was administered orally in three doses ( 100 , 200 , 400 mg / kg ) for seven successive days to different groups of young and aged mic@@ e. elevated plus maze and passive avoidance apparatus served as the ex@@ ter@@ oceptive behavioral models for testing mem@@ or@@ y@@ . di@@ azep@@ am@@ - , scop@@ ol@@ amin@@ e- and ageing @-@ induced amnesia served as the inter@@ oceptive behavioral mod@@ el@@ s. d@@ ce ( 200 , 400 mg / kg , p.o. ) showed significant improvement in memory scores of young and aged mic@@ e. the extent of memory improvement evoked by d@@ ce was 23 % at the dose of 200 mg / kg and 35 % at the dose of 400 mg / kg in young mice using elevated plus maz@@ e. similarly , significant improvements in memory scores were observed using passive avoidance apparatus and aged mic@@ e. furthermore , d@@ ce reversed the amnesia induced by scopolamine ( 0.4 mg / kg , i.p. ) and diazepam ( 1 mg / kg , i.p. ) . d@@ auc@@ us caro@@ ta extract ( 200 , 400 mg / kg , p.o. ) reduced significantly the brain acetylcholinesterase activity and cholesterol levels in young and aged mic@@ e. the extent of inhibition of brain cholinesterase activity evoked by d@@ ce at the dose of 400 mg / kg was 22 % in young and 19 % in aged mic@@ e. there was a remarkable reduction in total cholesterol level as well , to the extent of 23 % in young and 21 % in aged animals with this dose of d@@ c@@ e. therefore , d@@ ce may prove to be a useful remedy for the management of cognitive dysfunctions on account of its multi@@ f@@ arious beneficial effects such as , memory improving property , cholesterol lowering property and anti@@ cholinesterase activity .
cauda equ@@ ina syndrome after epidural steroid injection : a case repor@@ t. objective : conventional treatment methods of lumb@@ us@@ acral radiculopathy are physical therapy , epidural steroid injections , oral medications , and spinal manip@@ ulative therap@@ y@@ . cauda equ@@ ina syndrome is a rare complication of epidural anesthesi@@ a. the following case is a report of cauda equ@@ ina syndrome possibly caused by epidural injection of triamcinolone and bup@@ ivac@@ ain@@ e. clinical features : a 50 @-@ year @-@ old woman with low back and right leg pain was scheduled for epidural steroid injec@@ tion@@ . intervention and outcome : an 18 @-@ gauge tou@@ h@@ y needle was inserted until loss of resistance occurred at the l@@ 4 @-@ 5 lev@@ el@@ . spread of the contrast medium within the epidural space was determined by radiographic imag@@ ing@@ . after ver@@ ifying the epidural space , bupivacaine and triamcinolone diacetate were injec@@ te@@ d. after the injection , there was a reduction in radicular symptom@@ s. three hours later , she complained of perineal numbness and lower extremity wea@@ kn@@ ess@@ . the neurologic evaluation revealed loss of sensation in the s@@ add@@ le area and medial aspect of her right le@@ g. there was a decrease in the perception of pin@@ prick test@@ . deep @-@ tendon reflexes were decreased especially in the right le@@ g. she was unable to urin@@ at@@ e. the patient &apos;s symptoms improved slightly over the next few hour@@ s. she had a gradual return of motor function and ability of feeling fol@@ ey catheter@@ . all of the symptoms were completely resolved over the next 8 hour@@ s. conclusion : complications associated with epidural steroid injections are ra@@ re@@ . clinical examination and continued vigilance for neurologic deterioration after epidural steroid injections is important .
high @-@ dose testosterone is associated with atherosclerosis in postmenopausal wom@@ en@@ . objectives : to study the long @-@ term effects of androgen treatment on atherosclerosis in postmenopausal wom@@ en@@ . methods : in a population @-@ based study in 5@@ 13 naturally postmenopausal women aged 54 @-@ 67 years , we studied the association between self @-@ reported intramuscularly administered high @-@ dose estrogen @-@ testosterone therapy ( estr@@ adi@@ ol@@ - and testosterone esters ) and aortic atheros@@ cler@@ osi@@ s. aortic atherosclerosis was diagnosed by radiographic detection of calcified deposits in the abdominal aorta , which have been shown to reflect intima atheros@@ cler@@ osi@@ s. hormone therapy users were compared with never us@@ er@@ s. results : intramuscular hormone therapy use for 1 year or longer was reported by 25 wom@@ en@@ . in almost half of these women severe atherosclerosis of the aorta was present ( n = 11 ) , while in women without hormone use severe atherosclerosis of the aorta was present in less than 20 % ( or 3.1 ; 95 % ci , 1.1 @-@ 8.5 , adjusted for age , years since menopause , smoking , and body mass index ) . the association remained after additional adjustment for diabetes , cholesterol level , systolic blood pressure , or alcohol use@@ . no association was found for hormone use less than 1 year@@ . conclusion : our results suggest that high @-@ dose testosterone therapy may adversely affect atherosclerosis in postmenopausal women and indicate that androgen replacement in these women may not be harm@@ less .
sirolimus @-@ associated proteinuria and renal dys@@ function@@ . sirolimus is a novel immunosuppressant with potent antiproliferative actions through its ability to inhibit the rap@@ tor @-@ containing mammalian target of rapamycin protein kin@@ as@@ e. sirolimus represents a major therapeutic advance in the prevention of acute renal allograft rejection and chronic allograft nephro@@ path@@ y@@ . its role in the therapy of glomerulonephritis , autoimmunity , cystic renal diseases and renal cancer is under investig@@ ation@@ . because sirolimus does not share the vasomotor renal adverse effects exhibited by calcineurin inhibitors , it has been designated a &apos; non @-@ nephrotoxic drug &apos; . however , clinical reports suggest that , under some circumstances , sirolimus is associated with proteinuria and acute renal dys@@ function@@ . a common risk factor appears to be presence of pre @-@ existing chronic renal dam@@ ag@@ e. the mechanisms of sirolimus @-@ associated proteinuria are multifactorial and may be due to an increase in glomerular capillary pressure following calcineurin inhibitor withdraw@@ al@@ . it has also been suggested that sirolimus directly causes increased glomerular permeability / injury , but evidence for this mechanism is currently in@@ con@@ clu@@ si@@ ve@@ . the acute renal dysfunction associated with sirolimus ( such as in delayed graft function ) may be due to suppression of compensatory renal cell proliferation and survival / repair process@@ es@@ . although these adverse effects occur in some patients , their occurrence could be minim@@ ised by knowledge of the molecular effects of sirolimus on the kidney , the use of sirolimus in appropriate patient populations , close monitoring of proteinuria and renal function , use of angiotensin @-@ converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin ii receptor blockers if proteinuria occurs and withdrawal if ne@@ ede@@ d. further long @-@ term analysis of renal allograft studies using sirolimus as de novo immunosuppression along with clinical and laboratory studies will refine these issues in the future .
progressive myopathy with up @-@ regulation of m@@ h@@ c @-@ i associated with statin therap@@ y@@ . statins can cause a necrotizing myopathy and hyper@@ c@@ k@@ aemia which is reversible on cessation of the dru@@ g. what is less well known is a phenomenon whereby statins may induce a myopathy , which persists or may progress after stopping the dru@@ g. we investigated the muscle pathology in 8 such cas@@ es@@ . all had myo@@ fibre necrosis but only 3 had an inflammatory infiltr@@ at@@ e. in all cases there was diffuse or multifocal up @-@ regulation of m@@ h@@ c @-@ i expression even in non @-@ necrotic fib@@ res@@ . progressive improvement occurred in 7 cases after commencement of prednisolone and methotrexate , and in one case spont@@ ane@@ ous@@ ly@@ . these observations suggest that statins may initiate an immune @-@ mediated myopathy that persists after withdrawal of the drug and responds to immunosuppressive therap@@ y@@ . the mechanism of this myopathy is uncertain but may involve the induction by statins of an endoplasmic reticulum stress response with associated up @-@ regulation of m@@ h@@ c @-@ i expression and antigen presentation by muscle fibres .
direct inhibition of cardiac hyperpolarization @-@ activated cyclic nucleotide @-@ gated pacemaker channels by clon@@ idine@@ . background : inhibition of cardiac sympathetic tone represents an important strategy for treatment of cardiovascular disease , including arrhythmia , coronary heart disease , and chronic heart fail@@ ure@@ . activation of presynaptic alpha2 @-@ adrenoceptors is the most widely accepted mechanism of action of the anti@@ sympathetic drug clonidine ; however , other target proteins have been postulated to contribute to the in vivo actions of clon@@ idine@@ . methods and results : to test whether clonidine elicits pharmacological effects independent of alpha2 @-@ adrenoceptors , we have generated mice with a targeted deletion of all 3 alpha2 @-@ adrenoceptor subtypes ( alpha@@ 2@@ ab@@ c@@ - / - ) . alpha@@ 2@@ ab@@ c@@ - / - mice were completely unresponsive to the analgesic and hypnotic effects of clonidine ; however , clonidine significantly lowered heart rate in alpha@@ 2@@ ab@@ c@@ - / - mice by up to 150 bp@@ m. clonidine @-@ induced bradycardia in conscious alpha@@ 2@@ ab@@ c@@ - / - mice was 32.3 % ( 10 microg / kg ) and 26.6 % ( 100 microg / kg ) of the effect in wild @-@ type mic@@ e. a similar brady@@ cardi@@ c effect of clonidine was observed in isolated spontaneously beating right atria from alpha@@ 2@@ ab@@ c @-@ knockout and wild @-@ type mic@@ e. clonidine inhibited the native pacemaker current ( i ( f ) ) in isolated sin@@ oatrial node pacemaker cells and the i ( f ) -@@ generating hyperpolarization @-@ activated cyclic nucleotide @-@ gated ( h@@ c@@ n ) 2 and h@@ cn@@ 4 channels in transfected he@@ k@@ 293 cell@@ s. as a consequence of blocking i ( f ) , clonidine reduced the slope of the diastolic depolarization and the frequency of pacemaker potentials in sin@@ oatrial node cells from wild @-@ type and alpha@@ 2@@ ab@@ c @-@ knockout mic@@ e. conclusions : direct inhibition of cardiac h@@ c@@ n pacemaker channels contributes to the brady@@ cardi@@ c effects of clonidine gene @-@ targeted mice in vivo , and thus , clonidine @-@ like drugs represent novel structures for future h@@ c@@ n channel inhibitors .
influence of smoking on developing co@@ ch@@ lea@@ . does smoking during pregnancy affect the amplitudes of transient evoked otoacoustic emissions in newborns ? objective : maternal tobacco smoking has negative effects on fetal grow@@ th@@ . the influence of smoking during pregnancy on the developing cochlea has not been estimated , although smoking has been positively associated with hearing loss in adul@@ ts@@ . the objective of this study was to determine the effects of maternal smoking on transient evoked otoacoustic emissions ( te@@ o@@ a@@ es ) of healthy neon@@ at@@ es@@ . methods : this study was undertaken as part of neonatal screening for hearing impairment and involved both ears of 200 new@@ bor@@ n@@ s. newborns whose mothers reported smoking during pregnancy ( n = 200 ears ) were compared to a control group of newborns ( n = 200 ears ) , whose mothers were non @-@ smo@@ ker@@ s. exposure to tobacco was characterized as low ( &lt; 5 cigarettes per day , n = 88 ears ) , moderate ( 5 &lt; or = cigarettes per day &lt; 10 , n = 76 ) or high ( &gt; or = 10 cigarettes per day , n = 36 ) . results : in exposed neonates , te@@ o@@ a@@ es mean response ( across frequency ) and mean amplitude at 4@@ 000@@ h@@ z was significantly lower than in non @-@ exposed neon@@ at@@ es@@ . comparisons between exposed newborns &apos; subgroups revealed no significant differen@@ c@@ es@@ . however , by comparing each subgroup to control group , we found statistically significant decreases of te@@ o@@ a@@ es amplitudes at 4@@ 000@@ h@@ z for all three grou@@ ps@@ . mean te@@ o@@ a@@ es responses of highly exposed newborns were also significantly lower in comparison to our control grou@@ p. conclusion : in utero , exposure to tobacco smoking seems to have a small impact on outer hair cell@@ s. these effects seem to be equally true for all exposed newborns , regardless of the degree of expos@@ ure@@ . further studies are needed in order to establish a potential negative effect of maternal smoking on the neonate &apos;s hearing acuity .
neuroinflammation and behavioral abnormalities after neonatal terbutaline treatment in rats : implications for au@@ tis@@ m. autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder presenting before 3 years of age with deficits in communication and social skills and repetitive behavi@@ or@@ s. in addition to genetic influences , recent studies suggest that prenatal drug or chemical exposures are risk factors for au@@ tis@@ m. terbutaline , a beta2 @-@ adrenoceptor agonist used to arrest preterm labor , has been associated with increased concordance for autism in diz@@ ygotic tw@@ in@@ s. we studied the effects of terbutaline on microglial activation in different brain regions and behavioral outcomes in developing rat@@ s. newborn rats were given terbutaline ( 10 mg / kg ) daily on postnatal days ( p@@ n ) 2 to 5 or p@@ n 11 to 14 and examined 24 h after the last dose and at p@@ n 30@@ . immunohistochemical studies showed that administration of terbutaline on p@@ n 2 to 5 produced a robust increase in microglial activation on p@@ n 30 in the cerebral cortex , as well as in cerebellar and cerebro@@ cortical white mat@@ ter@@ . none of these effects occurred in animals given terbutaline on p@@ n 11 to 14@@ . in behavioral tests , animals treated with terbutaline on p@@ n 2 to 5 showed consistent patterns of hyper @-@ reactivity to novelty and aversive stimuli when assessed in a novel open field , as well as in the acoustic startle response test@@ . our findings indicate that beta2 @-@ adrenoceptor over@@ stimulation during an early critical period results in microglial activation associated with innate neuro@@ inflammatory pathways and behavioral abnormalities , similar to those described in au@@ tis@@ m. this study provides a useful animal model for understanding the neuropathological processes underlying autism spectrum disorders .
acute myocarditis associated with cloz@@ ap@@ ine@@ . objective : a case of acute myocarditis associated with the commencement of clozapine is described , highlighting the onset , course and possible contributing factor@@ s. there is an urgent need to raise awareness about this potentially fatal complication of clozapine use@@ . results : a 20 @-@ year @-@ old male with schizophrenia developed a sudden onset of myocarditis after commencement of cloz@@ ap@@ ine@@ . the patient recovered with intensive medical sup@@ port@@ . the symptoms occurred around 2 weeks after starting clozapine in an inpatient set@@ tin@@ g. possible contributing factors may have been concomitant antidepressant use and un@@ acc@@ u@@ stom@@ ed physical activ@@ it@@ y@@ . conclusions : myocarditis is an increasingly recognized complication associated with the use of cloz@@ ap@@ ine@@ . it can be fatal if not recognized and treated ear@@ ly@@ . considering that clozapine remains the gold standard in treatment of resistant psychosis , there is an urgent need to raise awareness among medical and parame@@ dical staff involved in the care of these patient@@ s. there are also implications for recommendations and regulations regarding the use of clozapine .

the glycine transporter @-@ 1 inhibitor ss@@ r@@ 10@@ 38@@ 00 displays a selective and specific antipsychotic @-@ like profile in normal and transgenic mic@@ e. schizophrenia has been initially associated with dysfunction in dopamine neuro@@ transmis@@ sion@@ . however , the observation that antagonists of the glutamate n @-@ methyl @-@ d @-@ aspartate ( nm@@ da ) receptor produce schizophrenic @-@ like symptoms in humans has led to the idea of a dys@@ functioning of the glutamatergic system via its nm@@ da recep@@ tor@@ . as a result , there is a growing interest in the development of pharmacological agents with potential antipsychotic properties that enhance the activity of the glutamatergic system via a modulation of the nm@@ da recep@@ tor@@ . among them are glycine transporter @-@ 1 ( gl@@ yt@@ 1 ) inhibitors such as ss@@ r@@ 10@@ 38@@ 00 , which indirectly enhance nm@@ da receptor function by increasing the glycine ( a co @-@ agonist for the nm@@ da receptor ) levels in the synap@@ se@@ . this study aimed at investigating the potential antipsychotic @-@ like properties of ss@@ r@@ 10@@ 38@@ 00 , with a particular focus on models of hyperactivity , involving either drug challenge ( ie , amphetamine and m@@ k @-@ 801 ) or transgenic mice ( ie , nm@@ da n@@ r1 ( neo@@ - / - ) and d@@ at ( - / - ) ) . results showed that ss@@ r@@ 10@@ 38@@ 00 ( 10 @-@ 30 mg / kg p.o. ) blocked hyperactivity induced by the non @-@ competitive nm@@ da receptor antagonist , m@@ k @-@ 801 and partially reversed spontaneous hyperactivity of nm@@ da n@@ r1 ( neo@@ - / - ) mic@@ e. in contrast , ss@@ r@@ 10@@ 38@@ 00 failed to affect hyperactivity induced by amphetamine or naturally observed in dopamine transporter ( d@@ at ( - / - ) ) knockout mice ( 10 @-@ 30 mg / kg p.o. ) . importantly , both classical ( haloperidol ) and atypical ( olanzapine , clozapine and aripiprazole ) antipsychotics were effective in all these models of hyper@@ activ@@ it@@ y@@ . however , unlike these latter , ss@@ r@@ 10@@ 38@@ 00 did not produce catal@@ epsy ( retention on the bar test ) up to 30 mg / kg p.o. together these findings show that the gl@@ yt@@ 1 inhibitor , ss@@ r@@ 10@@ 38@@ 00 , produces antipsychotic @-@ like effects , which differ from those observed with compounds primarily targeting the dopaminergic system , and has a reduced side @-@ effect potential as compared with these latter drugs .
phenylephrine but not ephedrine reduces frontal lobe oxygenation following anesthesia @-@ induced hypot@@ en@@ sion@@ . background : vasop@@ ressor agents are used to correct anesthesia @-@ induced hypot@@ en@@ sion@@ . we describe the effect of phenylephrine and ephedrine on frontal lobe oxygenation ( s ( c ) o ( 2 ) ) following anesthesia @-@ induced hypot@@ en@@ sion@@ . methods : following induction of anesthesia by fentanyl ( 0.15 mg kg ( -1 ) ) and propofol ( 2.0 mg kg ( -1 ) ) , 13 patients received phenylephrine ( 0.1 mg iv ) and 12 patients received ephedrine ( 10 mg iv ) to restore mean arterial pressure ( map ) . heart rate ( hr ) , map , stroke volume ( s@@ v ) , cardiac output ( co ) , and frontal lobe oxygenation ( s ( c ) o ( 2 ) ) were regi@@ stere@@ d. results : induction of anesthesia was followed by a decrease in map , hr , s@@ v , and co concomitant with an elevation in s ( c ) o ( 2 ) . after administration of phenylephrine , map increased ( 51 + / - 12 to 81 + / - 13 mm@@ h@@ g ; p &lt; 0.001 ; mean + / - sd ) . however , a 14 % ( from 70 + / - 8 % to 60 + / - 7 % ) reduction in s ( c ) o ( 2 ) ( p &lt; 0.05 ) followed with no change in co ( 3.7 + / - 1.1 to 3.4 + / - 0.9 l min ( -1 ) ) . the administration of ephedrine led to a similar increase in map ( 53 + / - 9 to 79 + / - 8 mm@@ h@@ g ; p &lt; 0.001 ) , restored co ( 3.2 + / - 1.2 to 5.0 + / - 1.3 l min ( -1 ) ) , and preserved s ( c ) o ( 2 ) . conclusions : the utilization of phenylephrine to correct hypotension induced by anesthesia has a negative impact on s ( c ) o ( 2 ) while ephedrine maintains frontal lobe oxygenation potentially related to an increase in co .
a novel , multiple symptom model of obsessive @-@ compulsive @-@ like behaviors in anim@@ al@@ s. background : current animal models of obsessive @-@ compulsive disorder ( oc@@ d ) typically involve acute , drug @-@ induced symptom provocation or a genetic association with stere@@ otyp@@ ies or anxi@@ et@@ y@@ . none of these current models demonstrate multiple oc@@ d @-@ like behavi@@ or@@ s. methods : neonatal rats were treated with the tricyclic antidepressant clomi@@ pramine or vehicle between days 9 and 16 twice daily and behaviorally tested in adul@@ tho@@ od@@ . results : clomi@@ pramine exposure in immature rats produced significant behavioral and biochemical changes that include enhanced anxiety ( elevated plus maze and mar@@ ble bur@@ ying ) , behavioral inf@@ lex@@ ibility ( per@@ sev@@ eration in the spontaneous alternation task and impaired reversal learning ) , working memory impairment ( e.g. , win @-@ shift paradigm ) , ho@@ arding , and cortico@@ striatal dys@@ function@@ . dopamine d2 receptors were elevated in the striatum , whereas serotonin 2c , but not serotonin 1a , receptors were elevated in the orbital frontal cor@@ tex@@ . conclusions : this is the first demonstration of multiple symptoms consistent with an oc@@ d @-@ like profile in anim@@ al@@ s. moreover , these behaviors are accompanied by biochemical changes in brain regions previously identified as relevant to oc@@ d. this novel model of oc@@ d demonstrates that drug exposure during a sensitive period can program disease @-@ like systems permanently , which could have implications for current and future therapeutic strategies for this and other psychiatric disorders .

changes in depressive status associated with topical beta @-@ bloc@@ ker@@ s. depression and sexual dysfunction have been related to side effects of topical beta @-@ bloc@@ ker@@ s. we performed a preliminary study in order to determine any difference between a non selective beta @-@ blocker ( timolol ) and a selective beta @-@ blocker ( bet@@ ax@@ olol ) regarding c@@ ns side effec@@ ts@@ . eight glaucomatous patients chronically treated with timolol 0.5 % / 12@@ h , suffering from depression diagnosed through d@@ ms @-@ iii @-@ r criteria , were included in the stud@@ y@@ . during the six @-@ month follow up , depression was quantified through the bec@@ k and z@@ ung @-@ con@@ de scales every two mon@@ th@@ s. in a double blind cross @-@ over study with control group , the patients under timolol treatment presented higher depression values measured through the bec@@ k and the z@@ ung @-@ con@@ de scales ( p &lt; 0.001 vs control ) . these results suggest that bet@@ ax@@ olol could be less of a depression @-@ inducer than timolol in predisposed patients .
long @-@ term follow @-@ up of ifosfamide renal toxicity in children treated for malignant mesenchymal tumors : an international society of pediatric oncology repor@@ t. the renal function of 74 children with malignant mesenchymal tumors in complete remission and who have received the same ifosfamide chemotherapy protocol ( international society of pediatric oncology malignant mesenchymal tumor study 84 &#91; si@@ op mm@@ t 84 &#93; ) were studied 1 year after the completion of treat@@ ment@@ . total cumulative doses were 36 or 60 g / m2 of ifosfamide ( six or 10 cycles of ifosfamide , vincristine , and d@@ actinomycin &#91; iva &#93; ) . none of them had received cisplatin chemo@@ therap@@ y@@ . ages ranged from 4 months to 17 years ; 58 patients were males and 42 fem@@ al@@ es@@ . the most common primary tumor site was the head and nec@@ k@@ . renal function was investigated by measuring plasma and urinary electrolytes , glucos@@ uria , proteinuria , amino@@ acid@@ uria , urinary ph , osmolarity , creatinine clearance , phosphate tubular reabsorption , beta 2 micro@@ glob@@ ulin@@ uria , and lyso@@ zym@@ ur@@ i@@ a. fifty @-@ eight patients ( 78 % ) had normal renal tests , whereas 16 patients ( 22 % ) had renal abnormal@@ iti@@ es@@ . two subsets of patients were identified from this latter group : the first included four patients ( 5 % of the total population ) who developed major toxicity resulting in f@@ an@@ coni &apos;s syndrome ( t@@ d@@ fs ) ; and the second group included five patients with elevated beta 2 micro@@ glob@@ ulin@@ uria and low phosphate re@@ absorp@@ tion@@ . the remaining seven patients had isolated beta 2 micro@@ glob@@ ulin@@ ur@@ i@@ a. severe toxicity was correlated with the higher cumulative dose of 60 g / m2 of ifosfamide , a younger age ( less than 2 1 / 2 years old ) , and a predominance of vesi@@ co@@ prostatic tumor invol@@ v@@ ement@@ . this low percentage ( 5 % ) of t@@ d@@ fs must be evaluated with respect to the efficacy of ifosfamide in the treatment of mesenchymal tumors in children .
evidence for an involvement of d1 and d2 dopamine receptors in mediating nicotine @-@ induced hyperactivity in rat@@ s. previous studies have suggested that repeated exposure of rats to the drug or to the experimental environment is necessary to observe nicotine @-@ induced locomotor stimul@@ ation@@ . in the present study the role of habituation to the experimental environment on the stimulant effect of nicotine in rats was examin@@ ed@@ . in addition , the role of dopamine receptors in mediating nicotine @-@ induced locomotor stimulation was investigated by examining the effects of selective d1 and d2 dopamine receptor antagonists on activity induced by nic@@ oti@@ ne@@ . locomotor activity was assessed in male sp@@ rag@@ ue @-@ d@@ aw@@ ley rats tested in photoc@@ ell c@@ ag@@ es@@ . nicotine ( 1.0 mg / kg ) caused a significant increase in locomotor activity in rats that were hab@@ itu@@ ated to the test environment , but had only a weak and delayed stimulant action in rats that were unfamiliar with the test environ@@ ment@@ . the stimulant action of nicotine was blocked by the central nicotinic antagonist mec@@ amyl@@ amine but not by the peripheral nicotinic blocker hexam@@ ethonium , indicating that the response is probably mediated by central nicotinic recep@@ tor@@ s. nicotine @-@ induced hyperactivity was blocked by the selective d1 antagonist sch 23@@ 390 , the selective d2 antagonist rac@@ lop@@ ride and the d1 / d2 antagonist flu@@ phen@@ az@@ ine@@ . pretreatment with the d2 agonist ph@@ no enhanced nicotine @-@ induced hyperactivity , whereas the d1 agonist sk@@ f 38@@ 393 had no effec@@ t. the results indicate that acute nicotine injection induces a pronounced hyperactivity in rats hab@@ itu@@ ated to the test environ@@ ment@@ . the effect appears to be mediated by central nicotine receptors , possibly located on dopaminergic neurons , and also requires the activation of both d1 and d2 dopamine receptors .
neuropsychiatric side effects after the use of me@@ flo@@ qu@@ ine@@ . this study describes neuropsychiatric side effects in patients after treatment with me@@ flo@@ qu@@ ine@@ . reactions consisted mainly of seizures , acute psychoses , anxiety neuro@@ sis , and major disturbances of sleep @-@ wake rhyth@@ m. side effects occurred after both therapeutic and prophylactic intake and were graded from moderate to sev@@ ere@@ . in a risk analysis of neuropsychiatric side effects in ger@@ many , it is estimated that one of 8@@ ,000 me@@ flo@@ quine users suffers from such re@@ action@@ s. the incidence calculation revealed that one of 215 therapeutic users had reactions , compared with one of 13@@ ,000 in the prophylaxis group , making the risk of neuropsychiatric reactions after me@@ flo@@ quine treatment 60 times higher than after prophyl@@ ax@@ is@@ . therefore , certain limitations for malaria prophylaxis and treatment with me@@ flo@@ quine are recommended .
reduction in injection pain using buffered lidocaine as a local anesthetic before cardiac catheter@@ iz@@ ation@@ . previous reports have suggested that pain associated with the injection of lidocaine is related to the acidic ph of the solu@@ tion@@ . to determine if the addition of a buffering solution to adjust the ph of lidocaine into the physiologic range would reduce pain during injection , we performed a blinded randomized study in patients undergoing cardiac catheter@@ iz@@ ation@@ . twenty patients were asked to quantify the severity of pain after receiving standard lidocaine in one femoral area and buffered lidocaine in the opposite femoral are@@ a. the mean pain score for buffered lidocaine was significantly lower than the mean score for standard lidocaine ( 2.7 + / - 1.9 vs. 3.8 + / - 2.2 , p = 0.03 ) . the ph adjustment of standard lidocaine can be accomplished easily in the catheterization laboratory before injection and results in a reduction of the pain occurring during the infiltration of tissues .
randomized , double @-@ blind trial of maz@@ ind@@ ol in du@@ chenne dystroph@@ y@@ . there is evidence that growth hormone may be related to the progression of weakness in du@@ chenne dystroph@@ y@@ . we conducted a 12 @-@ month controlled trial of maz@@ ind@@ ol , a putative growth hormone secretion inhibitor , in 83 boys with du@@ chenne dystroph@@ y@@ . muscle strength , contractures , functional ability and pulmonary function were tested at baseline , and 6 and 12 months after treatment with maz@@ ind@@ ol ( 3 mg / d ) or plac@@ e@@ bo@@ . the study was designed to have a power of greater than 0.90 to detect a slowing to 25 % of the expected rate of progression of weakness at p less than 0.0@@ 5@@ . maz@@ ind@@ ol did not benefit strength at any point in the stud@@ y@@ . side effects attributable to maz@@ ind@@ ol included decreased appetite ( 36 % ) , dry mouth ( 10 % ) , behavioral change ( 22 % ) , and gastrointestinal symptoms ( 18 % ) ; maz@@ ind@@ ol dosage was reduced in 43 % of patient@@ s. the effect of maz@@ ind@@ ol on gh secretion was estimated indirectly by comparing the post@@ absorptive ig@@ f @-@ i levels obtained following 3 , 6 , 9 , and 12 months in the maz@@ ind@@ ol treated to those in the placebo grou@@ ps@@ . although maz@@ ind@@ ol @-@ treated patients gained less weight and height than placebo @-@ treated patients , no significant effect on ig@@ f @-@ i levels was obser@@ ve@@ d. maz@@ ind@@ ol doses not slow the progression of weakness in du@@ chenne dystrophy .
pentoxifylline ( tren@@ tal ) does not inhibit dipyridamole @-@ induced coronary hyperemia : implications for dipyridamole @-@ thallium @-@ 201 myocardial imag@@ ing@@ . dipyridamole @-@ thallium @-@ 201 imaging is often performed in patients unable to exercise because of peripheral vascular dise@@ as@@ e. many of these patients are taking pentoxifylline ( tren@@ tal ) , a methyl@@ xanthine derivative which may improve intermittent clau@@ dic@@ ation@@ . whether pentoxifylline inhibits dipyridamole @-@ induced coronary hyperemia like other methyl@@ xanth@@ ines such as theophylline and should be stopped prior to dipyridamole @-@ thallium @-@ 201 imaging is un@@ know@@ n@@ . therefore , we studied the hypere@@ mic response to dipyridamole in seven open @-@ chest anesthetized dogs after pretreatment with either pentoxifylline ( 0 , 7.5 , or 15 mg / kg i.v. ) or theophylline ( 3 mg / kg i.v. ) . baseline circumflex coronary blood flows did not differ significantly among treatment grou@@ ps@@ . dipyridamole significantly increased coronary blood flow before and after 7.5 or 15 mm / kg i.v. pentoxifylline ( p less than 0.002 ) . neither dose of pentoxifylline significantly decreased the dipyridamole @-@ induced hyperemia , while peak coronary blood flow was significantly lower after theophylline ( p less than 0.01 ) . we conclude that pent@@ oxy@@ if@@ ylline does not inhibit dipyridamole @-@ induced coronary hyperemia even at high doses .
cause of death among patients with parkin@@ son &apos;s disease : a rare mortality due to cerebral haemorrh@@ ag@@ e. causes of death , with special reference to cerebral haemorrhage , among 240 patients with pathologically verified parkin@@ son &apos;s disease were investigated using the ann@@ uals of the pathological autopsy cases in j@@ ap@@ an from 1981 to 198@@ 5@@ . the leading causes of death were pneumonia and bronchitis ( 4@@ 4.1 % ) , malignant neoplasms ( 11.6 % ) , heart diseases ( 4.1 % ) , cerebral infarction ( 3.7 % ) and septicaemia ( 3.3 % ) . cerebral haemorrhage was the 11@@ th most frequent cause of death , accounting for only 0.8 % of deaths among the patients , whereas it was the 5th most common cause of death among the j@@ ap@@ anese general population in 198@@ 5@@ . the low incidence of cerebral haemorrhage as a cause of death in patients with parkin@@ son &apos;s disease may reflect the hypotensive effect of levodopa and a hypotensive mechanism due to reduced noradrenaline levels in the parkinsonian brain .
tolerance and antiviral effect of ribavirin in patients with ar@@ gen@@ tine hemorrhagic f@@ ever@@ . tolerance and antiviral effect of ribavirin was studied in 6 patients with ar@@ gen@@ tine hemorrhagic fever ( ah@@ f ) of more than 8 days of evolution@@ . administration of ribavirin resulted in a neutralization of viremia and a drop of endogenous interferon ti@@ ter@@ s. the average time of death was del@@ ay@@ ed@@ . a reversible anemia was the only adverse effect obser@@ ve@@ d. from these results , we conclude that ribavirin has an antiviral effect in advanced cases of ah@@ f , and that anemia , the only secondary reaction observed , can be easily manag@@ ed@@ . the possible beneficial effect of ribavirin during the initial days of ah@@ f is discussed .
dipyridamole @-@ induced myocardial ischem@@ i@@ a. angina and ischemic electrocardiographic changes occurred after administration of oral dipyridamole in four patients awaiting urgent myocardial revascularization proced@@ u@@ res@@ . to our knowledge , this has not previously been reported as a side effect of preoperative dipyridamole therapy , although dipyridamole @-@ induced myocardial ischemia has been demonstrated to occur in animals and humans with coronary artery dise@@ as@@ e. epicardial coronary collateral vessels were demonstrated in all four patients ; a coronary &quot; ste@@ al &quot; phenomenon may be the mechanism of the dipyridamole @-@ induced ischemia observed .
inhibition of immunoreactive corticotropin @-@ releasing factor secretion into the hypophysi@@ al @-@ portal circulation by delayed glucocorticoid feed@@ back@@ . nitroprusside @-@ induced hypotension evokes ac@@ th secretion which is primarily mediated by enhanced secretion of immunoreactive corticotropin @-@ releasing factor ( ir@@ cr@@ f ) into the hypophysi@@ al @-@ portal circul@@ ation@@ . portal plasma concentrations of neither arginine vasopressin nor oxytocin are significantly altered in this paradig@@ m. application of a delayed feedback signal , in the form of a 2 @-@ h systemic corticosterone infusion in urethane @-@ anesthetized rats with pharmacological blockade of glucocorticoid synthesis , is without effect on the resting secretion of arginine vasopressin and oxytocin at any corticosterone feedback dose te@@ ste@@ d. resting ir@@ cr@@ f levels are suppressed only at the highest corticosterone infusion rate , which resulted in systemic corticosterone levels of 40 micrograms / dl@@ . suppression of ir@@ cr@@ f secretion in response to nitroprusside @-@ induced hypotension is observed and occurs at a plasma corticosterone level between 8 @-@ 12 micrograms / dl@@ . these studies provide further evidence for a strong central component of the delayed feedback process which is mediated by modulation of ir@@ cr@@ f release .
noradrenergic involvement in catal@@ epsy induced by delta 9 @-@ tetrahydro@@ cannabin@@ ol@@ . in order to elucidate the role of the catecholaminergic system in the catal@@ ep@@ togenic effect of delta 9 @-@ tetrahydrocannabinol ( th@@ c ) , the effect of pretreatment with 6 @-@ hydroxydopamine ( 6 @-@ oh@@ da ) or with desipramine and 6 @-@ oh@@ da and lesions of the locus coeruleus were investigated in rat@@ s. the catal@@ ep@@ togenic effect of th@@ c was significantly reduced in rats treated with 6 @-@ oh@@ da and in rats with lesions of the locus coeruleus but not in rats treated with desipramine and 6 @-@ oh@@ da , as compared with control rat@@ s. on the contrary , the catal@@ ep@@ togenic effect of haloperidol was significantly reduced in rats treated with desipramine and 6 @-@ oh@@ da but not in rats treated with 6 @-@ oh@@ da or in rats with lesions of the locus coerul@@ e@@ us@@ . these results indicate that noradrenergic neurons have an important role in the manifestation of catal@@ epsy induced by th@@ c , whereas dopaminergic neurons are important in catal@@ epsy induced by haloperidol .
intracranial pressure increases during alfentanil @-@ induced rig@@ id@@ it@@ y@@ . intracranial pressure ( ic@@ p ) was measured during alfentanil @-@ induced rigidity in rat@@ s. ten rats had arterial , central venous ( c@@ v@@ p ) , and subdural cann@@ ulae inserted under halothane anesthesi@@ a. the animals were mechanically ventilated to achieve norm@@ ocar@@ bia ( p@@ co@@ 2 = 42 + / - 1 mm@@ h@@ g , mean + / - se ) . following instrumentation , halothane was discontinued and alfentanil ( 125 mu / kg ) administered iv during emergence from halothane anesthesi@@ a. in the five rats that developed somatic rigidity , ic@@ p and c@@ v@@ p increased significantly above baseline ( delta ic@@ p 7.5 + / - 1.0 mm@@ h@@ g , delta c@@ v@@ p 5.9 + / - 1.3 mm@@ h@@ g ) . these variables returned to baseline when rigidity was abolished with met@@ oc@@ ur@@ ine@@ . in five rats that did not become rigid , ic@@ p and c@@ v@@ p did not change following al@@ fentan@@ il@@ . these observations suggest that rigidity should be prevented when alfentanil , and , presumably , other opiates , are used in the anesthetic management of patients with ic@@ p problems .
adverse cardiac effects during induction chemotherapy treatment with cis @-@ platin and 5 @-@ fluoro@@ ur@@ ac@@ il@@ . survival for patients with advanced head and neck carcinoma and esophageal carcinoma is poor with radiotherapy and / or surg@@ ery@@ . obviously , there is a need for effective chemo@@ therap@@ y@@ . in the present study , cis @-@ platin ( 80 @-@ 120 mg / m@@ 2@@ b@@ sa ) and 5 @-@ f@@ u ( 1000 mg / m@@ 2@@ b@@ sa daily as a continuous infusion during 5 days ) were given to 76 patients before radiotherapy and surg@@ ery@@ . the aim of the study was to clarify the incidence and severity of adverse cardiac effects to this treat@@ ment@@ . before treatment all patients had a cardiac evaluation and during treatment serial ec@@ g recordings were perfor@@ med@@ . in the pre @-@ treatment evaluation , signs of cardiovascular disease were found in 33 patients ( 43 % ) . during treatment , adverse cardiac effects were observed in 14 patients ( 18 % ) . the mean age of these patients was the same as for the entire group , 64 year@@ s. the incidence of cardiotoxicity was not higher in patients with signs of cardiovascular disease than in those without in the pre @-@ treatment evalu@@ ation@@ . the most common signs of cardiotoxicity were chest pain , st @-@ t wave changes and atrial fibrill@@ ation@@ . this was followed by ventricular fibrillation in one patient and sudden death in an@@ other@@ . it is concluded that patients on 5 @-@ f@@ u treatment should be under close supervision and that the treatment should be discontinued if chest pain or tachy@@ arrhythmia is observed .
verapamil @-@ induced carbamazepine neuro@@ toxic@@ it@@ y@@ . a report of two cas@@ es@@ . two patients with signs of carbamazepine neurotoxicity after combined treatment with verapamil showed complete recovery after discontinuation of the calcium entry bloc@@ ker@@ . use of verapamil in combination with carbamazepine should either be avoided or prescribed only with appropriate adjustment of the carbamazepine dose ( usually reduction of the carbamazepine dose by one half ) .
serial studies of auditory neurotoxicity in patients receiving defer@@ oxamine therap@@ y@@ . visual and auditory neurotoxicity was previously documented in 42 of 89 patients with transfusion @-@ dependent anemia who were receiving iron chelation therapy with daily subcutaneous defer@@ ox@@ amin@@ e. twenty @-@ two patients in the affected group had abnormal audi@@ ograms with deficits mostly in the high frequency range of 4,000 to 8@@ ,000 h@@ z and in the hearing threshold levels of 30 to 100 dec@@ ib@@ el@@ s. when defer@@ oxamine therapy was discontinued and serial studies were performed , audi@@ ograms in seven cases reverted to normal or near normal within two to three weeks , and nine of 13 patients with symptoms became asym@@ ptom@@ atic@@ . audi@@ ograms from 15 patients remained abnormal and four patients required hearing aids because of permanent dis@@ abil@@ it@@ y@@ . since 18 of the 22 patients were initially receiving defer@@ oxamine doses in excess of the commonly recommended 50 mg / kg per dose , therapy was rest@@ ar@@ ted with lower doses , usually 50 mg / kg per dose or less depending on the degree of auditory abnormality , and with the exception of two cases no further toxicity was demonstr@@ ated@@ . auditory deterioration and improvement , demonstrated serially in individual patients receiving and not receiving defer@@ oxamine , respectively , provided convincing evidence for a cause @-@ and @-@ effect relation between defer@@ oxamine administration and ot@@ otoxic@@ it@@ y@@ . based on these data , a plan of management was developed that allows effective yet safe administration of defer@@ ox@@ amin@@ e. a dose of 50 mg / kg is recommended in those without audi@@ ogram abnormal@@ iti@@ es@@ . with mild toxicity , a reduction to 30 or 40 mg / kg per dose should result in a reversal of the abnormal results to normal within four week@@ s. moderate abnormalities require a reduction of defer@@ oxamine to 25 mg / kg per dose with careful monit@@ or@@ ing@@ . in those with symptoms of hearing loss , the drug should be stopped for four weeks , and when the audi@@ ogram is stable or improved , therapy should be rest@@ ar@@ ted at 10 to 25 mg / kg per dos@@ e. serial audi@@ ograms should be performed every six months in those without problems and more frequently in young patients with normal serum ferritin values and in those with auditory dysfunction .
flur@@ bi@@ profen in the treatment of juvenile rheumatoid arth@@ ri@@ tis@@ . thirty @-@ four patients with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis , who were treated with flur@@ bi@@ profen at a maximum dose of 4 mg / kg / day , had statistically significant decreases from baseline in 6 arthritis indices after 12 weeks of treat@@ ment@@ . improvements were seen in the number of tender joints , the severity of swelling and tenderness , the time of walk 50 feet , the duration of morning stiffness and the circumference of the left kne@@ e. the most frequently observed side effect was fecal occult blood ( 25 % of patients ) ; however , there was no other evidence of gastrointestinal ( gi ) bleeding in these patient@@ s. one patient was prematurely discontinued from the study for severe headache and abdominal pain@@ . most side effects were mild and related to the gi tract .
the correlation between neurotoxic esterase inhibition and mi@@ pa@@ fo@@ x @-@ induced neuropathic damage in rat@@ s. the correlation between neuropathic damage and inhibition of neurotoxic esterase or neuropathy target enzyme ( n@@ te ) was examined in rats acutely exposed to mi@@ pa@@ fo@@ x ( n , n &apos; -di@@ isopropyl@@ phosphoro@@ di@@ amido@@ fluor@@ idate ) , a neurotoxic organophosph@@ at@@ e. brain and spinal cord n@@ te activities were measured in long @-@ ev@@ ans male rats 1 hr post @-@ exposure to various dosages of mi@@ pa@@ fo@@ x ( ip , 1 @-@ 15 mg / kg ) . these data were correlated with histologically scored cervical cord damage in a separate group of similarly dosed rats sampled 14 @-@ 21 days post @-@ expos@@ ure@@ . those dosages ( greater than or equal to 10 mg / kg ) that inhibited mean n@@ te activity in the spinal cord greater than or equal to 73 % and brain greater than or equal to 67 % of control values produced severe ( greater than or equal to 3 ) cervical cord pathology in 85 % of the rat@@ s. in contrast , dosages of mi@@ pa@@ fo@@ x ( less than or equal to 5 mg / kg ) which inhibited mean n@@ te activity in spinal cord less than or equal to 61 % and brain less than or equal to 60 % produced this degree of cord damage in only 9 % of the anim@@ al@@ s. these data indicate that a critical percentage of n@@ te inhibition in brain and spinal cord sampled shortly after mi@@ pa@@ fo@@ x exposure can predict neuropathic damage in rats several weeks later .

maternal lithium and neonatal eb@@ stein &apos;s anomaly : evaluation with cross @-@ sectional echocardi@@ og@@ rap@@ hy@@ . cross @-@ sectional echocardiography was used to evaluate two neonates whose mothers ingested lithium during pregn@@ anc@@ y@@ . in one infant , eb@@ stein &apos;s anomaly of the tricuspid valve was identi@@ fi@@ ed@@ . in the other infant cross @-@ sectional echocardiography provided re@@ assurance that the infant did not have eb@@ stein &apos;s an@@ om@@ aly@@ . cross @-@ sectional echocardiographic screening of newborns exposed to lithium during gestation can provide highly accurate , noninvasive assessment of the presence or absence of lithium @-@ induced cardiac malformations .
effects of training on the extent of experimental myocardial infarction in aging rat@@ s. the effects of exercise on the severity of isoproterenol @-@ induced myocardial infarction were studied in female albino rats of 20,@@ 40@@ ,@@ 60 and 80 weeks of ag@@ e. the rats were trained to swim for a specific duration and for a particular period@@ . the occurrence of infarcts were confirmed by histological method@@ s. elevations in the serum got and gp@@ t were maximum in the sedentary @-@ iso@@ prote@@ ren@@ ols and minimum in the exercise @-@ contro@@ l@@ s. these changes in the serum transaminases were associated with corresponding depl@@ e@@ tions in the cardiac got and gp@@ t. however , age was seen to interfere with the responses exhibited by the young and old rat@@ s. studies dealing with myocardial infarction are more informative when dealt with age .
effect of polyethylene glycol 400 on adriamycin toxicity in mic@@ e. the effect of a widely used organic solvent , polyethylene glycol 400 ( pe@@ g 400 ) , on the toxic action of an acute or chronic treatment with adriamycin ( ad@@ r ) was evaluated in mic@@ e. pe@@ g 400 im@@ pres@@ sively decreased both acute high @-@ dose and chronic low @-@ dose @-@ ad@@ r @-@ associated le@@ thal@@ it@@ y@@ . light microscopic analysis showed a significant protection against ad@@ r @-@ induced cardiac morphological alter@@ ation@@ s. such treatment did not diminish the ad@@ r antitumor activity in l@@ 1210 leukemia and in e@@ hr@@ lich ascites tumor .
intra @-@ arterial bc@@ nu chemotherapy for treatment of malignant gliomas of the central nervous system@@ . because of the rapid systemic clearance of bc@@ nu ( 1,3 @-@ bis- ( 2 @-@ chloro@@ ethyl ) -1 @-@ nitrosourea ) , intra @-@ arterial administration should provide a substantial advantage over intravenous administration for the treatment of malignant gli@@ omas@@ . thirty @-@ six patients were treated with bc@@ nu every 6 to 8 weeks , either by trans@@ femoral catheterization of the internal carotid or vertebral artery or through a fully implantable intrac@@ aro@@ tid drug delivery system , beginning with a dose of 200 mg / s@@ q m body surface are@@ a. twelve patients with grade iii or iv astrocytomas were treated after partial resection of the tumor without prior radiation therap@@ y@@ . after two to seven cycles of chemotherapy , nine patients showed a decrease in tumor size and surrounding edema on contrast @-@ enhanced computerized tomography sc@@ an@@ s. in the nine responders , median duration of chemotherapy response from the time of operation was 25 weeks ( range 12 to more than 91 weeks ) . the median duration of survival in the 12 patients was 54 weeks ( range 21 to more than 156 weeks ) , with an 18 @-@ month survival rate of 42 % . twenty @-@ four patients with recurrent grade i to iv astrocytomas , whose resection and irradiation therapy had failed , received two to eight courses of intra @-@ arterial bc@@ nu therap@@ y@@ . seventeen of these had a response or were stable for a median of 20 weeks ( range 6 to more than 66 weeks ) . the catheterization procedure is safe , with no immediate complication in 111 infusions of bc@@ nu@@ . a delayed complication in nine patients has been unilateral loss of vision secondary to a retinal vascul@@ iti@@ s. the frequency of visual loss decreased after the concentration of the ethanol dilu@@ ent was lowered .
blood pressure response to chronic low @-@ dose intrarenal noradrenaline infusion in conscious rat@@ s. sodium chloride solution ( 0.9 % ) or noradrenaline in doses of 4 , 12 and 36 micrograms h @-@ 1 kg @-@ 1 was infused for five consecutive days , either intra@@ ren@@ ally ( by a new technique ) or intravenously into rats with one kidney remo@@ ve@@ d. intrarenal infusion of noradrenaline caused hypertension at doses which did not do so when infused intrav@@ en@@ ous@@ ly@@ . intrarenal compared with intravenous infusion of noradrenaline caused higher plasma noradrenaline concentrations and a shift of the plasma noradrenaline concentration @-@ blood pressure effect curve towards lower plasma noradrenaline lev@@ el@@ s. these results suggest that hypertension after chronic intrarenal noradrenaline infusion is produced by relatively higher levels of circulating noradrenaline and by triggering of an additional intrarenal pressor mechanism .
age and renal clearance of cim@@ eti@@ d@@ ine@@ . in 35 patients ( ages 20 to 86 yr ) receiving cimetidine therapeutically two serum samples and all urine formed in the interim were collected for analysis of cimetidine by high @-@ pressure liquid chromatography and for creatin@@ ine@@ . cimetidine clearance decreased with ag@@ e. the extrapolated 6 @-@ hr serum concentration of cimetidine per unit dose , after intravenous cimetidine , increased with age of the patient@@ s. the ratio of cimetidine clearance to creatinine clearance ( r@@ c ) averaged 4.8 + / - 2.0 , indicating net tubular secretion for cim@@ eti@@ d@@ ine@@ . r@@ c seemed to be independent of age and decreased with increasing serum concentration of cimetidine , suggesting that secretion of cimetidine is a saturable process@@ . there was only one case of dementia possibly due to cimetidine ( with a drug level of 1.9 microgram / ml 6 hr after a dose ) in a group of 13 patients without liver or kidney disease who had cimetidine levels above 1.25 microgram / m@@ l@@ . thus , high cimetidine levels alone do not always induce dementia .

phen@@ obarbitone @-@ induced enlargement of the liver in the rat : its relationship to carbon tetrachloride @-@ induced cirrho@@ si@@ s. the yield of severe cirrhosis of the liver ( defined as a sh@@ run@@ ken finely nodular liver with micron@@ odular histology , ascites greater than 30 ml , plasma albumin less than 2.2 g / dl , splenomegaly 2 @-@ 3 times normal , and testicular atrophy approximately half normal weight ) after 12 doses of carbon tetrachloride given intrag@@ astr@@ ically in the phen@@ obarbitone @-@ primed rat was increased from 25 % to 56 % by giving the initial &quot; calibr@@ ating &quot; dose of carbon tetrachloride at the peak of the phen@@ obarbitone @-@ induced enlargement of the li@@ ver@@ . at this point it was assumed that the cytochrome p@@ 450 / c@@ cl@@ 4 toxic state was both maximal and st@@ ab@@ le@@ . the optimal rat size to begin phen@@ obarbitone was determined as 100 g , and this size as a group had a mean maximum relative liver weight increase 47 % greater than normal rats of the same body weigh@@ t. the optimal time for the initial dose of carbon tetrachloride was after 14 days on phen@@ obarbitone .
attenuation of the lithium @-@ induced diabetes @-@ insipidus @-@ like syndrome by amiloride in rat@@ s. the effect of amiloride on lithium @-@ induced poly@@ dip@@ sia and poly@@ uria and on the lithium concentration in the plasma , brain , kidney , thyroid and red blood cells was investigated in rats , chronically treated with lic@@ l@@ . amiloride reduced the drinking and urine volume of rats in an acute ( 6 or 12 h ) and a subacute ( 3 days ) experiment . 6 h after the administration of amiloride , a reduction was observed in the lithium content of the renal medulla but not in the other organs studi@@ ed@@ . at 12 h , all the tissues showed a slight increase in lithium lev@@ el@@ s. after 3 days of combined treatment , a marked elevation in plasma and tissue lithium levels accompanied a reduction in water in@@ ta@@ ke@@ . in all the experiments , the attenuation of the lithium @-@ induced diabetes @-@ insipidus @-@ like syndrome by amiloride was accompanied by a reduction of the ratio between the lithium concentration in the renal medulla and its levels in the blood and an elevation in the plasma potassium lev@@ el@@ . it is concluded that acute amiloride administration to lithium @-@ treated patients suffering from poly@@ dip@@ sia and poly@@ uria might relieve these patients but prolonged amiloride supplementation would result in elevated lithium levels and might be hazardous .

sodium bicarbonate alleviates penile pain induced by intrac@@ avernous injections for erectile dys@@ function@@ . in an attempt to determine whether penile pain associated with intrac@@ orporeal injections could be due to the acidity of the medication , we performed a randomized study comparing the incidence of penile pain following intrac@@ orporeal injections with or without the addition of sodium bicarbonate to the intrac@@ orporeal medic@@ ation@@ s. a total of 38 consecutive patients who presented to our clinic with impotence received 0.2 m@@ l@@ . of a combination of 3 drugs : 6 m@@ g. papaverine , 100 microgram@@ s. phentolamine and 10 microgram@@ s. prostaglandin e@@ 1 with ( ph 7.@@ 05 ) or without ( ph 4.@@ 17 ) the addition of sodium bicarbonate ( 0.03 me@@ q . ) . of the 19 patients without sodium bicarbonate added to the medication 11 ( 58 % ) complained of penile pain due to the medication , while only 1 of the 19 men ( 5 % ) who received sodium bicarbonate complained of penile pain@@ . from these data we conclude that the penile pain following intrac@@ orporeal injections is most likely due to the acidity of the medication , which can be overcome by elevating the ph to a neutral level .
prospective study of the long @-@ term effects of somatostatin analog ( octreotide ) on gallbladder function and gallstone formation in chin@@ ese acromegal@@ ic patient@@ s. this article reports the changes in gallbladder function examined by ultrasonography in 20 chin@@ ese patients with active acromegaly treated with sc injection of the somatostatin analog octreotide in dosages of 300 @-@ 1500 micrograms / day for a mean of 24.2 + / - 13.9 mon@@ th@@ s. during treatment with octreotide , 17 patients developed sludge , 10 had gallstones , and 1 developed acute cholecystitis requiring surg@@ ery@@ . in all of 7 patients examined acutely , gallbladder contractility was inhibited after a single 100 @-@ micrograms injec@@ tion@@ . in 8 patients followed for 24 weeks , gallbladder contractility remained depressed throughout therap@@ y@@ . after withdrawal of octreotide in 10 patients without gallstones , 8 patients assessed had return of normal gallbladder contractility within 1 mon@@ th@@ . in 8 of the remaining 10 patients who developed gallstones during treatment , gallbladder contractility normalized in 5 patients ( 3 of whom has disappearance of their stones within 3 weeks ) , and remained depressed in 3 ( 2 of whom had stones present at 6 months ) . our results suggest that the suppression of gallbladder contractility is the cause of the successive formation of bile sludge , gallstones , and cholecystitis during octreotide therapy in chin@@ ese acromegal@@ ic patient@@ s. it is therefore very important to follow the changes of gallbladder function during long @-@ term octreotide therapy of acromegal@@ ic patients .

high incidence of primary pulmonary hypertension associated with appetite sup@@ press@@ ants in bel@@ gi@@ um@@ . primary pulmonary hypertension is a rare , progressive and incurable disease , which has been associated with the intake of appetite sup@@ press@@ ant dru@@ g@@ s. the importance of this association was evaluated in bel@@ gium while this country still had no restriction on the prescription of appetite sup@@ press@@ ant@@ s. thirty @-@ five patients with primary pulmonary hypertension and 85 matched controls were recruited over 32 months ( 1992 @-@ 1994 ) in bel@@ gi@@ um@@ . exposure to appetite @-@ sup@@ press@@ ants was assessed on the basis of hospital records and standardized interview@@ . twenty @-@ three of the patients had previously taken appetite sup@@ press@@ ants , mainly fen@@ flur@@ amines , as compared with only 5 of the controls ( 66 versus 6 % , p &lt; 0.0001 ) . five patients died before the interview , all of them had taken appetite sup@@ press@@ ant@@ s. in 8 patients the diagnosis of primary pulmonary hypertension was uncertain , 5 of them had taken appetite sup@@ press@@ ant@@ s. the patients who had been exposed to appetite sup@@ press@@ ants tended to be on average more severely ill , and to have a shorter median delay between onset of symptoms and diag@@ no@@ si@@ s. a policy of unrestricted prescription of appetite sup@@ press@@ ants may lead to a high incidence of associated primary pulmonary hyper@@ ten@@ sion@@ . intake of appetite sup@@ press@@ ants may accelerate the progression of the disease .

hemolysis of human erythrocytes induced by tamoxifen is related to disruption of membrane struc@@ ture@@ . tamoxifen ( tam ) , the anti@@ estrogenic drug most widely prescribed in the chemotherapy of breast cancer , induces changes in normal disco@@ id shape of erythrocytes and hemolytic an@@ em@@ i@@ a. this work evaluates the effects of tam on isolated human erythrocytes , attempting to identify the underlying mechanisms on tam @-@ induced hemolytic anemia and the involvement of biom@@ embran@@ es in its cytostatic action mechanis@@ m@@ s. tam induces hemolysis of erythrocytes as a function of concentr@@ ation@@ . the extension of hemolysis is variable with erythrocyte samples , but 12.5 microm tam induces total hemolysis of all tested suspen@@ sion@@ s. despite inducing extensive erythrocyte lysis , tam does not shift the osmotic fragility curves of erythro@@ cyt@@ es@@ . the hemolytic effect of tam is prevented by low concentrations of alpha @-@ tocopherol ( alpha @-@ t ) and alpha @-@ tocopherol acetate ( alpha @-@ ta@@ c ) ( inactivated functional hydroxyl ) indicating that tam @-@ induced hemolysis is not related to oxidative membrane dam@@ ag@@ e. this was further evidenced by absence of oxygen consumption and hemoglobin oxidation both determined in parallel with tam @-@ induced hem@@ ol@@ ysi@@ s. furthermore , it was observed that tam inhibits the peroxidation of human erythrocytes induced by a@@ ap@@ h , thus ruling out tam @-@ induced cell oxidative stress@@ . hemolysis caused by tam was not preceded by the leakage of k ( + ) from the cells , also excluding a colloid @-@ osmotic type mechanism of hemolysis , according to the effects on osmotic fragility curv@@ es@@ . however , tam induces release of peripheral proteins of membrane @-@ cytoskeleton and cytosol proteins essentially bound to band 3. either alpha @-@ t or alpha @-@ ta@@ c increases membrane packing and prevents tam partition into model membran@@ es@@ . these effects suggest that the protection from hemolysis by tocopher@@ ols is related to a decreased tam incorporation in condensed membranes and the structural damage of the erythrocyte membrane is consequently av@@ oide@@ d. therefore , tam @-@ induced hemolysis results from a structural perturbation of red cell membrane , leading to changes in the framework of the erythrocyte membrane and its cytoskeleton caused by its high partition in the membran@@ e. these defects explain the abnormal erythrocyte shape and decreased mechanical stability promoted by tam , resulting in hemolytic an@@ em@@ i@@ a. additionally , since membrane leakage is a final stage of cytotoxicity , the disruption of the structural characteristics of biom@@ embran@@ es by tam may contribute to the multiple mechanisms of its anticancer action .

effects of long @-@ term pretreatment with isoproterenol on bromocriptine @-@ induced tachycardia in conscious rat@@ s. it has been shown that bromocriptine @-@ induced tachycardia , which persisted after adrenalectomy , is ( i ) mediated by central dopamine d2 receptor activation and ( ii ) reduced by 5 @-@ day isoproterenol pretreatment , supporting therefore the hypothesis that this effect is dependent on sympathetic outflow to the heart@@ . this study was conducted to examine whether prolonged pretreatment with isoproterenol could abolish bromocriptine @-@ induced tachycardia in conscious rat@@ s. isoproterenol pretreatment for 15 days caused cardiac hypertrophy without affecting baseline blood pressure and heart rat@@ e. in control rats , intravenous bromocriptine ( 150 microg / kg ) induced significant hypotension and tachycardi@@ a. bromocriptine @-@ induced hypotension was unaffected by isoproterenol pretreatment , while tachycardia was reversed to significant bradycardia , an effect that was partly reduced by i.v. dom@@ peridone ( 0.5 mg / kg ) . neither cardiac vagal nor sympathetic tone was altered by isoproterenol pre@@ treat@@ ment@@ . in isolated perfused heart preparations from isoproterenol @-@ pretreated rats , the isoproterenol @-@ induced maximal increase in left ventricular systolic pressure was significantly reduced , compared with saline @-@ pretreated rats ( the ec@@ 50 of the isoproterenol @-@ induced increase in left ventricular systolic pressure was enhanced approximately 22 @-@ fold ) . these results show that 15 @-@ day isoproterenol pretreatment not only abolished but reversed bromocriptine @-@ induced tachycardia to bradycardia , an effect that is mainly related to further cardiac beta @-@ adrenoceptor desensitization rather than to impairment of autonomic regulation of the heart@@ . they suggest that , in normal conscious rats , the central tachycardia of bromocriptine appears to predominate and to mask the bradycardia of this agonist at peripheral dopamine d2 receptors .

role of xanthine oxidase in dexamethasone @-@ induced hypertension in rats . 1@@ . glucocorticoid @-@ induced hypertension ( g@@ c @-@ h@@ t ) in the rat is associated with nitric oxide @-@ redox imbalance . 2. we studied the role of xanthine oxidase ( x@@ o ) , which is implicated in the production of reactive oxygen species , in dexamethasone @-@ induced hypertension ( dex @-@ h@@ t ) . 3. thirty male sp@@ rag@@ ue @-@ d@@ aw@@ ley rats were divided randomly into four treatment groups : saline , dexamethasone ( dex ) , allopurinol plus saline , and allopurinol plus dex . 4@@ . systolic blood pressures ( s@@ bp ) and body@@ weights were recorded each alternate day@@ . thymus weight was used as a marker of glucocorticoid activity , and serum urate to assess x@@ o inhibition . 5@@ . dex increased s@@ bp ( 110 + / - 2 @-@ 126 + / - 3 mm@@ h@@ g ; p &lt; 0.001 ) and decreased thymus ( p &lt; 0.001 ) and body@@ weights ( p &quot; &lt; 0.01 ) . allopurinol decreased serum urate from 76 + / - 5 to 30 + / - 3 micromol / l ( p &lt; 0.001 ) in saline and from 84 + / - 13 to 28 + / - 2 micromol / l in dex @-@ treated ( p &lt; 0.01 ) groups . 6@@ . allopurinol did not prevent dex @-@ ht@@ . this , together with our previous findings that allopurinol failed to prevent adrenocortic@@ otrophic hormone induced hypertension , suggests that x@@ o activity is not a major determinant of g@@ c @-@ h@@ t in the rat .
extrapyramidal side effects with risperidone and haloperidol at comparable d2 receptor occupancy lev@@ el@@ s. risperidone is an antipsychotic drug with high affinity at dopamine d2 and serotonin 5 @-@ ht@@ 2 recep@@ tor@@ s. previous clinical studies have proposed that risperidone &apos;s pharmacologic profile may produce improved efficacy for negative psychotic symptoms and decreased propensity for extrapyramidal side effects ; features shared by so @-@ called &apos; atypical &apos; neurolep@@ tic@@ s. to determine if routine risperidone treatment is associated with a unique degree of d2 receptor occupancy and pattern of clinical effects , we used &#91; 123@@ i &#93; ib@@ z@@ m spec@@ t to determine d2 occupancy in subjects treated with routine clinical doses of risperidone ( n = 12 ) or haloperidol ( n = 7 ) . both risperidone and haloperidol produced d2 occupancy levels between approximately 60 and 90 % at standard clinical dos@@ es@@ . there was no significant difference between occupancy levels obtained with haloperidol or ris@@ perid@@ on@@ e. drug @-@ induced parkinsonism was observed in subjects treated with risperidone ( 42 % ) and haloperidol ( 29 % ) and was observed at occupancy levels above 60 % . based on these observations , it is concluded that 5 @-@ ht@@ 2 blockade obtained with risperidone at d2 occupancy rates of 60 % and above does not appear to protect against the risk for extrapyramidal side effects .

oral manifestations of &quot; meth mouth &quot; : a case repor@@ t. aim : the aim of the documentation of this clinical case is to make clinicians aware of &quot; meth mouth &quot; and the medical risks associated with this serious condi@@ tion@@ . background : methamphetamine is a very addictive , powerful stimulant that increases wakefulness and physical activity and can produce other effects such as cardiac dys@@ rhyth@@ mias , hypertension , hallucinations , and violent behavi@@ or@@ . dental patients ab@@ using methamphetamine can present with poor oral hygiene , xer@@ ostomia , r@@ amp@@ ant caries ( &quot; meth mouth &quot; ) , and excessive tooth w@@ ear@@ . oral rehabilitation of patients using methamphetamine can be challeng@@ ing@@ . case description : a 30 @-@ year @-@ old ca@@ uc@@ asian woman presented with dental pain , bad breath , and self @-@ reported poor es@@ the@@ tic@@ s. a comprehensive examination including her medical history , panoramic radiograph , and intraoral examination revealed 19 carious lesions , which is not very common for a healthy adul@@ t. she reported her use of methamphetamine for five years and had not experienced any major carious episodes before she started using the dru@@ g. summary : the patient &apos;s medical and dental histories along with radiographic and clinical findings lead to a diagnosis of &quot; meth mouth . &quot; although three different dental treatment modalities ( either conventional or implant @-@ supported ) have been offered to the patient since aug@@ ust 2007 , the patient has yet to initiate any treat@@ ment@@ . clinical significance : this clinical case showing oral manifestations of meth mouth was presented to help dental practitioners recognize and manage patients who may be ab@@ using meth@@ amph@@ et@@ amin@@ es@@ . dental practitioners also may be sk@@ ep@@ tical about the reliability of appointment keeping by these patients , as they frequently miss their appointments without reasonable justification .
thyroxine abuse : an unusual case of thyrotoxicosis in pregn@@ anc@@ y@@ . eating disorders and the associated behavioural problems and drug abuse are uncommon in pregn@@ anc@@ y@@ . when they do occur they are often unrecognized because of den@@ ial but when significant may pose a risk to both the mother and her fet@@ us@@ . this case illustrates a number of problems that may be encountered in women with eating disorders in pregnancy , including prolonged and recurrent metabolic disturbances and diuretic ab@@ use@@ . in particular it illustrates the derangements of thyroid function seen in pregnant women with eating disorders and remin@@ ds us that when a cause for thyrotoxicosis remains obscure , thyroxine abuse should be considered and explored .
attenuation of methamphetamine @-@ induced nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurotoxicity in mice by lipopolysaccharide pre@@ treat@@ ment@@ . immunological activation has been proposed to play a role in methamphetamine @-@ induced dopaminergic terminal dam@@ ag@@ e. in this study , we examined the roles of lipopolysaccharide , a pro @-@ inflammatory and inflammatory factor , treatment in modulating the methamphetamine @-@ induced nigrostriatal dopamine neuro@@ toxic@@ it@@ y@@ . lipopolysaccharide pretreatment did not affect the basal body temperature or methamphetamine @-@ elicited hyperthermia three days later@@ . such systemic lipopolysaccharide treatment mitigated methamphetamine @-@ induced striatal dopamine and 3,4 @-@ dihydroxy@@ phenylacetic acid depl@@ e@@ tions in a dose @-@ dependent man@@ ner@@ . as the most potent dose ( 1 mg / kg ) of lipopolysaccharide was administered two weeks , one day before or after the methamphetamine dosing regimen , methamphetamine @-@ induced striatal dopamine and 3,4 @-@ dihydroxy@@ phenylacetic acid depl@@ e@@ tions remained un@@ al@@ te@@ red@@ . moreover , systemic lipopolysaccharide pretreatment ( 1 mg / kg ) attenuated local methamphetamine infusion @-@ produced dopamine and 3,4 @-@ dihydroxy@@ phenylacetic acid depl@@ e@@ tions in the striatum , indicating that the protective effect of lipopolysaccharide is less likely due to interrupted peripheral distribution or metabolism of meth@@ amph@@ et@@ amin@@ e. we concluded a critical time window for systemic lipopolysaccharide pretreatment in exerting effective protection against methamphetamine @-@ induced nigrostriatal dopamine neurotoxicity .
effect of converting enzyme inhibition on the course of adriamycin @-@ induced nephro@@ path@@ y@@ . the effect of the converting enzyme inhibitor ( ce@@ i ) enalapril was assessed in mun@@ ich @-@ w@@ istar rats with established adriamycin nephro@@ si@@ s. rats were given a single dose of adriamycin and one month later divided into four groups matched for albuminuria , blood pressure , and plasma albumin concentr@@ ation@@ . groups 1 and 3 remained untreated while groups 2 and 4 received enal@@ ap@@ ril@@ . groups 1 and 2 underwent micro@@ puncture studies after 10 day@@ s. these short @-@ term studies showed that enalapril reduced arterial blood pressure ( 101 + / - 2 vs. 124 + / - 3 mm h@@ g , group 2 vs. 1 , p less than 0.05 ) and glomerular capillary pressure ( 54 + / - 1 vs. 61 + / - 2 mm h@@ g , p less than 0.05 ) without reducing albuminuria ( 6@@ 17 + / - 50 vs. 570 + / - 47 mg / day ) or g@@ fr ( 1.03 + / - 0.04 vs. 1.04 + / - 0.11 ml / min ) . groups 3 and 4 were studied at four and at six months to assess the effect of enalapril on progression of renal injury in adriamycin nephro@@ si@@ s. chronic enalapril treatment reduced blood pressure without reducing albuminuria in group 4@@ . untreated group 3 rats exhibited a progressive reduction in g@@ fr ( 0.35 + / - 0.08 ml / min at 4 months , 0.27 + / - 0.07 ml / min at 6 months ) . enalapril treatment blunted but did not prevent reduction in g@@ fr in group 4 ( 0.86 + / - 0.15 ml / min at 4 months , 0.69 + / - 0.13 ml / min at 6 months , both p less than 0.05 vs. group 3 ) . reduction in g@@ fr was associated with the development of glomerular sclerosis in both treated and untreated rats .

effects of calcium channel blockers on bupivacaine @-@ induced toxic@@ it@@ y@@ . the purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of calcium channel blockers on bupivacaine @-@ induced acute toxic@@ it@@ y@@ . for each of the three tested calcium channel blockers ( diltiazem , verapamil and b@@ epri@@ dil ) 6 groups of mice were treated by two different doses , i.e. 2 and 10 mg / kg / i.p. , or an equal volume of saline for the control group ( n = 20 ) ; 15 minutes later , all the animals were injected with a single 50 mg / kg / i.p. dose of bup@@ ivac@@ ain@@ e. the convulsant activity , the time of latency to convul@@ se and the mortality rate were assessed in each grou@@ p. the local anesthetic @-@ induced mortality was significantly increased by the three different calcium channel bloc@@ ker@@ s. the convulsant activity of bupivacaine was not significantly modified but calcium channel blockers decreased the time of latency to obtain bupivacaine @-@ induced convulsions ; this effect was less pronounced with b@@ epri@@ dil .
sel@@ eg@@ iline @-@ induced postural hypotension in parkin@@ son &apos;s disease : a longitudinal study on the effects of drug withdraw@@ al@@ . objectives : the un@@ ited k@@ ingdom parkin@@ son &apos;s disease research group ( uk@@ p@@ dr@@ g ) trial found an increased mortality in patients with parkin@@ son &apos;s disease ( p@@ d ) randomized to receive 10 mg sel@@ eg@@ iline per day and l @-@ dopa compared with those taking l @-@ dopa al@@ on@@ e. recently , we found that therapy with sel@@ eg@@ iline and l @-@ dopa was associated with selective systolic orthostatic hypotension which was abolished by withdrawal of sel@@ eg@@ il@@ ine@@ . this unwanted effect on postural blood pressure was not the result of underlying autonomic fail@@ ure@@ . the aims of this study were to confirm our previous findings in a separate cohort of patients and to determine the time course of the cardiovascular consequences of stopping sel@@ eg@@ iline in the expectation that this might shed light on the mechanisms by which the drug causes orthostatic hypot@@ en@@ sion@@ . methods : the cardiovascular responses to standing and head @-@ up tilt were studied repeatedly in p@@ d patients receiving sel@@ eg@@ iline and as the drug was withdraw@@ n@@ . results : head @-@ up tilt caused systolic orthostatic hypotension which was marked in six of 20 p@@ d patients on sel@@ eg@@ iline , one of whom lost consciousness with un@@ recor@@ d@@ able blood pres@@ su@@ res@@ . a lesser degree of orthostatic hypotension occurred with stand@@ ing@@ . orthostatic hypotension was ameliorated 4 days after withdrawal of sel@@ eg@@ iline and totally abolished 7 days after discontinuation of the dru@@ g. stopping sel@@ eg@@ iline also significantly reduced the supine systolic and diastolic blood pressures consistent with a previously undescribed supine pressor action@@ . conclusion : this study confirms our previous finding that sel@@ eg@@ iline in combination with l @-@ dopa is associated with selective orthostatic hypot@@ en@@ sion@@ . the possibilities that these cardiovascular findings might be the result of non @-@ selective inhibition of monoamine oxidase or of amphetamine and met@@ amphetamine are discussed .
explicit episodic memory for sensory @-@ discriminative components of capsaicin @-@ induced pain : immediate and delayed r@@ atin@@ g@@ s. pain memory is thought to affect future pain sensitivity and thus contribute to clinical pain condi@@ tion@@ s. systematic investigations of the human capacity to remember sensory features of experimental pain are spar@@ se@@ . in order to address long @-@ term pain memory , nine healthy male volunteers received intradermal injections of three doses of capsaicin ( 0.05 , 1 and 20 microg , separated by 15 min breaks ) , each given three times in a balanced design across three sessions at one week inter@@ val@@ s. pain rating was performed using a computerized visual analogue scale ( 0 @-@ 100 ) digitized at 1 / s , either immediately online or one hour or one day after injec@@ tion@@ . subjects also recalled their pains one week later@@ . capsaicin injection reliably induced a dose @-@ dependent flare ( p &lt; 0.001 ) without any difference within or across ses@@ sion@@ s. the strong burning pain decayed exponentially within a few min@@ ut@@ es@@ . subjects were able to reliably discriminate pain magnitude and duration across capsaicin doses ( both p &lt; 0.001 ) , regardless of whether first @-@ time ratings were requested immediately , after one hour or after one day@@ . pain recall after one week was similarly precise ( magnitude : p &lt; 0.01 , duration : p &lt; 0.05 ) . correlation with rating recall after one week was best when first @-@ time ratings were requested as late as one day after injection ( r ( 2 ) = 0.79 ) indicating that both rating retriev@@ als utilized similar memory trac@@ es@@ . these results indicate a reliable memory for magnitude and duration of experimentally induced pain@@ . the data further suggest that the consolidation of this memory is an important interim stage , and may take up to one day .
reversibility of captopril @-@ induced renal insufficiency after prolonged use in an unusual case of renovascular hyper@@ ten@@ sion@@ . we report a case of severe hypertension with an occluded renal artery to a solitary kidney , who developed sudden deterioration of renal function following treatment with captop@@ ril@@ . his renal function remained impaired but stable during 2 years &apos; treatment with captopril but returned to pre @-@ treatment levels soon after cessation of the dru@@ g. this indicates reversibility in captopril @-@ induced renal failure even after its prolonged use and suggests that no organic damage occurs to glomerular arterioles following chronic ace inhibition .
liver disease caused by propyl@@ thiour@@ ac@@ il@@ . this report presents the clinical , laboratory , and light and electron microscopic observations on a patient with chronic active ( aggressive ) hepatitis caused by the administration of propyl@@ thiour@@ ac@@ il@@ . this is an addition to the list of drugs that must be considered in the evaluation of chronic liver disease .
capsaicin @-@ induced muscle pain alters the excitability of the human jaw @-@ stretch reflex@@ . the pathophysiology of painful temporomandibular disorders is not fully understood , but evidence suggests that muscle pain modulates motor function in characteristic w@@ ay@@ s. this study tested the hypothesis that activation of nociceptive muscle afferent fibers would be linked to an increased excitability of the human jaw @-@ stretch reflex and whether this process would be sensitive to length and velocity of the stret@@ ch@@ . capsaicin ( 10 micro g ) was injected into the masseter muscle to induce pain in 11 healthy volunte@@ er@@ s. short @-@ latency reflex responses were evoked in the masseter and tempor@@ alis muscles by a stretch device with different velocities and displacements before , during , and after the pain@@ . the normalized reflex amplitude increased with an increase in velocity at a given displacement , but remained constant with different displacements at a given vel@@ oc@@ it@@ y@@ . the normalized reflex amplitude was significantly higher during pain , but only at faster stretches in the painful mus@@ cle@@ . increased sensitivity of the fusi@@ motor system during acute muscle pain could be one likely mechanism to explain the findings .
repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for levodopa @-@ induced dys@@ kine@@ sias in parkin@@ son &apos;s dise@@ as@@ e. in a placebo @-@ controlled , single @-@ blinded , crossover study , we assessed the effect of &quot; real &quot; repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation ( rt@@ ms ) versus &quot; sham &quot; rt@@ ms ( placebo ) on peak dose dys@@ kine@@ sias in patients with parkin@@ son &apos;s disease ( p@@ d ) . ten patients with p@@ d and prominent dys@@ kine@@ sias had rt@@ ms ( 1,@@ 800 pulses ; 1 h@@ z rate ) delivered over the motor cortex for 4 consecutive days twice , once real stimuli and once sham stimulation were used ; evaluations were done at the baseline and 1 day after the end of each of the treatment ser@@ i@@ es@@ . direct comparison between sham and real rt@@ ms effects showed no significant difference in clinician @-@ assessed dyskinesia sever@@ it@@ y@@ . however , comparison with the baseline showed small but significant reduction in dyskinesia severity following real rt@@ ms but not plac@@ e@@ bo@@ . the major effect was on dystonia sub@@ sco@@ re@@ . similarly , in patient diaries , although both treatments caused reduction in subjective dyskinesia scores during the days of intervention , the effect was sustained for 3 days after the intervention for the real rt@@ ms on@@ ly@@ . following rt@@ ms , no side effects and no adverse effects on motor function and p@@ d symptoms were not@@ ed@@ . the results suggest the existence of residual beneficial clinical af@@ tere@@ ff@@ ects of consecutive daily applications of low @-@ frequency rt@@ ms on dys@@ kine@@ sias in p@@ d. the effects may be further exploited for potential therapeutic uses .
dis@@ ul@@ fir@@ am @-@ like syndrome after hydrogen cyan@@ amide professional skin exposure : two case reports in fr@@ anc@@ e. hydrogen cyan@@ amide is a plant growth regulator used in agriculture to induce bud break in fruit tre@@ es@@ . contact with the skin can result in percutaneous absorption of the substance that inhibits aldehyde dehydrogenase and can induce acetaldehyde syndrome in case of alcohol use@@ . the purpose of this report is to describe two cases of a dis@@ ul@@ fir@@ am @-@ like syndrome following occupational exposure to hydrogen cyan@@ am@@ ide@@ . the first case involved a 59 @-@ year @-@ old man who used dor@@ me@@ x , which contains hydrogen cyan@@ amide , without protection after consuming a large amount of alcohol during a me@@ al@@ . in less than 1 hour after the ingestion of alcohol , he developed mal@@ aise with flushing of the face , tachycardia , and dysp@@ ne@@ a. manifestations regressed spontaneously under surveillance in the hospit@@ al@@ . the second case occurred in a 55 @-@ year @-@ old far@@ mer following cutaneous contact with dorm@@ ex@@ . five hours after exposure , he developed dis@@ ul@@ fir@@ am @-@ like syndrome with flushing , tachycardia , and arterial hypotension after consuming three glasses of w@@ ine@@ . the patient recovered spontaneously in 3 hours under surveillance in the hospit@@ al@@ . these cases confirm the necessity of avoiding alcohol consumption as recommended in the instructions for use of dor@@ me@@ x and of preventing cutaneous contact during use .
repeated trim@@ i@@ pramine induces dopamine d2 / d@@ 3 and alpha1 @-@ adrenergic up @-@ regul@@ ation@@ . trim@@ i@@ pramine ( tri ) , which shows a clinical antidepressant activity , is chemically related to imipramine but does not inhibit the reuptake of noradrenaline and 5 @-@ hydroxytryptamine , nor does it induce beta @-@ adrenergic down @-@ regul@@ ation@@ . the mechanism of its antidepressant activity is still un@@ know@@ n@@ . the aim of the present study was to find out whether tri given repeatedly was able to induce adaptive changes in the dopaminergic and alpha1 @-@ adrenergic systems , demonstrated by us previously for various antidepress@@ ant@@ s. tri was given to male w@@ istar rats and male albino sw@@ iss mice per@@ orally twice daily for 14 day@@ s. in the acute experiment tri ( given i.p. ) does not antagonize the reserpine hypothermia in mice and does not potentiate the 5 @-@ hydroxy@@ tryptophan head tw@@ it@@ ches in rat@@ s. tri given repeatedly to rats increases the locomotor hyperactivity induced by d @-@ amphetamine , quin@@ pi@@ role and ( + ) -7 @-@ hydroxy @-@ di@@ pro@@ py@@ lo@@ amin@@ ot@@ etr@@ alin ( dopamine d2 and d@@ 3 effects ) . the stere@@ otyp@@ ies induced by d @-@ amphetamine or apomorphine are not potentiated by tri@@ . it increases the behaviour stimulation evoked by phenylephrine ( given intrav@@ entr@@ icul@@ arly ) in rats , evaluated in the open field test as well as the aggressiveness evoked by clonidine in mice , both these effects being mediated by an alpha1 @-@ adrenergic recep@@ tor@@ . it may be concluded that , like other tricyclic antidepressants studied previously , tri given repeatedly increases the responsiveness of brain dopamine d2 and d@@ 3 ( locomotor activity but not stere@@ otypy ) as well as alpha1 @-@ adrenergic receptors to their agon@@ ist@@ s. a question arises whether the reuptake inhibition is of any importance to the adaptive changes induced by repeated antidepressants , suggested to be responsible for the antidepressant activity .
ranitidine @-@ induced acute interstitial nephritis in a cadaveric renal all@@ ogra@@ ft@@ . ranitidine frequently is used for preventing peptic ulceration after renal transpl@@ ant@@ ation@@ . this drug occasionally has been associated with acute interstitial nephritis in native kidne@@ ys@@ . there are no similar reports with renal transpl@@ ant@@ ation@@ . we report a case of ranitidine @-@ induced acute interstitial nephritis in a recipient of a cadaveric renal allograft presenting with acute allograft dysfunction within 48 hours of exposure to the dru@@ g. the biopsy specimen showed pathogn@@ om@@ onic features , including eosinophilic infiltration of the interstitial compartment@@ . allograft function improved rapidly and returned to baseline after stopping the drug .
late , late doxorubicin cardi@@ otoxic@@ it@@ y@@ . cardiac toxicity is a major complication which limits the use of adriamycin as a chemotherapeutic ag@@ ent@@ . cardiomyopathy is frequent when the total dose exceeds 600 mg / m2 and occurs within one to six months after cessation of therap@@ y@@ . a patient is reported who developed progressive cardiomyopathy two and one @-@ half years after receiving 580 mg / m2 which apparently represents late , late cardiotoxicity .
acetazolamide @-@ induced nephro@@ lithiasis : implications for treatment of neuromuscular dis@@ or@@ der@@ s. carbonic anhydrase inhibitors can cause nephro@@ lithi@@ asi@@ s. we studied 20 patients receiving long @-@ term carbonic anhydrase inhibitor treatment for periodic paralysis and myot@@ oni@@ a. three patients on acetazolamide ( 15 % ) developed renal calcul@@ i. extracorporeal lithotripsy successfully removed a renal calculus in one patient and surgery removed a stag@@ horn calculus in another , permitting continued treat@@ ment@@ . renal function remained normal in all patient@@ s. nephro@@ lithiasis is a complication of acetazolamide but does not preclude its use .
is the treatment of sc@@ abies hazardous ? treatment for sc@@ abies is usually initiated by general practitioners ; most consider lin@@ dane ( gamma benzene hex@@ ach@@ loride ) the treatment of cho@@ ic@@ e. lin@@ dane is also widely used as an agricultural and industrial pesticide , and as a result the toxic profile of this insecticide is well underst@@ o@@ od@@ . evidence is accumulating that lin@@ dane can be toxic to the central nervous system and may be associated with aplastic ana@@ em@@ i@@ a. preparations containing lin@@ dane continue to be sold over the counter and may represent a hazard to poorly informed patient@@ s. this literature review suggests that general practitioners should prescribe sc@@ ab@@ icides with increased caution for certain at @-@ risk groups , and give adequate war@@ nings regarding potential toxicity .

5 @-@ az@@ acy@@ tidine potentiates initiation induced by carcinogens in rat li@@ ver@@ . to test the validity of the hypothesis that hyp@@ omethylation of d@@ na plays an important role in the initiation of carcinogenic process , 5 @-@ az@@ acy@@ tidine ( 5 @-@ az@@ c ) ( 10 mg / kg ) , an inhibitor of d@@ na methylation , was given to rats during the phase of repair synthesis induced by the three carcinogens , benzo &#91; a &#93; -@@ pyrene ( 200 mg / kg ) , n @-@ methyl @-@ n @-@ nitrosourea ( 60 mg / kg ) and 1,2 @-@ dimethyl@@ hydrazine ( 1,2 @-@ dm@@ h ) ( 100 mg / kg ) . the initiated hepatocytes in the liver were assayed as the gamma @-@ glutam@@ yltransferase ( gamma @-@ gt ) positive foci formed following a 2 @-@ week selection regimen consisting of dietary 0.02 % 2 @-@ acetyl@@ amino@@ fluorene coupled with a necro@@ genic dose of c@@ cl@@ 4@@ . the results obtained indicate that with all three carcinogens , administration of 5 @-@ az@@ c during repair synthesis increased the incidence of initiated hepatocytes , for example 10 @-@ 20 foci / cm2 in 5 @-@ az@@ c and carcinogen @-@ treated rats compared with 3 @-@ 5 foci / cm2 in rats treated with carcinogen on@@ ly@@ . administration of &#91; 3@@ h &#93; -5 @-@ az@@ ade@@ oxy@@ cytidine during the repair synthesis induced by 1,2 @-@ dm@@ h further showed that 0.019 mol % of cytosine residues in d@@ na were substituted by the analogue , indicating that incorporation of 5 @-@ az@@ c occurs during repair synthesi@@ s. in the absence of the carcinogen , 5 @-@ az@@ c given after a two thirds partial hepatectomy , when its incorporation should be maximum , failed to induce any gamma @-@ gt positive f@@ oci@@ . the results suggest that hyp@@ omethylation of d@@ na per se may not be sufficient for initi@@ ation@@ . perhaps two events might be necessary for initiation , the first caused by the carcinogen and a second involving hyp@@ omethylation of d@@ na .

haemolytic @-@ ur@@ aemic syndrome after treatment with metr@@ on@@ id@@ azol@@ e. this paper describes the clinical features of six children who developed the haemolytic @-@ ur@@ aemic syndrome after treatment with metr@@ on@@ id@@ azol@@ e. these children were older and were more likely to have undergone recent bowel surgery than are other children with this condi@@ tion@@ . while the involvement of metronidazole in the aetiology of the haemolytic @-@ ur@@ aemic syndrome is not established firmly , the action of this drug in sensitizing tissues to oxidation injury and the reported evidence of oxidation changes in the haemolytic @-@ ur@@ aemic syndrome suggest a possible link between metronidazole treatment and some cases of the haemolytic @-@ ur@@ aemic syndrome .
risk factors of sensorineural hearing loss in preterm inf@@ ant@@ s. among 5@@ 47 preterm infants of &lt; or = 34 weeks gestation born between 1987 and 1991 , 8 children ( 1.46 % ) developed severe progressive and bilateral sensorineural hearing los@@ s. perinatal risk factors of infants with hearing loss were compared with those of two control groups matched for gestation and birth weight and for perinatal complic@@ ation@@ s. our observations demonstrated an association of hearing loss with a higher incidence of perinatal complic@@ ation@@ s. ot@@ otoxicity appeared closely related to a prolonged administration and higher total dose of ot@@ otoxic drugs , particularly aminoglycosides and furo@@ sem@@ ide@@ . finally , we strongly recommend to prospectively and regularly perform audi@@ ologic assessment in sick preterm children as hearing loss is of delayed onset and in most cases bilateral and severe .

different lobular distributions of altered hepatocyte tight junctions in rat models of intrahepatic and extrahepatic cholest@@ asi@@ s. hepatocyte tight junctions ( t@@ j@@ s ) , the only intercellular barrier between the sinusoidal and the canalicular spaces , play a key role in bile form@@ ation@@ . although hepatocyte t@@ j@@ s are impaired in cholestasis , attempts to localize the precise site of hepatocyte t@@ j damage by freeze @-@ fracture electron microscopy have produced limited inform@@ ation@@ . recently , several t@@ j @-@ associated proteins like z@@ o @-@ 1 and 7@@ h@@ 6 have been identified and character@@ iz@@ ed@@ . immun@@ olocalization of 7@@ h@@ 6 appears to closely correlate with paracellular permeabil@@ it@@ y@@ . we used rat models of intrahepatic cholestasis by eth@@ inyl estradiol ( ee ) treatment and extrahepatic cholestasis by bile duct ligation ( b@@ dl ) to precisely determine the site of t@@ j dam@@ ag@@ e. alterations in hepatocyte t@@ j@@ s were assessed by double @-@ immunolab@@ eling for 7@@ h@@ 6 and z@@ o @-@ 1 using a confocal laser scanning microscop@@ e. in control rats , immunostaining for 7@@ h@@ 6 and z@@ o @-@ 1 colocalized to outline bile canal@@ iculi in a continuous fash@@ ion@@ . in contrast , 7@@ h@@ 6 and z@@ o @-@ 1 immunostaining was more discontinuous , out@@ lining the bile canal@@ iculi after b@@ dl@@ . immunostaining for 7@@ h@@ 6 , not z@@ o @-@ 1 , decreased and predominantly appeared as discrete signals in the sub@@ membranous cytoplasm of peri@@ portal hepatocytes after b@@ dl@@ . after ee treatment , changes in immunostaining for 7@@ h@@ 6 and z@@ o @-@ 1 were similar to those seen in peri@@ portal hepatocytes after b@@ dl , but distributed more diffusely throughout the lob@@ ul@@ e. this study is the first to demonstrate that impairment of hepatocyte t@@ j@@ s occurs heter@@ ogenously in the liver lobule after b@@ dl and suggests that b@@ dl and ee treatments produce different lobular distributions of increased paracellular permeability .

neurotoxicity of halogenated hydroxy@@ quinol@@ ines : clinical analysis of cases reported outside j@@ ap@@ an@@ . an analysis is presented of 220 cases of possible neurotoxic reactions to halogenated hydroxy@@ quinol@@ ines reported from outside j@@ ap@@ an@@ . in 80 cases insufficient information was available for adequate comment and in 29 a relationship to the administration of cl@@ io@@ quinol could be exclu@@ de@@ d. of the remainder , a relationship to cl@@ io@@ quinol was considered probable in 42 and possible in 69 cas@@ es@@ . in six of the probable cases the neurological disturbance consisted of an acute reversible encephalopathy usually related to the ingestion of a high dose of cl@@ io@@ quinol over a short period@@ . the most common manifestation , observed in 15 further cases , was isolated optic atroph@@ y@@ . this was most frequently found in children , many of whom had received cl@@ io@@ quinol as treatment for acro@@ dermatitis enter@@ opath@@ ic@@ a. in the remaining cases , a combination of myelopathy , visual disturbance , and peripheral neuropathy was the most common manifest@@ ation@@ . isolated myelopathy or peripheral neuropathy , or these manifestations occurring together , were infrequ@@ ent@@ . the onset of all manifestations ( except toxic encephalopathy ) was usually subacute , with subsequent partial recover@@ y@@ . older subjects tended to display more side effec@@ ts@@ . the full syndrome of subacute myel@@ o @-@ optic neuropathy was more frequent in women , but they tended to have taken greater quantities of the drug .
epileptic seizures following cortical application of fibrin seal@@ ants containing tranexamic acid in rat@@ s. background : fibrin seal@@ ants ( fs ) derived from human plasma are frequently used in neuro@@ surg@@ ery@@ . in order to increase clot stability , fs typically contain aprotinin , a natural fibrinolysis inhibit@@ or@@ . recently , synthetic fibrinolysis inhibitors such as tranexamic acid ( tam@@ ca ) have been considered as substitutes for apro@@ tin@@ in@@ . however , tam@@ ca has been shown to cause epileptic seiz@@ u@@ res@@ . we wanted to study whether tam@@ ca retains its convulsive action if incorporated into a f@@ s. method : fs containing aprotinin or different concentrations of tam@@ ca ( 0.5 @-@ 47.5 mg / ml ) were applied to the pial surface of the cortex of anaesthetized rat@@ s. the response of the animals was evaluated using electroencephalography and by monitoring the clinical behaviour during and after recovery from anaes@@ thesi@@ a. findings : fs containing tam@@ ca caused paroxysmal brain activity which was associated with distinct convulsive behavi@@ our@@ s. the degree of these seizures increased with increasing concentration of tam@@ ca@@ . thus , fs containing 47.5 mg / ml tam@@ ca evoked generalized seizures in all tested rats ( n = 6 ) while the lowest concentration of tam@@ ca ( 0.5 mg / ml ) only evoked brief episodes of jer@@ k @-@ correlated convulsive potentials in 1 of 6 rat@@ s. in contrast , fs containing aprotinin did not evoke any paroxysmal activ@@ it@@ y@@ . interpretation : tranexamic acid retains its convulsive action within f@@ s. thus , use of fs containing tam@@ ca for surgery within or close to the c@@ ns may pose a substantial risk to the patient .
a diet promoting sugar dependency causes behavioral cross @-@ sensitization to a low dose of amph@@ et@@ amin@@ e. previous research in this laboratory has shown that a diet of intermittent excessive sugar consumption produces a state with neurochemical and behavioral similarities to drug depend@@ enc@@ y@@ . the present study examined whether female rats on various regimens of sugar access would show behavioral cross @-@ sensitization to a low dose of amph@@ et@@ amin@@ e. after a 30 @-@ min baseline measure of locomotor activity ( day 0 ) , animals were maintained on a cyclic diet of 12 @-@ h deprivation followed by 12 @-@ h access to 10 % sucrose solution and chow pellets ( 12 h access starting 4 h after onset of the dark period ) for 21 day@@ s. locomotor activity was measured again for 30 min at the beginning of days 1 and 21 of sugar access@@ . beginning on day 22 , all rats were maintained on ad libitum ch@@ ow@@ . nine days later locomotor activity was measured in response to a single low dose of amphetamine ( 0.5 mg / kg ) . the animals that had experienced cyclic sucrose and chow were hyperactive in response to amphetamine compared with four control groups ( ad libitum 10 % sucrose and chow followed by amphetamine injection , cyclic chow followed by amphetamine injection , ad libitum chow with amphetamine , or cyclic 10 % sucrose and chow with a saline injection ) . these results suggest that a diet comprised of alternating deprivation and access to a sugar solution and chow produces b@@ ing@@ eing on sugar that leads to a long lasting state of increased sensitivity to amphetamine , possibly due to a lasting alteration in the dopamine system .

brain natriuretic peptide is a predictor of anthracycline @-@ induced cardi@@ otoxic@@ it@@ y@@ . anthracyclines are effective antineoplastic drugs , but they frequently cause dose @-@ related cardi@@ otoxic@@ it@@ y@@ . the cardiotoxicity of conventional anthracycline therapy highlights a need to search for methods that are highly sensitive and capable of predicting cardiac dys@@ function@@ . we measured the plasma level of brain natriuretic peptide ( b@@ n@@ p ) to determine whether b@@ n@@ p might serve as a simple diagnostic indicator of anthracycline @-@ induced cardiotoxicity in patients with acute leukemia treated with a daunorubicin ( dn@@ r ) -containing reg@@ im@@ en@@ . thirteen patients with acute leukemia were treated with a dn@@ r @-@ containing reg@@ im@@ en@@ . cardiac functions were evaluated with radionuclide angiography before chemo@@ therap@@ i@@ es@@ . the plasma levels of atrial natriuretic peptide ( an@@ p ) and b@@ n@@ p were measured at the time of radionuclide angi@@ og@@ rap@@ hy@@ . three patients developed congestive heart failure after the completion of chemo@@ therap@@ y@@ . five patients were diagnosed as having subclinical heart failure after the completion of chemo@@ therap@@ y@@ . the plasma levels of b@@ n@@ p in all the patients with clinical and subclinical heart failure increased above the normal limit ( 40 pg / ml ) before the detection of clinical or subclinical heart failure by radionuclide angi@@ og@@ rap@@ hy@@ . on the other hand , b@@ n@@ p did not increase in the patients without heart failure given dn@@ r , even at more than 700 mg / m ( 2 ) . the plasma level of an@@ p did not always increase in all the patients with clinical and subclinical heart fail@@ ure@@ . these preliminary results suggest that b@@ n@@ p may be useful as an early and sensitive indicator of anthracycline @-@ induced cardiotoxicity .

alpha @-@ lipoic acid prevents mitochondrial damage and neurotoxicity in experimental chemotherapy neuro@@ path@@ y@@ . the study investigates if alpha @-@ lipoic acid is neuroprotective against chemotherapy induced neurotoxicity , if mitochondrial damage plays a critical role in toxic neurodegenerative cascade , and if neuroprotective effects of alpha @-@ lipoic acid depend on mitochondria protec@@ tion@@ . we used an in vitro model of chemotherapy induced peripheral neuropathy that closely mimic the in vivo condition by exposing primary cultures of dorsal root ganglion ( dr@@ g ) sensory neurons to paclitaxel and cisplatin , two widely used and highly effective chemotherapeutic dru@@ g@@ s. this approach allowed investigating the efficacy of alpha @-@ lipoic acid in preventing axonal damage and apoptosis and the function and ultrastructural morphology of mitochondria after exposure to toxic agents and alpha @-@ lipoic acid@@ . our results demonstrate that both cisplatin and paclitaxel cause early mitochondrial impairment with loss of membrane potential and induction of autophagic vacuoles in neuron@@ s. alpha @-@ lipoic acid exerts neuroprotective effects against chemotherapy induced neurotoxicity in sensory neurons : it rescues the mitochondrial toxicity and induces the expression of fr@@ atax@@ in , an essential mitochondrial protein with anti @-@ oxidant and chaperone proper@@ ti@@ es@@ . in conclusion mitochondrial toxicity is an early common event both in paclitaxel and cisplatin induced neuro@@ toxic@@ it@@ y@@ . alpha @-@ lipoic acid protects sensory neurons through its anti @-@ oxidant and mitochondrial regulatory functions , possibly inducing the expression of fr@@ atax@@ in@@ . these findings suggest that alpha @-@ lipoic acid might reduce the risk of developing peripheral nerve toxicity in patients undergoing chemotherapy and encourage further confirmatory clinical trials .
optim@@ ising stroke prevention in non @-@ valvular atrial fibrill@@ ation@@ . atrial fibrillation is associated with substantial morbidity and mortal@@ it@@ y@@ . pooled data from trials comparing antithrombotic treatment with placebo have shown that warfarin reduces the risk of stroke by 62 % , and that aspirin alone reduces the risk by 22 % . overall , in high @-@ risk patients , warfarin is superior to aspirin in preventing strokes , with a relative risk reduction of 36 % . xim@@ el@@ ag@@ atran , an oral direct thrombin inhibitor , was found to be as efficient as vitamin k antagonist drugs in the prevention of embolic events , but has been recently withdrawn because of abnormal liver function test@@ s. the active @-@ w ( atrial fibrillation clopidogrel trial with ir@@ bes@@ artan for prevention of vascular events ) study has demonstrated that warfarin is superior to platelet therapy ( clopidogrel plus aspirin ) in the prevention af embolic event@@ s. id@@ rap@@ ar@@ in@@ u@@ x , a factor x@@ a inhibitor , is being evaluated in patients with atrial fibrill@@ ation@@ . angiotensin @-@ converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin ii receptor @-@ blocking drugs hold promise in atrial fibrillation through cardiac re@@ mod@@ ell@@ ing@@ . preliminary studies suggest that statins could interfere with the risk of recurrence after electrical cardiover@@ sion@@ . finally , percutaneous methods for the exclusion of left atrial appendage are under investigation in high @-@ risk patients .

the hematologic effects of cef@@ on@@ ic@@ id and cef@@ az@@ ed@@ one in the dog : a potential model of cephalosporin hemat@@ otoxicity in man@@ . cephalosporin antibiotics cause a variety of hematologic disturbances in man , the path@@ ogen@@ eses and hemat@@ opathology of which remain poorly character@@ iz@@ ed@@ . there is a need for a well @-@ defined animal model in which these blood dy@@ sc@@ ra@@ sias can be studi@@ ed@@ . in four subacute toxicity studies , the intravenous administration of cef@@ on@@ ic@@ id or cef@@ az@@ ed@@ one to beagle dogs caused a dose @-@ dependent incidence of anemia , neutropenia , and thrombocytopenia after 1 @-@ 3 months of treat@@ ment@@ . a non@@ regenerative anemia was the most compromising of the cyt@@ open@@ ias and occurred in approximately 50 % of dogs receiving 400 @-@ 500 mg / kg cef@@ on@@ ic@@ id or 540 @-@ 8@@ 40 mg / kg cef@@ az@@ ed@@ on@@ e. all three cyt@@ open@@ ias were completely reversible following cessation of treatment ; the time required for recovery of the eryth@@ ron ( approximately 1 month ) was considerably longer than that of the granulocytes and platelets ( hours to a few days ) . upon re@@ challenge with either cephalosporin , the hematologic syndrome was reproduced in most dogs tested ; cef@@ on@@ ic@@ id ( but not cef@@ az@@ ed@@ one ) -treated dogs showed a substantially reduced induction period ( 15 + / - 5 days ) compared to that of the first exposure to the drug ( 61 + / - 24 days ) . this observation , along with the rapid rate of decline in red cell mass parameters of affected dogs , suggests that a hemolytic component complicated the red cell production problem and that multiple toxic@@ ologic mechanisms contributed to the cyt@@ open@@ i@@ a. we conclude that the administration of high doses of cef@@ on@@ ic@@ id or cef@@ az@@ ed@@ one to dogs can induce hemat@@ otoxicity similar to the cephalosporin @-@ induced blood dy@@ sc@@ ra@@ sias described in man and thus provides a useful model for studying the mechanisms of these disorders .
a pyridoxine @-@ dependent behavioral disorder un@@ masked by isoni@@ az@@ id@@ . a 3 @-@ year @-@ old girl had behavioral deterioration , with hyper@@ kinesis , irritability , and sleeping difficulties after the therapeutic administration of isoni@@ az@@ id@@ . the administration of pharmacologic doses of pyridoxine hydrochloride led to a disappearance of symptom@@ s. after discontinuing isoniazid therapy a similar pattern of behavior was noted that was controlled by pyrid@@ ox@@ ine@@ . a placebo had no effect , but ni@@ acin@@ amide was as effective as pyrid@@ ox@@ ine@@ . periodic withdrawal of pyridoxine was associated with return of the hyper@@ kine@@ si@@ s. the level of pyridoxal in the blood was normal during the periods of relap@@ se@@ . metabolic studies suggested a block in the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan metabol@@ is@@ m. the patient has been followed for six years and has required pharmacologic doses of pyridoxine to control her behavior .

hepatic reactions associated with ketoconazole in the un@@ ited k@@ ing@@ dom@@ . ketoconazole was introduced in the un@@ ited k@@ ingdom in 198@@ 1@@ . by nov@@ ember 1984 the committee on safety of medicines had received 82 reports of possible hepatotoxicity associated with the drug , including five de@@ ath@@ s. an analysis of the 75 cases that had been adequately followed up suggested that 16 , including three deaths , were probably related to treatment with the dru@@ g. of the remainder , 48 were possibly related to treatment , five were unlikely to be so , and six were un@@ classi@@ fi@@ ab@@ le@@ . the mean age of patients in the 16 probable cases was 5@@ 7.9 , with hepatotoxicity being more common in wom@@ en@@ . the average duration of treatment before the onset of jaundice was 61 day@@ s. none of these well validated cases occurred within the first 10 days after treat@@ ment@@ . the results of serum liver function tests suggested hepatocellular injury in 10 ( 63 % ) ; the rest showed a mixed pattern@@ . in contrast , the results of histological examination of the liver often showed evidence of cholest@@ asi@@ s. the characteristics of the 48 patients in the possible cases were simil@@ ar@@ . allergic manifestations such as rash and eosinophilia were ra@@ re@@ . hepatitis was usually reversible when treatment was stopped , with the results of liver function tests returning to normal after an average of 3.1 mon@@ th@@ s. in two of the three deaths probably associated with ketoconazole treatment the drug had been continued after the onset of jaundice and other symptoms of hepati@@ tis@@ . clinical and biochemical monitoring at regular intervals for evidence of hepatitis is advised during long term treatment with ketoconazole to prevent possible serious hepatic injury .
combined effects of prolonged prostaglandin e@@ 1 @-@ induced hypotension and haem@@ odi@@ lution on human hepatic function@@ . combined effects of prolonged prostaglandin e@@ 1 ( p@@ ge@@ 1 ) -induced hypotension and haem@@ odi@@ lution on hepatic function were studied in 30 patients undergoing hip surg@@ ery@@ . the patients were randomly allocated to one of three groups ; those in group a ( n = 10 ) were subjected to controlled hypotension alone , those in group b ( n = 10 ) to haem@@ odi@@ lution alone and those in group c ( n = 10 ) to both controlled hypotension and haem@@ odi@@ lu@@ tion@@ . haem@@ odi@@ lution in groups b and c was produced by withdrawing approximately 1000 ml of blood and replacing it with the same amount of dextran solution , and final haematocrit values were 21 or 22 % . controlled hypotension in groups a and c was induced with p@@ ge@@ 1 to maintain mean arterial blood pressure at 55 mm@@ h@@ g for 180 min@@ . measurements included arterial ketone body ratio ( ak@@ b@@ r , ace@@ to @-@ acetate / 3 @-@ hydroxybutyrate ) and clinical hepatic function parameter@@ s. ak@@ b@@ r and biological hepatic function tests showed no change throughout the time course in groups a and b@@ . in group c , ak@@ b@@ r showed a significant decrease at 120 min ( -40 % ) and at 180 min ( -@@ 49 % ) after the start of hypotension and at 60 min ( -@@ 32 % ) after recovery of normot@@ ension , and s@@ got , s@@ gp@@ t , l@@ d@@ h and total bilirubin showed significant increases after operation@@ . the results suggest that a prolonged combination of more than 120 min of p@@ ge@@ 1 @-@ induced hypotension and moderate haem@@ odi@@ lution would cause impairment of hepatic function .
levodopa @-@ induced dys@@ kine@@ sias in patients with parkin@@ son &apos;s disease : filling the bench @-@ to @-@ bedside g@@ ap@@ . levodopa is the most effective drug for the treatment of parkin@@ son &apos;s dise@@ as@@ e. however , the long @-@ term use of this dopamine precursor is complicated by highly disabling fluctuations and dys@@ kine@@ si@@ as@@ . although preclinical and clinical findings suggest pulsatile stimulation of striatal postsynaptic receptors as a key mechanism underlying levodopa @-@ induced dys@@ kine@@ sias , their pathogenesis is still un@@ cl@@ ear@@ . in recent years , evidence from animal models of parkin@@ son &apos;s disease has provided important information to understand the effect of specific receptor and post @-@ receptor molecular mechanisms underlying the development of dys@@ kinetic mo@@ v@@ ement@@ s. recent preclinical and clinical data from promising lines of research focus on the differential role of presynaptic versus postsynaptic mechanisms , dopamine receptor subtypes , ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors , and non @-@ dopaminergic neurotransmitter systems in the pathophysiology of levodopa @-@ induced dys@@ kine@@ sias .
prevention of seizures and reorganization of hippocampal functions by transplantation of bone marrow cells in the acute phase of experimental epilep@@ sy@@ . in this study , we investigated the therapeutic potential of bone marrow mononuclear cells ( b@@ m@@ cs ) in a model of epilepsy induced by pilocarpine in rat@@ s. b@@ m@@ cs obtained from green fluorescent protein ( g@@ f@@ p ) transgenic mice or rats were transplanted intravenously after induction of status epilepticus ( se ) . spontaneous recurrent seizures ( s@@ rs ) were monitored using rac@@ ine &apos;s seizure severity scal@@ e. all of the rats in the saline @-@ treated epileptic control group developed s@@ rs , whereas none of the b@@ m@@ c @-@ treated epileptic animals had seizures in the short term ( 15 days after transplantation ) , regardless of the b@@ m@@ c sour@@ c@@ e. over the long @-@ term chronic phase ( 120 days after transplantation ) , only 25 % of b@@ m@@ c @-@ treated epileptic animals had seizures , but with a lower frequency and duration compared to the epileptic control grou@@ p. the density of hippocampal neurons in the brains of animals treated with b@@ m@@ cs was markedly preser@@ ve@@ d. at hippocampal sch@@ a@@ eff@@ er collateral @-@ ca@@ 1 synapses , long @-@ term potentiation was preserved in b@@ m@@ c @-@ transplanted rats compared to epileptic contro@@ l@@ s. the donor @-@ derived g@@ f@@ p ( + ) cells were rarely found in the brains of transplanted epileptic rat@@ s. in conclusion , treatment with b@@ m@@ cs can prevent the development of chronic seizures , reduce neuronal loss , and influence the reorganization of the hippocampal neuronal network .
cardioprotective effect of sal@@ vi@@ an@@ olic acid a on isoproterenol @-@ induced myocardial infarction in rat@@ s. the present study was designed to evaluate the cardioprotective potential of sal@@ vi@@ an@@ olic acid a on isoproterenol @-@ induced myocardial infarction in rat@@ s. hemodynamic parameters and lead ii electrocardi@@ ograph were monitored and recorded continu@@ ous@@ ly@@ . cardiac marker enzymes and antioxidative parameters in serum and heart tissues were measure@@ d. assay for mitochondrial respiratory function and histopathological examination of heart tissues were perfor@@ med@@ . isoproterenol @-@ treated rats showed significant increases in the levels of lactate dehydrogenase , aspartate transaminase , creatine kinase and malondialdehyde and significant decreases in the activities of superoxide dismutase , catalase and glutathione peroxidase in serum and heart@@ . these rats also showed declines in left ventricular systolic pressure , maximum and minimum rate of developed left ventricular pressure , and elevation of left ventricular end @-@ diastolic pressure and st @-@ segment@@ . in addition , mitochondrial respiratory dysfunction characterized by decreased respiratory control ratio and ad@@ p / o was observed in isoproterenol @-@ treated rat@@ s. administration of sal@@ vi@@ an@@ olic acid a for a period of 8 days significantly attenuated isoproterenol @-@ induced cardiac dysfunction and myocardial injury and improved mitochondrial respiratory function@@ . the protective role of sal@@ vi@@ an@@ olic acid a against isoproterenol @-@ induced myocardial damage was further confirmed by histopathological examin@@ ation@@ . the results of our study suggest that sal@@ vi@@ an@@ olic acid a possessing antioxidant activity has a significant protective effect against isoproterenol @-@ induced myocardial infarction .
acute effects of n@@ - ( 2 @-@ propyl@@ pent@@ ano@@ yl ) urea on hippocampal amino acid neurotransmitters in pilocarpine @-@ induced seizure in rat@@ s. the present study aimed to investigate the anticonvulsant activity as well as the effects on the level of hippocampal amino acid neurotransmitters ( glutamate , aspartate , glycine and gab@@ a ) of n@@ - ( 2 @-@ propyl@@ pent@@ ano@@ yl ) urea ( v@@ p@@ u ) in comparison to its parent compound , valproic acid ( v@@ pa ) . v@@ p@@ u was more potent than v@@ pa , exhibiting the median effective dose ( ed ( 50 ) ) of 49 mg / kg in protecting rats against pilocarpine @-@ induced seizure whereas the corresponding value for v@@ pa was 322 mg / k@@ g. in vivo microdialysis demonstrated that an intraperitoneal administration of pilocarpine induced a pronounced increment of hippocampal glutamate and aspartate whereas no significant change was observed on the level of glycine and gab@@ a. pretreatment with either v@@ p@@ u ( 50 and 100 mg / kg ) or v@@ pa ( 300 and 600 mg / kg ) completely abolished pilocarpine @-@ evoked increases in extracellular glutamate and aspart@@ at@@ e. in addition , a statistically significant reduction was also observed on the level of gab@@ a and glycine but less than a drastic reduction of glutamate and aspartate lev@@ el@@ . based on the finding that v@@ p@@ u and v@@ pa could protect the animals against pilocarpine @-@ induced seizure it is suggested that the reduction of inhibitory amino acid neurotransmitters was comparatively minor and offset by a pronounced reduction of glutamate and aspart@@ at@@ e. therefore , like v@@ pa , the finding that v@@ p@@ u could drastically reduce pilocarpine @-@ induced increases in glutamate and aspartate should account , at least partly , for its anticonvulsant activity observed in pilocarpine @-@ induced seizure in experimental anim@@ al@@ s. some other mechanism than those being reported herein should be further investigated .
acute hepatitis attack after exposure to tel@@ ith@@ rom@@ y@@ cin@@ . introduction : antibiotic @-@ associated hepatotoxicity is ra@@ re@@ . with widespread use of antimicrobial agents , however , hepatic injury occurs frequently , and among adverse drug reactions , idi@@ osyn@@ cr@@ atic reactions are the most ser@@ i@@ ous@@ . case summary : a 25 @-@ year @-@ old male patient , with a height of 175 cm and weight of 72 kg presented to mar@@ mar@@ a university hospital emergency department , ist@@ an@@ bu@@ l , turkey , with 5 days &apos; history of jaundice , mal@@ aise , nausea , and vom@@ itin@@ g. he had been prescribed tel@@ ithromycin 400 mg / d po to treat an upper respiratory tract infection 7 days pri@@ or@@ . admission laboratory tests were as follows : alanine aminotransferase , 67 u / l ( reference range , 10 @-@ 37 u / l ) ; aspartate aminotransferase , 98 u / l ( 10 @-@ 40 u / l ) ; alkaline phosphatase , 5@@ 13 u / l ( 0 @-@ 270 u / l ) ; gamma @-@ glutam@@ yltransferase , 32 u / l ( 7 @-@ 49 u / l ) ; amylase , 46 u / l ( 0 @-@ 220 u / l ) ; total bilirubin , 20.1 mg / dl ( 0.2 @-@ 1.0 mg / dl ) ; direct bilirubin , 14.8 mg / dl ( 0 @-@ 0.3 mg / dl ) ; and albumin , 4.7 mg / dl ( 3.5 @-@ 5.4 mg / dl ) . no toxin , alcohol , or other drugs were repor@@ te@@ d. the patient had suffered a previous episode of &quot; acute hepatitis of unknown origin , &quot; that occurred after tel@@ ithromycin us@@ ag@@ e. both incidents occurred within a year@@ . discussion : tel@@ ithromycin is the first of the ket@@ olide anti@@ bacteri@@ als to receive us food and drug administration approval for clinical use@@ . it has been associated with infrequent and usually reversible severe hepatic dys@@ function@@ . based on a score of 8 on the nar@@ anj@@ o adverse drug reaction probability scale , tel@@ ithromycin was the probable cause of acute hepatitis in this patient , and pathological findings suggested drug @-@ induced toxic hepati@@ tis@@ . recurrence of hepatitis attack might have been avoided if the initial incident had been communicated to the attending physician who prescribed tel@@ ithromycin the second time@@ . conclusion : here we report a case of acute hepatitis probably associated with the administration of tel@@ ithromycin .
spironolactone @-@ induced renal insufficiency and hyperkalemia in patients with heart fail@@ ure@@ . background : a previous randomized controlled trial evaluating the use of spironolactone in heart failure patients reported a low risk of hyperkalemia ( 2 % ) and renal insufficiency ( 0 % ) . because treatments for heart failure have changed since the benefits of spironolactone were reported , the prevalence of these complications may differ in current clinical practic@@ e. we therefore sought to determine the prevalence and clinical associations of hyperkalemia and renal insufficiency in heart failure patients treated with spir@@ on@@ ol@@ act@@ on@@ e. methods : we performed a case control study of heart failure patients treated with spironolactone in our clinical practic@@ e. cases were patients who developed hyperkalemia ( k ( + ) &gt; 5.0 me@@ q / l ) or renal insufficiency ( cr &gt; or = 2.5 mg / dl ) , and they were compared to 2 randomly selected controls per cas@@ e. clinical characteristics , medications , and serum chemi@@ stries at baseline and follow @-@ up time periods were com@@ pa@@ red@@ . results : sixty @-@ seven of 9@@ 26 patients ( 7.2 % ) required discontinuation of spironolactone due to hyperkalemia ( n = 33 ) or renal failure ( n = 34 ) . patients who developed hyperkalemia were older and more likely to have diabetes , had higher baseline serum potassium levels and lower baseline potassium supplement doses , and were more likely to be treated with beta @-@ blockers than controls ( n = 134 ) . patients who developed renal insufficiency had lower baseline body weight and higher baseline serum creatinine , required higher doses of loop diuretics , and were more likely to be treated with thiazide diuretics than contro@@ l@@ s. conclusions : spironolactone @-@ induced hyperkalemia and renal insufficiency are more common in our clinical experience than reported previ@@ ous@@ ly@@ . this difference is explained by patient comorbidities and more frequent use of beta @-@ blockers .
end @-@ stage renal disease ( es@@ rd ) after orthotopic liver transplantation ( ol@@ t@@ x ) using calcineurin @-@ based immunotherapy : risk of development and treat@@ ment@@ . background : the calcineurin inhibitors cyclosporine and tacrolimus are both known to be nephro@@ toxic@@ . their use in orthotopic liver transplantation ( ol@@ t@@ x ) has dramatically improved success rat@@ es@@ . recently , however , we have had an increase of patients who are presenting after ol@@ t@@ x with end @-@ stage renal disease ( es@@ rd ) . this retrospective study examines the incidence and treatment of es@@ rd and chronic renal failure ( cr@@ f ) in ol@@ t@@ x patient@@ s. methods : patients receiving an ol@@ t@@ x only from j@@ une 1985 through dec@@ ember of 1994 who survived 6 months postoperatively were studied ( n = 8@@ 34 ) . our prospectively collected database was the source of inform@@ ation@@ . patients were divided into three groups : controls , no cr@@ f or es@@ rd , n = 7@@ 48 ; cr@@ f , sustained serum creatinine &gt; 2.5 mg / dl , n = 41 ; and es@@ rd , n = 45@@ . groups were compared for preoperative laboratory variables , diagnosis , postoperative variables , survival , type of es@@ rd therapy , and survival from onset of es@@ r@@ d. results : at 13 years after ol@@ t@@ x , the incidence of severe renal dysfunction was 18.1 % ( cr@@ f 8.6 % and es@@ rd 9.5 % ) . compared with control patients , cr@@ f and es@@ rd patients had higher preoperative serum creatinine levels , a greater percentage of patients with hepat@@ o@@ renal syndrome , higher percentage requirement for dialysis in the first 3 months postoperatively , and a higher 1 @-@ year serum creatin@@ ine@@ . multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis using preoperative and postoperative variables identified that an increase of serum creatinine compared with average at 1 year , 3 months , and 4 weeks postoperatively were independent risk factors for the development of cr@@ f or es@@ rd with odds ratios of 2.6 , 2.2 , and 1.6 , respec@@ ti@@ vel@@ y@@ . overall survival from the time of ol@@ t@@ x was not significantly different among groups , but by year 13 , the survival of the patients who had es@@ rd was only 28.2 % compared with 5@@ 4.6 % in the control grou@@ p. patients developing es@@ rd had a 6 @-@ year survival after onset of es@@ rd of 27 % for the patients receiving hemodialysis versus 71.4 % for the patients developing es@@ rd who subsequently received kidney transpl@@ ant@@ s. conclusions : patients who are more than 10 years post @-@ ol@@ t@@ x have cr@@ f and es@@ rd at a high rat@@ e. the development of es@@ rd decreases survival , particularly in those patients treated with dialysis on@@ ly@@ . patients who develop es@@ rd have a higher preoperative and 1 @-@ year serum creatinine and are more likely to have hepat@@ o@@ renal syn@@ dro@@ me@@ . however , an increase of serum creatinine at various times postoperatively is more predictive of the development of cr@@ f or es@@ r@@ d. new strategies for long @-@ term immunosuppression may be needed to decrease this complication .
effect of intravenous nimodipine on blood pressure and outcome after acute stro@@ ke@@ . background and purpose : the intravenous nimodipine west euro@@ pe@@ an stroke trial ( in@@ west ) found a correlation between nimodipine @-@ induced reduction in blood pressure ( bp ) and an unfavorable outcome in acute stro@@ ke@@ . we sought to confirm this correlation with and without adjustment for prognostic variables and to investigate outcome in subgroups with increasing levels of bp reduc@@ tion@@ . methods : patients with a clinical diagnosis of ischemic stroke ( within 24 hours ) were consecutively allocated to receive placebo ( n = 100 ) , 1 mg / h ( low @-@ dose ) nimodipine ( n = 101 ) , or 2 mg / h ( high @-@ dose ) nimodipine ( n = 94 ) . the correlation between average bp change during the first 2 days and the outcome at day 21 was analy@@ z@@ ed@@ . results : two hundred sixty @-@ five patients were included in this analysis ( n = 92 , 93 , and 80 for placebo , low dose , and high dose , respectively ) . nimodipine treatment resulted in a statistically significant reduction in systolic bp ( s@@ bp ) and diastolic bp ( d@@ bp ) from baseline compared with placebo during the first few day@@ s. in multivariate analysis , a significant correlation between d@@ bp reduction and worsening of the neurological score was found for the high @-@ dose group ( beta = 0.49 , p = 0 . 0@@ 48 ) . patients with a d@@ bp reduction of &gt; or = 20 % in the high @-@ dose group had a significantly increased adjusted or for the compound outcome variable death or dependency ( bar@@ thel index &lt; 60 ) ( n / n = 25 / 26 , or 10 . 16 , 95 % ci 1.02 to 10@@ 1.74 ) and death alone ( n / n = 9 / 26 , or 4.@@ 336 , 95 % ci 1.@@ 131 16.@@ 619 ) compared with all placebo patients ( n / n = 62 / 92 and 14 / 92 , respectively ) . there was no correlation between s@@ bp change and outcom@@ e. conclusions : d@@ bp , but not s@@ bp , reduction was associated with neurological worsening after the intravenous administration of high @-@ dose nimodipine after acute stro@@ ke@@ . for low @-@ dose nimodipine , the results were not con@@ clu@@ si@@ ve@@ . these results do not confirm or exclude a neuroprotective property of nimodipine .
transient neurologic symptoms after spinal anesthesia : a lower incidence with pr@@ il@@ ocaine and bupivacaine than with lid@@ oc@@ ain@@ e. background : recent evidence suggests that transient neurologic symptoms ( t@@ n@@ ss ) frequently follow lidocaine spinal anesthesia but are infrequent with bup@@ ivac@@ ain@@ e. however , identification of a short @-@ acting local anesthetic to substitute for lidocaine for brief surgical procedures remains an important go@@ al@@ . pr@@ il@@ ocaine is an amide local anesthetic with a duration of action similar to that of lid@@ oc@@ ain@@ e. accordingly , the present , prospective double @-@ blind study compares pr@@ il@@ ocaine with lidocaine and bupivacaine with respect to duration of action and relative risk of t@@ n@@ ss@@ . methods : ninety patients classified as amer@@ ican society of anesthesiologists physical status i or ii who were scheduled for short gynecologic procedures under spinal anesthesia were randomly allocated to receive 2.5 ml 2 % lidocaine in 7.5 % glucose , 2 % pr@@ il@@ ocaine in 7.5 % glucose , or 0.5 % bupivacaine in 7.5 % glucos@@ e. all solutions were provided in blinded vials by the hospital pharmac@@ y@@ . details of spinal puncture , extension and regression of spinal block , and the times to reach discharge criteria were not@@ ed@@ . in the evening of postoperative day 1 , patients were evaluated for t@@ n@@ ss by a physician unaware of the drug administered and the details of the anesthetic proced@@ ure@@ . results : nine of 30 patients receiving lidocaine experienced t@@ n@@ ss , 1 of 30 patients receiving pr@@ il@@ ocaine ( p = 0.03 ) had them , and none of 30 patients receiving bupivacaine had t@@ n@@ ss@@ . times to ambul@@ ate and to void were similar after lidocaine and pr@@ il@@ ocaine ( 150 vs. 165 min and 238 vs. 253 min , respectively ) but prolonged after bupivacaine ( 200 and 299 min , respectively ; p &lt; 0.05 ) . conclusions : pr@@ il@@ ocaine may be preferable to lidocaine for short surgical procedures because it has a similar duration of action but a lower incidence of t@@ n@@ ss .
the role of nicotine in smoking @-@ related cardiovascular dise@@ as@@ e. nicotine activates the sympathetic nervous system and in this way could contribute to cardiovascular dise@@ as@@ e. animal studies and mechanistic studies indicate that nicotine could play a role in accelerating atherosclerosis , but evidence among humans is too inadequate to be definitive about such an effec@@ t. almost certainly , nicotine via its hemodynamic effects contributes to acute cardiovascular events , although current evidence suggests that the effects of nicotine are much less important than are the pro@@ thrombotic effects of cigarette smoking or the effects of carbon mon@@ ox@@ ide@@ . nicotine does not appear to enhance thrombosis among human@@ s. clinical studies of pipe smokers and people using transdermal nicotine support the idea that toxins other than nicotine are the most important causes of acute cardiovascular event@@ s. finally , the dose response for cardiovascular events of nicotine appears to be flat , suggesting that if nicotine is involved , adverse effects might be seen with relatively low @-@ level cigarette exposures .

composition of gall bladder stones associated with octreotide : response to oral urso@@ deoxycholic acid@@ . octreotide , an effective treatment for acromegaly , induces gall bladder stones in 13 @-@ 60 % of patient@@ s. because knowledge of stone composition is essential for studies of their pathogenesis , treatment , and prevention , this was investigated by direct and indirect methods in 14 octreotide treated acromegal@@ ic patients with gall st@@ on@@ es@@ . chemical analysis of gall stones retrieved at cholecystectomy from two patients , showed that they contained 71 % and 87 % cholesterol by weigh@@ t. in the remaining 12 patients , localised computed tomography of the gall bladder showed that eight had stones with maximum attenuation scores of &lt; 100 h@@ oun@@ s@@ field units ( values of &lt; 100 hu predict cholesterol rich , dis@@ sol@@ vable stones ) . gall bladder bile was obtained by ultrasound guided , fine needle puncture from six patient@@ s. all six patients had supers@@ atur@@ ated bile ( mean ( se@@ m ) cholesterol saturation index of 1.19 ( 0.08 ) ( range 1.01 @-@ 1.53 ) ) and all had abnormally rapid cholesterol micro@@ crystal nucleation times ( &lt; 4 days ( range 1 @-@ 4 ) ) , whilst in four , the bile contained cholesterol micro@@ crystals immediately after sam@@ pl@@ ing@@ . of the 12 patients considered for oral urso@@ deoxycholic acid ( ud@@ ca ) treatment , two had a blocked cystic duct and were not started on ud@@ ca while one was lost to follow up@@ . after one year of treatment , five of the remaining nine patients showed either partial ( n = 3 ) or complete ( n = 2 ) gall stone dissolution , suggesting that their stones were cholesterol rich@@ . this corresponds , by actuarial ( life table ) analysis , to a combined gall stone dissolution rate of 58.3 ( 15.9 % ) . in conclusion , octreotide induced gall stones are generally small , multiple , and cholesterol rich although , in common with spontaneous gall stone disease , at presentation some patients will have a blocked cystic duct and some gall stones containing calcium .
cardiovascular complications associated with terbutaline treatment for preterm labor@@ . severe cardiovascular complications occurred in eight of 160 patients treated with terbutaline for preterm labor@@ . associated corticosteroid therapy and twin gest@@ ations appear to be predisposing factor@@ s. potential mechanisms of the pathophysiology are briefly discussed .
neurologic effects of subarachnoid administration of 2 @-@ chloro@@ procaine @-@ ce , bupivacaine , and low ph normal saline in dog@@ s. the purpose of this study was to evaluate the neurologic consequences of deliberate subarachnoid injection of large volumes of 2 @-@ chloro@@ procaine @-@ ce in experimental anim@@ al@@ s. the possible role of low ph as well as total volume as potential factors in causing neurotoxicity was evalu@@ ated@@ . the 65 dogs in the study received injections in the subarachnoid space as follows : 6 to 8 ml of bupivacaine ( n = 15 ) , 2 @-@ chloro@@ procaine @-@ ce ( n = 20 ) , low ph normal saline ( ph 3.0 ) ( n = 20 ) , or normal saline ( n = 10 ) . of the 20 animals that received subarachnoid injection of 2 @-@ chloro@@ procaine @-@ ce seven ( 35 % ) developed hind @-@ limb par@@ aly@@ si@@ s. none of the animals that received bupivacaine , normal saline , or normal saline titrated to a ph 3.0 developed hind @-@ limb par@@ aly@@ si@@ s. of the 15 spinal cords of the animals that received 2 @-@ chloro@@ procaine @-@ ce , 13 showed sub@@ pial necrosis ; the nerve roots and subarachnoid vessels were normal@@ . the spinal cords of the animals that received bupivacaine , low ph normal saline ( ph 3.0 ) , or normal saline did not show abnormal findings .
early adjuvant adriamycin in superficial bladder carcin@@ om@@ a. a multicenter study was performed in 110 patients with superficial transitional cell carcinoma of the bl@@ ad@@ der@@ . adriamycin ( 50 mg / 50 ml ) was administered intra@@ vesi@@ cally within 24 h after transurethral resection of ta @-@ t1 ( o @-@ a ) bladder tumor@@ s. instillation was repeated twice during the first week , then weekly during the first month and afterwards monthly for 1 year@@ . the tolerance was evaluated in these 110 patients , and 29 patients presented with local side @-@ effec@@ ts@@ . in 24 of these patients chemical cystitis was severe enough for them to drop out of the stud@@ y@@ . no systemic side @-@ effects were obser@@ ve@@ d. recurrence was studied in 82 evaluable patients after 1 year of follow @-@ up and in 72 patients followed for 2 @-@ 3 years ( mean 32 months ) . of the 82 patients studied after 1 year , 23 had primary and 59 recurrent dise@@ as@@ e. of the 82 evaluable patients , 50 did not show any recurrence after 1 year ( 61 % ) , while 32 presented with one or more recurrences ( 39 % ) . of these recurrences , 27 were t1 tumors while five progressed to more highly invasive le@@ sion@@ s. in patients that were free of recurrence during the first year , 80 % remained tumor @-@ free during the 2- to 3 @-@ year follow @-@ up period@@ . of the patients developing one or more recurrences during the first year , only 50 % presented with further recurrence once the instill@@ ations were stop@@ ped@@ . the beneficial effect of adriamycin appears obvious and might be related to the drug itself , the early and repeated instill@@ ations after tu@@ r , or both .
hyperkalemia associated with sul@@ ind@@ ac therap@@ y@@ . hyperkalemia has recently been recognized as a complication of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents ( n@@ said ) such as in@@ dometh@@ acin@@ . several recent studies have stressed the renal sparing features of sul@@ ind@@ ac , owing to its lack of interference with renal prostacyclin synthesi@@ s. we describe 4 patients in whom hyperkalemia ranging from 6.1 to 6.9 me@@ q / l developed within 3 to 8 days of sul@@ ind@@ ac administr@@ ation@@ . in all of them normal serum potassium levels reached within 2 to 4 days of stopping sul@@ ind@@ ac@@ . as no other medications known to effect serum potassium had been given concomitantly , this course of events is suggestive of a cause @-@ and @-@ effect relationship between sul@@ ind@@ ac and hyper@@ kal@@ em@@ i@@ a. these observations indicate that initial h@@ opes that sul@@ ind@@ ac may not be associated with the adverse renal effects of other n@@ said are probably not justified .
ventricular tachyarrhythmias during cesarean section after rit@@ od@@ rine therapy : interaction with anesthe@@ tic@@ s. this case illustrates that patients receiving rit@@ od@@ rine for preterm labor may risk interactions between the residual bet@@ am@@ imetic effects of rit@@ od@@ rine and the effects of anesthetics during cesarean sec@@ tion@@ . such interactions may result in serious cardiovascular complications even after cessation of an infusion of rit@@ od@@ r@@ ine@@ . preoperative assessment should focus on cardiovascular status and serum potassium lev@@ el@@ . delaying induction of anesthesia should be considered whenever possi@@ ble@@ . careful fluid administration and cautious use of titrated doses of ephedrine are advis@@ ed@@ . after delivery of the infant , there should be no contraindication to the use of an alpha @-@ adrenergic vasop@@ ressor such as phenylephrine to treat hypotensive patients with tachycardia .
immunohistochemical , electron microscopic and morphometric studies of estrogen @-@ induced rat prolactin@@ omas after bromocriptine treat@@ ment@@ . to clarify the effects of bromocriptine on prolactin@@ oma cells in vivo , immunohistochemical , ultrastructural and morph@@ ometrical analyses were applied to estrogen @-@ induced rat prolactin@@ oma cells 1 h and 6 h after injection of bromocriptine ( 3 mg / kg of body weight ) . one h after treatment , serum prolactin levels decreased mark@@ ed@@ ly@@ . electron microscopy disclosed many secretory granules , slightly distorted rough endoplasmic reticulum , and partially dilated gol@@ gi cisternae in the prolactin@@ oma cell@@ s. morphometric analysis revealed that the volume density of secretory granules increased , while the volume density of cytoplasmic microtubules decre@@ as@@ ed@@ . these findings suggest that lowered serum prolactin levels in the early phase of bromocriptine treatment may result from an impaired secretion of prolactin due to decreasing numbers of cytoplasmic microtub@@ ul@@ es@@ . at 6 h after injection , serum prolactin levels were still considerably lower than in contro@@ l@@ s. the prolactin@@ oma cells at this time were well gran@@ ulated , with vesi@@ cul@@ ated rough endoplasmic reticulum and markedly dilated gol@@ gi cister@@ na@@ e. electron microscopical immunohistochemistry revealed positive reaction products noted on the secretory granules , gol@@ gi cisternae , and endoplasmic reticulum of the untreated rat prolactin@@ oma cell@@ s. however , only secretory granules showed the positive reaction products for prolactin 6 h after bromocriptine treatment of the adenoma cell@@ s. an increase in the volume density of secretory granules and a decrease in the volume densities of rough endoplasmic reticulum and microtubules was determined by morphometric analysis , suggesting that bromocriptine inhibits protein synthesis as well as bringing about a disturbance of the prolactin secretion .
on two paradoxical side @-@ effects of prednisolone in rats , ribosomal r@@ na bi@@ osyn@@ theses , and a mechanism of action@@ . liver enlargement and muscle wast@@ age occurred in w@@ istar rats following the subcutaneous administration of predn@@ isol@@ on@@ e. in the liver both the content of r@@ na and the biosynthesis of ribosomal r@@ na increased while both the r@@ na content and ribosomal r@@ na biosynthesis were reduced in the gastrocnemius mus@@ cle@@ . it is suggested that the drug acted in a selective and tissue @-@ specific manner to enhance ribosomal r@@ na synthesis in the liver and de@@ press such synthesis in the mus@@ cle@@ . this view supports the contention that the liver and muscle are independent sites of prednisolone action .
possible intramuscular midazolam @-@ associated cardiorespiratory arrest and de@@ ath@@ . midazolam hydrochloride is commonly used for dental or endoscopic proced@@ u@@ res@@ . although generally consisted safe when given intramuscularly , intravenous administration is known to cause respiratory and cardiovascular de@@ pres@@ sion@@ . this report describes the first published case of cardiorespiratory arrest and death associated with intramuscular administration of mid@@ azol@@ am@@ . information regarding midazolam use is reviewed to provide recommendation for safe administration .
serial epilepsy caused by levodopa / carb@@ id@@ opa administration in two patients on hemodi@@ aly@@ si@@ s. two patients with similar clinical features are presented : both patients had chronic renal failure , on hemodialysis for many years but recently begun on a high @-@ flux dialy@@ zer ; both had been receiving a carb@@ id@@ opa / levodopa preparation ; and both had the onset of halluc@@ in@@ osis and recurrent seizures , which were refractory to anticonvuls@@ ant@@ s. the first patient died without a diagnosis ; the second patient had a dramatic recovery following the administration of vitamin b@@ 6@@ . neither patient was considered to have a renal state sufficiently severe enough to explain their presentation .
effect of l @-@ alpha @-@ glycer@@ yl @-@ phosphoryl@@ choline on amnesia caused by scop@@ ol@@ amin@@ e. the present study was carried out to test the effects of l @-@ alpha @-@ glycer@@ yl@@ phosphoryl@@ choline ( l @-@ alpha @-@ g@@ f@@ c ) on memory impairment induced by scopolamine in man@@ . thirty @-@ two healthy young volunteers were randomly allocated to four different grou@@ ps@@ . they were given a ten day pretreatment with either l @-@ alpha @-@ g@@ f@@ c or placebo , p.o. , and on the elev@@ enth day either scopolamine or placebo , i.m. before and 0.5 , 1 , 2 , 3 , and 6 h after injection the subjects were given attention and m@@ nem@@ onic test@@ s. the findings of this study indicate that the drug is able to antagonize impairment of attention and memory induced by scopolamine .
seizures induced by the cocaine metabolite benzoyl@@ ec@@ gon@@ ine in rat@@ s. the half @-@ life ( t1 / 2 ) of cocaine is relatively short , but some of the consequences of its use , such as seizures and strokes , can occur hours after expos@@ ure@@ . this led us to hypothesize that a metabolite of cocaine may be responsible for some of those delayed sequel@@ a@@ e. we evaluated the potential of the major metabolite of cocaine , benzoyl@@ ec@@ gon@@ ine ( be ) , to cause seiz@@ u@@ res@@ . two separate equimolar doses ( 0.2 and 0.4 mumol ) of either cocaine or be were injected ventricul@@ arly in un@@ anesthetized juvenile rat@@ s. treated rats were then evaluated for incidence , latency , and seizure pattern or for locomotor activity in animals without seiz@@ u@@ res@@ . be @-@ induced seizures occurred more frequently and had significantly longer latencies than those induced by equimolar amounts of coc@@ ain@@ e. whereas cocaine @-@ induced seizures were best characterized as brief , generalized , and tonic and resulted in death , those induced by be were prolonged , often multiple and mixed in type , and rarely resulted in de@@ ath@@ . electrical recordings from the hippocampus showed a rhythmic progression in e@@ eg frequency and voltage with clinical seizure expres@@ sion@@ . be @-@ injected rats that did not have seizures had significantly more locomotor activity than cocaine @-@ injected animals without seiz@@ u@@ res@@ . the finding that coc@@ ain@@ e- and be @-@ induced seizures differ in several respects suggests more than one mechanism for cocaine @-@ induced seizures and emphasizes the importance of a cocaine metabolite , be .

prenatal protein deprivation alters dopamine @-@ mediated behaviors and dopaminergic and glutamatergic receptor bin@@ d@@ ing@@ . epidemiological evidence indicates that prenatal nutritional deprivation may increase the risk of schizophren@@ i@@ a. the goal of these studies was to use an animal model to examine the effects of prenatal protein deprivation on behaviors and receptor binding with relevance to schizophren@@ i@@ a. we report that prenatally protein deprived ( p@@ d ) female rats showed an increased stere@@ otypic response to apomorphine and an increased locomotor response to amphetamine in adul@@ tho@@ od@@ . these differences were not observed during puber@@ ty@@ . no changes in haloperidol @-@ induced catal@@ epsy or m@@ k @-@ 801 @-@ induced locomotion were seen following p@@ d. in addition , p@@ d female rats showed increased ( 3 ) h @-@ m@@ k @-@ 801 binding in the striatum and hippocampus , but not in the cor@@ tex@@ . p@@ d female rats also showed increased ( 3 ) h @-@ haloperidol binding and decreased dopamine transporter binding in stri@@ at@@ um@@ . no statistically significant changes in behavior or receptor binding were found in p@@ d males with the exception of increased ( 3 ) h @-@ m@@ k @-@ 801 binding in cor@@ tex@@ . this animal model may be useful to explore the mechanisms by which prenatal nutritional deficiency enhances risk for schizophrenia in humans and may also have implications for developmental processes leading to differential sensitivity to drugs of abuse .
m@@ tor inhibitors @-@ induced proteinuria : mechanisms , significance , and manag@@ ement@@ . massive urinary protein excretion has been observed after conversion from calcineurin inhibitors to mammalian target of rapamycin ( m@@ tor ) inhibitors , especially sirolimus , in renal transplant recipients with chronic allograft nephro@@ path@@ y@@ . because proteinuria is a major predictive factor of poor transplantation outcome , many studies focused on this adverse event during the past year@@ s. whether proteinuria was due to sirolimus or only a consequence of calcineurin inhibitors withdrawal remained un@@ solved until high range proteinuria has been observed during sirolimus therapy in islet transplantation and in patients who received sirolimus de nov@@ o. podocyte injury and focal segmental glomerulosclerosis have been related to m@@ tor inhibition in some patients , but the pathways underlying these lesions remain hypo@@ the@@ tic@@ . we discuss herein the possible mechanisms and the significance of m@@ tor blockade @-@ induced proteinuria .
hypothalamic prolactin receptor messenger ribonucleic acid levels , prolactin signaling , and hyperprolactin@@ emic inhibition of pulsatile luteinizing hormone secretion are dependent on estr@@ adi@@ ol@@ . hyperprolactinemia can reduce fertility and lib@@ id@@ o. although central prolactin actions are thought to contribute to this , the mechanisms are poorly underst@@ o@@ od@@ . we first tested whether chronic hyperprolactinemia inhibited two neuroendocrine parameters necessary for female fertility : pulsatile l@@ h secretion and the estrogen @-@ induced l@@ h surg@@ e. chronic hyperprolactinemia induced by the dopamine antagonist sulpiride caused a 40 % reduction l@@ h pulse frequency in ovariectomized rats , but only in the presence of chronic low levels of estr@@ adi@@ ol@@ . sulpiride did not affect the magnitude of a steroid @-@ induced l@@ h surge or the percentage of gn@@ r@@ h neurons activated during the surg@@ e. estradiol is known to influence expression of the long form of prolactin receptors ( pr@@ l @-@ r ) and components of prolactin &apos;s signaling path@@ w@@ ay@@ . to test the hypothesis that estrogen increases pr@@ l @-@ r expression and sensitivity to prolactin , we next demonstrated that estradiol greatly augments prolactin @-@ induced stat@@ 5 activ@@ ation@@ . l@@ astly , we measured pr@@ l @-@ r and suppressor of cytokine signaling ( s@@ oc@@ s @-@ 1 and -3 and cis , which reflect the level of prolactin signaling ) m@@ r@@ n@@ as in response to sulpiride and estr@@ adi@@ ol@@ . sulpiride induced only s@@ oc@@ s @-@ 1 in the medial preoptic area , where gn@@ r@@ h neurons are regulated , but in the arcuate nucleus and choroid plexus , pr@@ l @-@ r , s@@ oc@@ s @-@ 3 , and cis m@@ r@@ na levels were also induc@@ ed@@ . estradiol enhanced these effects on s@@ oc@@ s @-@ 3 and cis@@ . interestingly , estradiol also induced pr@@ l @-@ r , s@@ oc@@ s @-@ 3 , and cis m@@ r@@ na levels in@@ depend@@ ent@@ ly@@ . these data show that gn@@ r@@ h pulse frequency is inhibited by chronic hyperprolactinemia in a steroid @-@ dependent man@@ ner@@ . they also provide evidence for estradiol @-@ dependent and brain region @-@ specific regulation of pr@@ l @-@ r expression and signaling responses by prolactin .
estrogen prevents cholesteryl ester accumulation in macrophages induced by the hi@@ v protease inhibitor r@@ iton@@ avir@@ . individuals with hi@@ v can now live long lives with drug therapy that often includes protease inhibitors such as r@@ iton@@ avir@@ . many patients , however , develop negative long @-@ term side effects such as premature atheros@@ cler@@ osi@@ s. we have previously demonstrated that ritonavir treatment increases atherosclerotic lesion formation in male mice to a greater extent than in female mic@@ e. furthermore , peripheral blood monocytes isolated from ritonavir @-@ treated females had less cholesteryl ester accum@@ ul@@ ation@@ . in the present study , we have investigated the molecular mechanisms by which female hormones influence cholesterol metabolism in macrophages in response to the hi@@ v protease inhibitor r@@ iton@@ avir@@ . we have utilized the human monocyte cell line , th@@ p @-@ 1 as a model to address this question@@ . briefly , cells were differentiated for 72 h with 100 nm p@@ ma to obtain a macrophage @-@ like phenotype in the presence or absence of 1 nm 17beta @-@ estradiol ( e@@ 2 ) , 100 nm progesterone or vehicle ( 0.01 % ethanol ) . cells were then treated with 30 ng / ml ritonavir or vehicle in the presence of aggregated l@@ dl for 24 h@@ . cell extracts were harvested , and lipid or total r@@ na was isol@@ ated@@ . e@@ 2 decreased the accumulation of cholesteryl esters in macrophages following ritonavir treat@@ ment@@ . ritonavir increased the expression of the scavenger receptor , cd@@ 36 m@@ r@@ na , responsible for the uptake of l@@ dl@@ . additionally , ritonavir treatment selectively increased the relative levels of p@@ par@@ gamma m@@ r@@ na , a transcription factor responsible for the regulation of cd@@ 36 m@@ r@@ na expres@@ sion@@ . treatment with e@@ 2 , however , failed to prevent these increases at the m@@ r@@ na lev@@ el@@ . e@@ 2 did , however , significantly suppress cd@@ 36 protein levels as measured by fluorescent immunocyto@@ chemi@@ str@@ y@@ . this data suggests that e@@ 2 modifies the expression of cd@@ 36 at the level of protein expression in monocyte @-@ derived macrophages resulting in reduced cholesteryl ester accumulation following ritonavir treatment .
upregulation of brain expression of p @-@ glycoprotein in m@@ r@@ p2 @-@ deficient t@@ r ( - ) rats resembles seizure @-@ induced up @-@ regulation of this drug efflux transporter in normal rat@@ s. purpose : the multidrug resistance protein 2 ( m@@ r@@ p2 ) is a drug efflux transporter that is expressed predominantly at the apical domain of hepatocytes but seems also to be expressed at the apical membrane of brain capillary endothelial cells that form the blood @-@ brain barrier ( b@@ b@@ b ) . m@@ r@@ p2 is absent in the transport @-@ deficient ( t@@ r ( - ) ) w@@ istar rat mutant , so that this rat strain was very helpful in defining substrates of m@@ r@@ p2 by comparing tissue concentrations or functional activities of compounds in m@@ r@@ p2 @-@ deficient rats with those in transport @-@ competent w@@ istar rat@@ s. by using this strategy to study the involvement of m@@ r@@ p2 in brain access of antiepileptic drugs ( a@@ eds ) , we recently reported that phenytoin is a substrate for m@@ r@@ p2 in the b@@ b@@ b@@ . however , one drawback of such studies in genetically deficient rats is the fact that compensatory changes with upregulation of other transporters can occur@@ . this prompted us to study the brain expression of p @-@ glycoprotein ( p@@ gp ) , a major drug efflux transporter in many tissues , including the b@@ b@@ b , in t@@ r ( - ) rats compared with non@@ mutant ( wild @-@ type ) w@@ istar rat@@ s. methods : the expression of m@@ r@@ p2 and p@@ gp in brain and liver sections of t@@ r ( - ) rats and normal w@@ istar rats was determined with immunohistochemistry , by using a novel , highly selective monoclonal m@@ r@@ p2 antibody and the monoclonal p@@ gp antibody c@@ 219 , respec@@ ti@@ vel@@ y@@ . results : immunofluorescence staining with the m@@ r@@ p2 antibody was found to label a high number of microvessels throughout the brain in normal w@@ istar rats , whereas such labeling was absent in t@@ r ( - ) rat@@ s. t@@ r ( - ) rats exhibited a significant up @-@ regulation of p@@ gp in brain capillary endothelial cells compared with wild @-@ type contro@@ l@@ s. no such obvious upregulation of p@@ gp was observed in liver sec@@ tion@@ s. a comparable overexpression of p@@ gp in the b@@ b@@ b was obtained after pilocarpine @-@ induced seizures in wild @-@ type w@@ istar rat@@ s. experiments with systemic administration of the p@@ gp substrate phenobarbital and the selective p@@ gp inhibitor t@@ ari@@ qu@@ id@@ ar in t@@ r ( - ) rats substantiated that p@@ gp is functional and compens@@ ates for the lack of m@@ r@@ p2 in the b@@ b@@ b@@ . conclusions : the data on t@@ r ( - ) rats indicate that p@@ gp plays an important role in the compensation of m@@ r@@ p2 deficiency in the b@@ b@@ b@@ . because such a compensatory mechanism most likely occurs to reduce injury to the brain from cytotoxic compounds , the present data substantiate the concept that m@@ r@@ p2 performs a protective role in the b@@ b@@ b@@ . furthermore , our data suggest that t@@ r ( - ) rats are an interesting tool to study consequences of overexpression of p@@ gp in the b@@ b@@ b on access of drugs in the brain , without the need of inducing seizures or other p@@ gp @-@ enhancing events for this purpose .
use of chromosome substitution strains to identify seizure susceptibility loci in mic@@ e. seizure susceptibility varies among inbred mouse str@@ ain@@ s. chromosome substitution strains ( c@@ ss ) , in which a single chromosome from one inbred strain ( donor ) has been transferred onto a second strain ( host ) by repeated back@@ crossing , may be used to identify quantitative trait loci ( q@@ t@@ ls ) that contribute to seizure suscepti@@ bil@@ it@@ y@@ . q@@ t@@ ls for susceptibility to pilocarpine @-@ induced seizures , a model of temporal lobe epilepsy , have not been reported , and c@@ ss have not previously been used to localize seizure susceptibility gen@@ es@@ . we report q@@ t@@ ls identified using a b@@ 6 ( host ) x a / j ( donor ) c@@ ss panel to localize genes involved in susceptibility to pilocarpine @-@ induced seiz@@ u@@ res@@ . three hundred fifty @-@ five adult male c@@ ss mice , 58 b@@ 6 , and 39 a / j were tested for susceptibility to pilocarpine @-@ induced seiz@@ u@@ res@@ . highest stage reached and latency to each stage were recorded for all mic@@ e. b@@ 6 mice were resistant to seizures and slower to reach stages compared to a / j mic@@ e. the c@@ ss for chromosomes 10 and 18 progressed to the most severe stages , diver@@ ging dramatically from the b@@ 6 phen@@ otyp@@ e. latencies to stages were also significantly shorter for c@@ ss@@ 10 and c@@ ss@@ 18 mic@@ e. c@@ ss mapping suggests seizure susceptibility loci on mouse chromosomes 10 and 18@@ . this approach provides a framework for identifying potentially novel homologous candidate genes for human temporal lobe epilepsy .
investigation of mitochondrial involvement in the experimental model of epilepsy induced by pil@@ ocar@@ pine@@ . mitochondrial abnormalities have been associated with several aspects of epilept@@ ogenesis , such as energy generation , control of cell death , neurotransmitter synthesis , and free radical ( fr ) produc@@ tion@@ . increased production of fr@@ s may cause mt@@ d@@ na damage leading to decreased activities of oxidative phosphorylation complexes containing mt@@ d@@ na @-@ encoded sub@@ un@@ it@@ s. in this study , we investigated whether increased generation of fr during status epilepticus would be sufficient to provoke abnormalities in mt@@ d@@ na and in the expression and activity of cytochrome c oxidase ( c@@ co ) , complex iv of the respiratory chain , in the chronic phase of the pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilep@@ sy@@ . d@@ na analysis revealed low amounts of a 4.8 kb mt@@ d@@ na deletion but with no differences in frequency or quantity in the control and experimental grou@@ ps@@ . we did not find abnormalities in the expression and distribution of an mt@@ d@@ na @-@ encoded subunit of c@@ co ( c@@ co @-@ i ) or a relative decrease in c@@ co @-@ i when compared with nuclear @-@ encoded subunits ( c@@ co @-@ iv and s@@ d@@ h @-@ f@@ p ) . no abnormality in c@@ co activity was observed through histo@@ chemi@@ str@@ y@@ . although evidences of mitochondrial abnormalities were found in previously published studies , our results do not suggest that the fr@@ s , generated during the acute phase , determined important abnormalities in mt@@ d@@ na , in expression of c@@ co @-@ i , and in c@@ co activity .
causes of acute thrombotic microangiopathy in patients receiving kidney transpl@@ ant@@ ation@@ . objectives : thrombotic microangiopathy is a well @-@ known problem in patients following renal transpl@@ ant@@ ation@@ . in post@@ renal transplantation , thrombotic microangiopathy is often a reflection of hemolytic uremic syn@@ dro@@ me@@ . we aimed to determine the causes of thrombotic microangiopathy in a population of renal transplantation recipients and discuss the liter@@ at@@ ure@@ . materials and methods : we investigated the causes of thrombotic microangiopathy during a 1 @-@ year period , from j@@ une 2003 to j@@ une 2004 , at the king fa@@ had national guard hospital in ri@@ y@@ ad@@ h , s@@ audi arab@@ ia , by reviewing the slides of all transplant biopsies ( n = 25 ) performed during this inter@@ val@@ . pre- and posttransplant cross@@ matching was done when possi@@ ble@@ . results : five cases of thrombotic microangiopathy were found@@ . three of these cases were from the 25 transplantations performed at king fa@@ had national guard hospital , while the other 2 transplantations had been performed abroad and were referred to us for follow @-@ up@@ . three cases were related to cyclosporine , and 1 case was secondary to both cyclosporine and tac@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ . the fifth case had features of thrombotic microangiopathy related to an antiphospholipid syndrome in a patient with systemic lupus erythemat@@ os@@ us@@ . conclusions : in the literature , the most @-@ frequent cause of hemolytic uremic syndrome in patients following renal transplantation is recurrence of the hemolytic uremic syn@@ dro@@ me@@ . other causes include drug @-@ related ( cyclosporine , tacrolimus ) toxicity , procoagulant status , and antibody @-@ mediated rejec@@ tion@@ . we found that the most @-@ frequent cause of thrombotic microangiopathy was drug related , secondary mainly to cyclospor@@ ine@@ . in the current study , the frequency of thrombotic microangiopathy was similar to the percentage reported in the literature ( 20 % ) .
severe reversible left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction due to accidental iatrogenic epinephrine over@@ dos@@ e. catecholamine @-@ induced cardiomyopathy due to chronic excess of endogenous catecholamines has been recognized for decades as a clinical phenomen@@ on@@ . in contrast , reports of myocardial dysfunction due to acute iatrogenic overdose are ra@@ re@@ . a 35 @-@ year @-@ old woman whose cervix uteri was inadver@@ tently injected with 8 mg of epinephrine developed myocardial stun@@ ning that was characterized by severe hemodynamic compromise , profound , albeit transient , left ventricular systolic and diastolic dysfunction , and only modestly elevated biochemical markers of myocardial necro@@ si@@ s. our case illustrates the serious consequences of medical errors that can be avoided through improved medication labeling and staff supervision .
urinary bladder cancer in we@@ gener &apos;s granulomatosis : risks and relation to cycl@@ ophosph@@ am@@ ide@@ . objective : to assess and characterise the risk of bladder cancer , and its relation to cyclophosphamide , in patients with we@@ gener &apos;s granul@@ omat@@ osi@@ s. methods : in the population based , nationwide swe@@ dish inpatient register a cohort of 10@@ 65 patients with we@@ gener &apos;s granulomatosis , 1969 @-@ 95 , was identi@@ fi@@ ed@@ . through linkage with the swe@@ dish cancer register , all subjects in this cohort diagnosed with bladder cancer were identi@@ fi@@ ed@@ . nested within the cohort , a matched case @-@ control study was performed to estimate the association between cyclophosphamide and bladder cancer using odds ratios ( ors ) as relative ris@@ k@@ . in the cohort the cumulative risk of bladder cancer after we@@ gener &apos;s granulomatosis , and the relative prevalence of a history of bladder cancer at the time of diagnosis of we@@ gener &apos;s granulomatosis , were also estim@@ ated@@ . results : the median cumulative doses of cyclophosphamide among cases ( n = 11 ) and controls ( n = 25 ) were 113 g and 25 g , respec@@ ti@@ vel@@ y@@ . the risk of bladder cancer doubled for every 10 g increment in cyclophosphamide ( or = 2.0 , 95 % confidence interval ( ci ) 0.8 to 4.9 ) . treatment duration longer than 1 year was associated with an e@@ ight@@ fold increased risk ( or = 7.7 , 95 % ci 0.9 to 69 ) . the absolute risk for bladder cancer in the cohort reached 10 % 16 years after diagnosis of we@@ gener &apos;s granulomatosis , and a history of bladder cancer was ( non @-@ significantly ) twice as common as expected at the time of diagnosis of we@@ gener &apos;s granul@@ omat@@ osi@@ s. conclusion : the results indicate a dose @-@ response relationship between cyclophosphamide and the risk of bladder cancer , high cumulative risks in the entire cohort , and also the possibility of risk factors operating even before we@@ gener &apos;s granulomatosis .

sequential observations of ex@@ encephaly and subsequent morphological changes by mouse exo utero development system : analysis of the mechanism of transformation from ex@@ encephaly to an@@ enc@@ eph@@ aly@@ . an@@ encephaly has been suggested to develop from ex@@ encephaly ; however , there is little direct experimental evidence to support this , and the mechanism of transformation remains un@@ cl@@ ear@@ . we examined this theory using the exo utero development system that allows direct and sequential observations of mid@@ - to late @-@ gestation mouse embry@@ os@@ . we observed the ex@@ encephaly induced by 5 @-@ az@@ acy@@ tidine at embryonic day 13.5 ( e@@ 13.5 ) , let the embryos develop exo utero until e@@ 18.5 , and re @-@ observed the same embryos at e@@ 18.@@ 5@@ . we confirmed several cases of transformation from ex@@ encephaly to an@@ enc@@ eph@@ aly@@ . however , in many cases , the ex@@ encephalic brain tissue was preserved with more or less reduction during this period@@ . to analyze the transformation patterns , we classified the ex@@ encephaly by size and shape of the ex@@ encephalic tissue into several types at e@@ 13.5 and e@@ 18.@@ 5@@ . it was found that the transformation of ex@@ encephalic tissue was not simply size @-@ dependent , and all cases of an@@ encephaly at e@@ 18.5 resulted from embryos with a large amount of ex@@ encephalic tissue at e@@ 13.@@ 5@@ . microscopic observation showed the configuration of ex@@ encephaly at e@@ 13.5 , frequent hemorrh@@ aging and detachment of the neural plate from surface ectoderm in the ex@@ encephalic head at e@@ 15.5 , and multiple modes of reduction in the ex@@ encephalic tissue at e@@ 18.@@ 5@@ . from observations of the vasculature , altered distribution patterns of vessels were identified in the ex@@ encephalic head@@ . these findings suggest that overgrowth of the ex@@ encephalic neural tissue causes the altered distribution patterns of vessels , subsequent peripheral circulatory failure and / or hemorrh@@ aging in various parts of the ex@@ encephalic head , leading to the multiple modes of tissue reduction during transformation from ex@@ encephaly to an@@ encephaly .
acute cocaine @-@ induced seizures : differential sensitivity of six inbred mouse str@@ ain@@ s. mature male and female mice from six inbred stains were tested for susceptibility to behavioral seizures induced by a single injection of coc@@ ain@@ e. cocaine was injected ip over a range of doses ( 50 @-@ 100 mg / kg ) and behavior was monitored for 20 min@@ ut@@ es@@ . seizure end points included latency to forelimb or hindlimb clon@@ us , latency to clonic running seizure and latency to jumping b@@ oun@@ cing seiz@@ ure@@ . a range of strain specific sensitivities was documented with a / j and s@@ j@@ l mice being most sensitive and c@@ 57@@ b@@ l / 6@@ j most resist@@ ant@@ . d@@ ba / 2@@ j , bal@@ b / c@@ by@@ j and n@@ z@@ w / lac@@ j strains exhibited intermediate sensi@@ tiv@@ it@@ y@@ . e@@ eg recordings were made in s@@ j@@ l , a / j and c@@ 57@@ b@@ l / 6@@ j mice revealing a close correspondence between electrical activity and behavi@@ or@@ . additionally , levels of cocaine determined in hippocampus and cortex were not different between sensitive and resistant str@@ ain@@ s. additional studies of these murine strains may be useful for investigating genetic influences on cocaine @-@ induced seizures .
micro@@ angi@@ opathic hemolytic anemia complicating f@@ k@@ 506 ( tacrolimus ) therap@@ y@@ . we describe 3 episodes of micro@@ angi@@ opathic hemolytic anemia ( ma@@ ha ) in 2 solid organ recipients under f@@ k@@ 506 ( tacrolimus ) therap@@ y@@ . in both cases , discontinuation of f@@ k@@ 506 and treatment with plasma exchange , fresh frozen plasma replacement , corticosteroids , aspirin , and dipyridamole led to resolution of ma@@ ha@@ . in one patient , re@@ introduction of f@@ k@@ 506 led to rapid recurrence of ma@@ ha@@ . f@@ k@@ 506 @-@ associated ma@@ ha is probably rare but physicians must be aware of this severe complic@@ ation@@ . in our experience and according to the literature , f@@ k@@ 506 does not seem to cross @-@ react with cyclosporin a ( cy@@ a ) , an immuno @-@ suppressive drug already known to induce ma@@ ha .
variant ventricular tachycardia in desipramine toxic@@ it@@ y@@ . we report a case of variant ventricular tachycardia induced by desipramine toxic@@ it@@ y@@ . unusual features of the arrhythmia are repetitive group beating , progressive shortening of the r @-@ r interval , progressive widening of the q@@ rs complex with eventual failure of intraventricular conduction , and changes in direction of the q@@ rs ax@@ is@@ . recognition of variant ventricular tachycardia is important because therapy differs from that of classic ventricular tachycardia .

mouse strain @-@ dependent effect of amant@@ adine on motility and brain biogenic amin@@ es@@ . the effect of amant@@ adine hydrochloride , injected i.p. in 6 increments of 100 mg / kg each over 30 hr , on mouse motility and whole brain content of selected biogenic amines and major metabolites was studied in 4 strains of mic@@ e. these were the albino sp@@ rag@@ ue @-@ d@@ aw@@ ley ic@@ r and bal@@ b / c , the black c@@ 57@@ b@@ l / 6 and the brown cd@@ f @-@ i mouse str@@ ain@@ s. amant@@ adine treatment produced a biphasic effect on mouse mo@@ til@@ it@@ y@@ . the initial dose of amant@@ adine depressed locomotor activity in all mouse strains studied with the bal@@ b / c mice being the most sensiti@@ ve@@ . subsequent amant@@ adine treatments produced enhancement of motility from corresponding control in all mouse strains with the bal@@ b / c mice being the least sensiti@@ ve@@ . the locomotor activity was decreased from corresponding controls in all strains studied , except for the ic@@ r mice , during an overnight drug @-@ free period following the fourth amant@@ adine treat@@ ment@@ . re@@ administration of amant@@ adine , after a drug @-@ free overnight period , increased motility from respective saline control in all strains with exception of the bal@@ b / c mice where suppression of motility occur@@ red@@ . treatment with amant@@ adine did not alter whole brain dopamine levels but decreased the amounts of 3,4 @-@ dihydroxy@@ phenylacetic acid in the bal@@ b / c mice compared to saline contro@@ l@@ . conversely , brain nor@@ met@@ aneph@@ rine concentration was increased from saline control by amant@@ adine in the bal@@ b / c mic@@ e. the results suggest a strain @-@ dependent effect of amant@@ adine on motility and indicate a differential response to the acute and multiple dose regimens us@@ ed@@ . the bal@@ b / c mouse was the most sensitive strain and could serve as the strain of choice for evaluating the side effects of amant@@ ad@@ ine@@ . the biochemical results of brain biogenic amines of bal@@ b / c mouse strain suggest a probable decrease of catecholamine turnover rate and / or metabolism by monoamine oxidase and a resulting increase in o @-@ methylation of norepinephrine which may account for a behavioral depression caused by amant@@ adine in the bal@@ b / c mice .
no enhancement by phenobarbital of the hepatocarcin@@ ogenicity of a choline @-@ devoid diet in the rat@@ . an experiment was performed to test whether inclusion of phenobarbital in a choline @-@ devoid diet would increase the hepatocarcin@@ ogenicity of the diet@@ . groups of 5 @-@ week old male f@@ ischer @-@ 344 rats were fed for 7 @-@ 25 months sem@@ ip@@ ur@@ ified choline @-@ devoid or choline @-@ supplemented diets , containing or not 0.06 % phen@@ obarbit@@ al@@ . no hepatic preneoplastic nodules or hepatocellular carcinomas developed in rats fed the plain choline @-@ supplemented diet , while one preneoplastic nodule and one hepatocellular carcinoma developed in two rats fed the same diet containing phen@@ obarbit@@ al@@ . the incidence of preneoplastic nodules and of hepatocellular carcinomas was 10 % and 37 % , respectively , in rats fed the plain choline @-@ devoid diet , and 17 % and 30 % , in rats fed the phenobarbital @-@ containing choline @-@ devoid diet@@ . the results ev@@ inc@@ ed no enhancement of the hepatocarcin@@ ogenicity of the choline @-@ devoid diet by phen@@ obarbit@@ al@@ . sporadic neoplastic lesions were observed in organs other than the liver of some of the animals , irrespective of the diet fed .

dobutamine stress echocardiography : a sensitive indicator of diminished myocardial function in asymptomatic doxorubicin @-@ treated long @-@ term survivors of childhood cancer@@ . doxorubicin is an effective anticancer chemotherapeutic agent known to cause acute and chronic cardiomy@@ opath@@ y@@ . to develop a more sensitive echocardiographic screening test for cardiac damage due to doxorubicin , a cohort study was performed using dobutamine infusion to differentiate asymptomatic long @-@ term survivors of childhood cancer treated with doxorubicin from healthy control subjec@@ ts@@ . echocardiographic data from the experimental group of 21 patients ( mean age 16 + / - 5 years ) treated from 1.6 to 14.3 years ( median 5.3 ) before this study with 27 to 532 mg / m2 of doxorubicin ( mean 196 ) were compared with echocardiographic data from 12 normal age @-@ matched control subjec@@ ts@@ . graded dobutamine infusions of 0.5 , 2.5 , 5 and 10 micrograms / kg per min were admini@@ stere@@ d. echocardiographic dop@@ pler studies were performed before infusion and after 15 min of infusion at each rat@@ e. dobutamine infusion at 10 micrograms / kg per min was discontinued after six studies secondary to a 50 % incidence rate of adverse symptom@@ s. the most important findings were that compared with values in control subjects , end @-@ systolic left ventricular posterior wall dimension and percent of left ventricular posterior wall thickening in doxorubicin @-@ treated patients were decreased at baseline study and these findings were more clearly delineated with dobutamine stimul@@ ation@@ . end @-@ systolic left ventricular posterior wall dimension at baseline for the doxorubicin @-@ treated group was 11 + / - 1.9 mm versus 13.1 + / - 1.5 mm for control subjects ( p less than 0.01 ) . end @-@ systolic left ventricular posterior wall dimension at the 5 @-@ micrograms / kg per min dobutamine infusion for the doxorubicin @-@ treated group was 14.1 + / - 2.4 mm versus 19.3 + / - 2.6 mm for control subjects ( p less than 0.01 ) .

effects of amin@@ ophylline on the threshold for initiating ventricular fibrillation during respiratory fail@@ ure@@ . cardiac arrhythmias have frequently been reported in association with respiratory fail@@ ure@@ . the possible additive role of pharmacologic agents in precipitating cardiac disturbances in patients with respiratory failure has only recently been emphasi@@ z@@ ed@@ . the effects of amin@@ ophylline on the ventricular fibrillation threshold during normal acid @-@ base conditions and during respiratory failure were studied in anesthetized open chest dog@@ s. the ventricular fibrillation threshold was measured by passing a gated train of 12 constant current pulses through the ventricular myocardium during the vulnerable period of the cardiac cycl@@ e. during the infusion of amin@@ ophylline , the ventricular fibrillation threshold was reduced by 30 to 40 percent of the control when ph and partial pressures of oxygen ( po@@ 2 ) and carbon dioxide ( co@@ 2 ) were kept within normal lim@@ it@@ s. when respiratory failure was produced by hypo@@ ventilation ( ph 7.@@ 05 to 7.@@ 25 ; pc@@ 02 70 to 100 mm h@@ g : p@@ 02 20 to 40 mm h@@ g ) , infusion of amin@@ ophylline resulted in an even greater decrease in ventricular fibrillation threshold to 60 percent of the control lev@@ el@@ . these experiments suggest that although many factors may contribute to the increased incidence of ventricular arrhythmias in respiratory failure , pharmacologic agents , particularly amin@@ ophylline , may play a significant role .
case report : acute unintentional carbachol intox@@ ic@@ ation@@ . introduction : intox@@ ications with carbachol , a muscarinic cholinergic receptor agonist are ra@@ re@@ . we report an interesting case investigating a ( near ) fatal pois@@ on@@ ing@@ . methods : the son of an 84 @-@ year @-@ old male discovered a new@@ sp@@ aper report st@@ ating clinical success with plant extracts in al@@ z@@ heimer &apos;s dise@@ as@@ e. the mode of action was said to be comparable to that of the synthetic compound &apos; carbam@@ yl@@ chol@@ in &apos; ; that is , carb@@ ach@@ ol@@ . he b@@ ought 25 g of carbachol as pure substance in a pharmacy , and the father was administered 400 to 500 m@@ g. carbachol concentrations in serum and urine on day 1 and 2 of hospital admission were analysed by h@@ pl@@ c @-@ mass spectro@@ metr@@ y@@ . results : minutes after oral administration , the patient developed nausea , sweating and hypotension , and finally collap@@ sed@@ . bradycardia , cholinergic symptoms and as@@ yst@@ ole occur@@ red@@ . initial cardiopulmonary resuscitation and immediate treatment with adrenaline ( epinephrine ) , atropine and furosemide was success@@ ful@@ . on hospital admission , blood pressure of the intubated , brady@@ arrhythmic patient was 100 / 65 mm@@ h@@ g. further signs were hyper@@ hidrosis , hyper@@ saliv@@ ation , bronch@@ orrho@@ ea , and severe mi@@ osis ; the electrocardiographic finding was atri@@ o @-@ ventricular dissoci@@ ation@@ . high doses of atropine ( up to 50 mg per 24 hours ) , adrenaline and dopamine were necess@@ ary@@ . the patient was ex@@ tub@@ ated 1 week later@@ . however , increased dyspnoea and bronch@@ ospasm necessitated rein@@ tub@@ ation@@ . respiratory insufficiency was further worsened by prote@@ us mirabilis infection and severe broncho@@ constric@@ tion@@ . one week later , the patient was again ex@@ tub@@ ated and 3 days later was transferred to a peripheral war@@ d. on the next day he died , probably as a result of heart fail@@ ure@@ . serum samples from the first and second days contained 3.6 and 1.9 mg / l carbachol , respec@@ ti@@ vel@@ y@@ . the corresponding urine concentrations amounted to 374 and 5@@ 54 mg / l@@ . conclusion : this case started with a media report in a popular new@@ sp@@ aper , initiated by published , peer @-@ reviewed research on her@@ b@@ als , and involved human failure in a case history , medical examination and clinical treat@@ ment@@ . for the first time , an analytical method for the determination of carbachol in plasma and urine has been develop@@ ed@@ . the analysed carbachol concentration exceeded the supposed serum level resulting from a therapeutic dose by a factor of 130 to 2@@ 60@@ . especially in old patients , intensi@@ vi@@ sts should consider intox@@ ications ( with cholin@@ erg@@ ics ) as a cause of acute cardiovascular failure .
crossover comparison of efficacy and preference for r@@ iz@@ at@@ riptan 10 mg versus erg@@ ot@@ amine / caffeine in migra@@ ine@@ . r@@ iz@@ at@@ riptan is a selective 5 @-@ h@@ t ( 1b / 1d ) receptor agonist with rapid oral absorption and early onset of action in the acute treatment of migra@@ ine@@ . this randomized double@@ - blind crossover outpatient study assessed the preference for 1 r@@ iz@@ at@@ riptan 10 mg tablet to 2 erg@@ ot@@ amine 1 mg / caffeine 100 mg tablets in 439 patients treating a single migraine attack with each therap@@ y@@ . of patients expressing a preference ( 8@@ 9.1 % ) , more than twice as many preferred r@@ iz@@ at@@ riptan to erg@@ ot@@ amine / caffeine ( 6@@ 9.9 vs. 30.1 % , p &lt; or = 0.001 ) . faster relief of headache was the most important reason for preference , cited by 6@@ 7.3 % of patients preferring r@@ iz@@ at@@ riptan and 5@@ 4.2 % of patients who preferred erg@@ ot@@ amine / caffe@@ ine@@ . the co @-@ primary endpoint of being pain free at 2 h was also in favor of r@@ iz@@ at@@ rip@@ tan@@ . forty @-@ nine percent of patients were pain free 2 h after r@@ iz@@ at@@ riptan , compared with 24.3 % treated with erg@@ ot@@ amine / caffeine ( p &lt; or = 0.001 ) , r@@ iz@@ at@@ riptan being superior within 1 h of treat@@ ment@@ . headache relief at 2 h was 7@@ 5.9 % for r@@ iz@@ at@@ riptan and 4@@ 7.3 % for erg@@ ot@@ amine / caffeine ( p &lt; or = 0.001 ) , with r@@ iz@@ at@@ riptan being superior to erg@@ ot@@ amine / caffeine within 30 min of dos@@ ing@@ . almost 36 % of patients taking r@@ iz@@ at@@ riptan were pain free at 2 h and had no recurrence or need for additional medication within 24 h , compared to 20 % of patients on erg@@ ot@@ amine / caffeine ( p &lt; or = 0.001 ) . r@@ iz@@ at@@ riptan was also superior to erg@@ ot@@ amine / caffeine in the proportions of patients with no nausea , vomiting , phon@@ ophobia or phot@@ ophobia and for patients with normal function 2 h after drug intake ( p &lt; or = 0.001 ) . more patients were ( completely , very or somewhat ) satisfied 2 h after treatment with r@@ iz@@ at@@ riptan ( 6@@ 9.8 % ) than at 2 h after treatment with erg@@ ot@@ amine / caffeine ( 38.6 % , p &lt; or = 0.001 ) . recurrence rates were 31.4 % with r@@ iz@@ at@@ riptan and 15.3 % with erg@@ ot@@ amine / caffe@@ ine@@ . both active treatments were well toler@@ ated@@ . the most common adverse events ( incidence &gt; or = 5 % in one group ) after r@@ iz@@ at@@ riptan and erg@@ ot@@ amine / caffeine , respectively , were dizziness ( 6.7 and 5.3 % ) , nausea ( 4.2 and 8.5 % ) and somn@@ olence ( 5.5 and 2.3 % ) .
thrombotic microangiopathy and renal failure associated with antineoplastic chemo@@ therap@@ y@@ . five patients with carcinoma developed thrombotic microangiopathy ( characterized by renal insufficiency , micro@@ angi@@ opathic hemolytic anemia , and usually thrombocytopenia ) after treatment with cisplatin , bleomycin , and a v@@ inc@@ a alkal@@ oid@@ . one patient had thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura , three the hemolytic @-@ uremic syndrome , and one an apparent forme fru@@ ste of one of these dis@@ or@@ der@@ s. histologic examination of the renal tissue showed evidence of intravascular coagulation , primarily affecting the small arteries , arterioles , and glomerul@@ i. because each patient was tumor @-@ free or had only a small tumor at the onset of this syndrome , the thrombotic microangiopathy may have been induced by chemo@@ therap@@ y@@ . diagnosis of this potentially fatal complication may be delayed or missed if renal tissue or the peripheral blood smear is not examined , because renal failure may be ascribed to cisplatin nephrotoxicity and the anemia and thrombocytopenia to drug @-@ induced bone marrow suppression .
salvage therapy with n@@ el@@ arabine , etoposide , and cyclophosphamide in relapsed / refractory paediatric t @-@ cell lymphoblastic leukaemia and lymph@@ om@@ a. a combination of 5 d of n@@ el@@ arabine ( ar@@ ag ) with 5 d of etoposide ( v@@ p ) and cyclophosphamide ( c@@ pm ) and prophylactic intrathecal chemotherapy was used as salvage therapy in seven children with refractory or relapsed t @-@ cell leukaemia or lymph@@ om@@ a. the most common side effects attributable to the ar@@ ag included grade 2 and 3 sensory and motor neuropathy and musculoskeletal pain@@ . haematological toxicity was greater for the combination than ar@@ ag alone , although median time to neutrophil and platelet recovery was consistent with other salvage therap@@ i@@ es@@ . all patients had some response to the combined therapy and five of the seven went into complete remission after one or two courses of ar@@ ag / v@@ p / cp@@ m. our experience supports the safety of giving ar@@ ag as salvage therapy in synchrony with etoposide and cyclophosphamide , although neurological toxicity must be closely monitored .

can angiogenesis be a target of treatment for ribavirin associated hemolytic anemia ? background / aims : recently ribavirin has been found to inhibit angiogenesis and a number of angiogenesis inhibitors such as sunitinib and sorafenib have been found to cause acute hem@@ ol@@ ysi@@ s. we aimed to investigate whether there is a relation between hemoglobin , haptoglobin and angiogenesis soluble markers which are modifiable and can help in developing strategies against an@@ em@@ i@@ a. methods : fourteen patients chronically infected with hepatitis c virus were treated by pegylated interferon alpha 2a and rib@@ avir@@ in@@ . serum hemoglobin , haptoglobin and angiogenesis markers of vascular endothelial growth factor and angi@@ opo@@ etin @-@ 2 were investigated before and after therap@@ y@@ . results : we observed a significant decrease in haptoglobin levels at the end of the treatment period@@ . hemoglobin levels also decreased but in@@ significantly by treat@@ ment@@ . in contrast with the literature , serum levels of angiogenesis factors did not change significantly by pegylated interferon and ribavirin therap@@ y@@ . we found no correlation of angiogenesis soluble markers with either hemoglobin or hap@@ t@@ oglobin@@ . conclusion : this is the first study in the literature investigating a link between angiogenesis soluble markers and ribavirin induced anemia in patients with hepatitis c and we could not find any relati@@ on@@ . future research with larger number of patients is needed to find out modifiable factors that will improve the safety of ribavirin therapy .
cocaine causes memory and learning impairments in rats : involvement of nuclear factor kappa b and oxidative stress , and prevention by top@@ ir@@ am@@ at@@ e. different mechanisms have been suggested for cocaine toxicity including an increase in oxidative stress but the association between oxidative status in the brain and cocaine induced @-@ behaviour is poorly underst@@ o@@ od@@ . nuclear factor kappa b ( n@@ f@@ kappa@@ b ) is a sensor of oxidative stress and participates in memory formation that could be involved in drug toxicity and addiction mechanis@@ m@@ s. therefore n@@ f@@ kappa@@ b activity , oxidative stress , neuronal nitric oxide synthase ( n@@ nos ) activity , spatial learning and memory as well as the effect of topiramate , a previously proposed therapy for cocaine addiction , were evaluated in an experimental model of cocaine administration in rat@@ s. n@@ f@@ kappa@@ b activity was decreased in the frontal cortex of cocaine treated rats , as well as g@@ sh concentration and glutathione peroxidase activity in the hippocampus , whereas n@@ nos activity in the hippocampus was incre@@ as@@ ed@@ . memory retrieval of experiences acquired prior to cocaine administration was impaired and negatively correlated with n@@ f@@ kappa@@ b activity in the frontal cor@@ tex@@ . in contrast , learning of new tasks was enhanced and correlated with the increase of n@@ nos activity and the decrease of glutathione per@@ oxid@@ as@@ e. these results provide evidence for a possible mechanistic role of oxidative and nitros@@ ative stress and n@@ f@@ kappa@@ b in the alterations induced by coc@@ ain@@ e. topiramate prevented all the alterations observed , showing novel neuroprotective properties .

curcumin ameliorates cognitive dysfunction and oxidative damage in phen@@ obarbitone and carbamazepine administered rat@@ s. the antiepileptic drugs , phen@@ obarbitone and carbamazepine are well known to cause cognitive impairment on chronic use@@ . the increase in free radical generation has been implicated as one of the important mechanisms of cognitive impairment by antiepileptic dru@@ g@@ s. curcumin has shown antioxidant , anti @-@ inflammatory and neuro @-@ protective proper@@ ti@@ es@@ . therefore , the present study was carried out to investigate the effect of chronic curcumin administration on phen@@ obarb@@ itone@@ - and carbamazepine @-@ induced cognitive impairment and oxidative stress in rat@@ s. pharmacokinetic interactions of curcumin with phen@@ obarbitone and carbamazepine were also studi@@ ed@@ . vehicle / drugs were administered daily for 21@@ days to male w@@ istar rat@@ s. passive avoidance paradigm and elevated plus maze test were used to assess cognitive function@@ . at the end of study period , serum phen@@ obarbitone and carbamazepine , whole brain malondialdehyde and reduced glutathione levels were estim@@ ated@@ . the administration of phen@@ obarbitone and carbamazepine for 21@@ days caused a significant impairment of learning and memory as well as an increased oxidative stress@@ . concomitant curcumin administration prevented the cognitive impairment and decreased the increased oxidative stress induced by these antiepileptic dru@@ g@@ s. curcumin co @-@ administration did not cause any significant alteration in the serum concentrations of both phen@@ obarbitone as well as carbam@@ azep@@ ine@@ . these results show that curcumin has beneficial effect in mitigating the deterioration of cognitive functions and oxidative damage in rats treated with phen@@ obarbitone and carbamazepine without significantly altering their serum concentr@@ ation@@ s. the findings suggest that curcumin can be considered as a potential safe and effective adjuvant to phen@@ obarbitone and carbamazepine therapy in preventing cognitive impairment associated with these drugs .
pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate protects the pir@@ iform cortex in the pilocarpine status epilepticus mod@@ el@@ . pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate ( p@@ d@@ t@@ c ) has a dual mechanism of action as an antioxidant and an inhibitor of the transcription factor kappa @-@ beta@@ . both , production of reactive oxygen species as well as activation of n@@ f @-@ kappa@@ b have been implicated in severe neuronal damage in different sub @-@ regions of the hippocampus as well as in the surrounding cortic@@ es@@ . the effect of p@@ d@@ t@@ c on status epilepticus @-@ associated cell loss in the hippocampus and pir@@ iform cortex was evaluated in the rat fractionated pilocarpine mod@@ el@@ . treatment with 150 mg / kg p@@ d@@ t@@ c before and following status epilepticus significantly increased the mortality rate to 100 % . administration of 50 mg / kg p@@ d@@ t@@ c ( low @-@ dose ) did not exert major effects on the development of a status epilepticus or the mortality rat@@ e. in vehicle @-@ treated rats , status epilepticus caused pronounced neuronal damage in the pir@@ iform cortex comprising both pyramidal cells and inter@@ neuron@@ s. low @-@ dose p@@ d@@ t@@ c treatment almost completely protected from lesions in the pir@@ iform cor@@ tex@@ . a significant decrease in neuronal density of the hippocampal hilar formation was identified in veh@@ ic@@ le- and p@@ d@@ t@@ c @-@ treated rats following status epilep@@ tic@@ us@@ . in conclusion , the n@@ f @-@ kappa@@ b inhibitor and antioxidant p@@ d@@ t@@ c protected the pir@@ iform cortex , whereas it did not affect hilar neuronal los@@ s. these data might indicate that the generation of reactive oxygen species and activation of n@@ f @-@ kappa@@ b plays a more central role in seizure @-@ associated neuronal damage in the temporal cortex as compared to the hippocampal hil@@ us@@ . however , future investigations are necessary to exactly analyze the biochemical mechanisms by which p@@ d@@ t@@ c exerted its beneficial effects in the pir@@ iform cortex .

the effects of the adjunctive bupropion on male sexual dysfunction induced by a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor : a double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled and randomized stud@@ y@@ . objective : to determine the safety and efficacy of adjunctive bupropion sustained @-@ release ( s@@ r ) on male sexual dysfunction ( sd ) induced by a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( ss@@ ri ) , as sd is a common side @-@ effect of ss@@ ris and the most effective treatments have yet to be determin@@ ed@@ . patients and methods : the randomized sample consisted of 234 eu@@ thymic men who were receiving some type of ss@@ ri@@ . the men were randomly assigned to bupropion s@@ r ( 150 mg twice daily , 117 ) or placebo ( twice daily , 117 ) for 12 week@@ s. efficacy was evaluated using the clinical global impression @-@ sexual function ( c@@ gi @-@ s@@ f ; the primary outcome measure ) , the international index of erectile function ( i@@ ief ) , ar@@ izona sexual experience scale ( as@@ ex ) , and erectile dysfunction inventory of treatment satisfaction ( ed@@ its ) ( secondary outcome measures ) . participants were followed bi@@ weekly during study period@@ . results : after 12 weeks of treatment , the mean ( sd ) scores for c@@ gi @-@ s@@ f were significantly lower , i.e. better , in patients on bupropion s@@ r , at 2.4 ( 1.2 ) , than in the placebo group , at 3.9 ( 1.1 ) ( p = 0.01 ) . men who received bupropion had a significant increase in the total i@@ ief score ( 5@@ 4.4 % vs 1.2 % ; p = 0.003 ) , and in the five different domains of the i@@ ie@@ f@@ . total as@@ ex scores were significantly lower , i.e. better , among men who received bupropion than placebo , at 15.5 ( 4.3 ) vs 21.5 ( 4.7 ) ( p = 0.002 ) . the ed@@ its scores were 6@@ 7.4 ( 10.2 ) for the bupropion and 36.3 ( 11.7 ) for the placebo group ( p = 0.001 ) . the as@@ ex score and c@@ gi @-@ s@@ f score were correlated ( p = 0.003 ) . in linear regression analyses the c@@ gi @-@ s@@ f score was not affected significantly by the duration of sd , type of ss@@ ri used and ag@@ e. conclusions : bupropion is an effective treatment for male sd induced by ss@@ ris@@ . these results provide empirical support for conducting a further study of bupropion .
lamivudine for the prevention of hepatitis b virus reactivation in hepatitis @-@ b surface antigen ( h@@ b@@ sa@@ g ) seropositive cancer patients undergoing cytotoxic chemo@@ therap@@ y@@ . hepatitis b virus ( h@@ b@@ v ) is one of the major causes of chronic liver disease worl@@ d@@ wide@@ . cancer patients who are chronic carriers of h@@ b@@ v have a higher hepatic complication rate while receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy ( ct ) and this has mainly been attributed to h@@ b@@ v re@@ activ@@ ation@@ . in this study , cancer patients who have solid and hematological malignancies with chronic h@@ b@@ v infection received the antiviral agent lamivudine prior and during ct compared with historical control group who did not receive lam@@ iv@@ ud@@ ine@@ . the objectives were to assess the efficacy of lamivudine in reducing the incidence of h@@ b@@ v reactivation , and diminishing morbidity and mortality during ct@@ . two groups were compared in this stud@@ y@@ . the prophylactic lam@@ iv@@ udin group consisted of 37 patients who received prophylactic lamivudine treat@@ ment@@ . the historical controls consisted of 50 consecutive patients who underwent ct without prophylactic lam@@ iv@@ ud@@ ine@@ . they were followed up during and for 8 weeks after ct@@ . the outcomes were compared for both grou@@ ps@@ . of our control group ( n = 50 ) , 21 patients ( 42 % ) were established hepati@@ tis@@ . twelve ( 24 % ) of them were evaluated as severe hepati@@ tis@@ . in the prophylactic lamivudine group severe hepatitis were observed only in 1 patient ( 2.7 % ) of 37 patients ( p &lt; 0.006 ) . comparison of the mean alt values revealed significantly higher mean alanine aminotransferase ( alt ) values in the control group than the prophylactic lamivudine group ; 154 : 64 ( p &lt; 0.32 ) . our study suggests that prophylactic lamivudine significantly decreases the incidence of h@@ b@@ v reactivation and overall morbidity in cancer patients during and after immunosuppressive therap@@ y@@ . further studies are needed to determine the most appropriate nucleoside or nucleotide analogue for antiviral prophylaxis during ct and the optimal duration of administration after completion of ct .
ginsenoside r@@ g1 restores the impairment of learning induced by chronic morphine administration in rat@@ s. r@@ g1 , as a ginsenoside extracted from pan@@ ax ginseng , could ameliorate spatial learning impair@@ ment@@ . previous studies have demonstrated that r@@ g1 might be a useful agent for the prevention and treatment of the adverse effects of morph@@ ine@@ . the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of r@@ g1 on learning impairment by chronic morphine administration and the mechanism responsible for this effec@@ t. male rats were subcutaneously injected with morphine ( 10 mg / kg ) twice a day at 12 hour intervals for 10 days , and r@@ g1 ( 30 mg / kg ) was intraperitoneally injected 2 hours after the second injection of morphine once a day for 10 day@@ s. spatial learning capacity was assessed in the mor@@ ris water maz@@ e. the results showed that rats treated with morphine / r@@ g1 decreased escape latency and increased the time spent in platform quadrant and entering frequ@@ enc@@ y@@ . by implantation of electrodes and electrophysiological recording in vivo , the results showed that r@@ g1 restored the long @-@ term potentiation ( l@@ t@@ p ) impaired by morphine in both freely moving and anaesthe@@ tised rat@@ s. the electrophysiological recording in vitro showed that r@@ g1 restored the l@@ t@@ p in slices from the rats treated with morphine , but not changed l@@ t@@ p in the slices from normal sal@@ ine- or morphine / r@@ g1 @-@ treated rats ; this restoration could be inhibited by n @-@ methyl @-@ d @-@ aspartate ( nm@@ da ) receptor antagonist m@@ k@@ 80@@ 1@@ . we conclude that r@@ g1 may significantly improve the spatial learning capacity impaired by ch@@ onic morphine administration and restore the morphine @-@ inhibited l@@ t@@ p. this effect is nm@@ da receptor dependent .
a study on the effect of the duration of subcutaneous heparin injection on bru@@ ising and pain@@ . aim : this study was carried out to determine the effect of injection duration on bru@@ ising and pain following the administration of the subcutaneous injection of hepar@@ in@@ . background : although different methods to prevent bru@@ ising and pain following the subcutaneous injection of heparin have been widely studied and described , the effect of injection duration on the occurrence of bru@@ ising and pain is little docum@@ ente@@ d. design : this study was designed as within @-@ subject , quasi @-@ experimental resear@@ ch@@ . method : the sample for the study consisted of 50 patients to whom subcutaneous heparin was admini@@ stere@@ d. heparin was injected over 10 seconds on the right abdominal site and 30 seconds on the left abdominal sit@@ e. injections areas were assessed for the presence of bru@@ ising at 48 and 72 hours after each injec@@ tion@@ . dimensions of the bru@@ ising on the heparin applied areas were measured using transparent mill@@ imetric measuring pap@@ er@@ . the visual analog scale ( vas ) was used to measure pain intensity and a stop @-@ w@@ atch was used to time the pain period@@ . data were analysed using chi @-@ square test , mann @-@ whit@@ ney u , wil@@ cox@@ on signed ranks tests and cor@@ relati@@ on@@ . results : the percentage of bru@@ ising occurrence was 64 % with the injection of 10 seconds duration and 42 % in the 30 @-@ second injec@@ tion@@ . it was determined that the size of the bru@@ ising was smaller in the 30 @-@ second injec@@ tion@@ . pain intensity and pain period were statistically significantly lower for the 30 @-@ second injection than for the 10 @-@ second injec@@ tion@@ . conclusions : it was determined that injection duration had an effect on bru@@ ising and pain following the subcutaneous administration of hepar@@ in@@ . this study should be repeated on a larger sam@@ pl@@ e. relevance to clinical practice : when administering subcutaneous heparin injections , it is important to extend the duration of the injection .
acute reserpine and subchronic haloperidol treatments change synaptosomal brain glutamate uptake and elicit orofacial dyskinesia in rat@@ s. reser@@ p@@ ine- and haloperidol @-@ induced orofacial dyskinesia are putative animal models of tardive dyskinesia ( t@@ d ) whose pathophysiology has been related to free radical generation and oxidative stress@@ . in the present study , the authors induced orofacial dyskinesia by acute reserpine and subchronic haloperidol administration to rat@@ s. reserpine injection ( one dose of 1 mg / kg s.c. ) every other day for 3 days caused a significant increase in vacu@@ ous chewing , tongue protrusion and duration of facial tw@@ itching , compared to the contro@@ l@@ . haloperidol administration ( one dose of 12 mg / kg once a week s.c. ) for 4 weeks caused an increase in vacu@@ ous chewing , tongue protrusion and duration of facial tw@@ itching observed in four weekly evalu@@ ation@@ s. after the treatments and behavioral observation , glutamate uptake by segments of the brain was analy@@ z@@ ed@@ . a decreased glutamate uptake was observed in the subcortical parts of animals treated with reserpine and haloperidol , compared to the contro@@ l@@ . importantly , a decrease in glutamate uptake correlates negatively with an increase in the incidence of orofacial dis@@ kine@@ si@@ a. these results indicate that early changes in glutamate transport may be related to the development of vacu@@ ous chewing movements in rats .
acute psychosis due to treatment with phenytoin in a non@@ epileptic patient@@ . the development of psychosis related to antiepileptic drug treatment is usually attributed to the interaction between the epileptic brain substratum and the antiepileptic dru@@ g@@ s. the case of a non@@ epileptic patient who developed psychosis following phenytoin treatment for trigeminal neuralgia is describ@@ ed@@ . this case suggests that the psychotic symptoms that occur following phenytoin treatment in some epileptic patients may be the direct result of medication , unrelated to seizures .
the effect of treatment with gum arab@@ ic on gentamicin nephrotoxicity in rats : a preliminary stud@@ y@@ . in the present work we assessed the effect of treatment of rats with gum arab@@ ic on acute renal failure induced by gentamicin ( gm ) nephro@@ toxic@@ it@@ y@@ . rats were treated with the vehicle ( 2 ml / kg of distilled water and 5 % w / v cellulose , 10 days ) , gum arab@@ ic ( 2 ml / kg of a 10 % w / v aqueous suspension of gum arab@@ ic powder , orally for 10 days ) , or gum arab@@ ic concomitantly with gm ( 80@@ mg / kg / day intramuscularly , during the last six days of the treatment period ) . nephrotoxicity was assessed by measuring the concentrations of creatinine and urea in the plasma and reduced glutathione ( g@@ sh ) in the kidney cortex , and by light microscopic examination of kidney sec@@ tion@@ s. the results indicated that concomitant treatment with gum arab@@ ic and gm significantly increased creatinine and urea by about 183 and 239 % , respectively ( compared to 432 and 346 % , respectively , in rats treated with cellulose and gm ) , and decreased that of cortical g@@ sh by 21 % ( compared to 27 % in the cellulose plus gm group ) the gm @-@ induced proximal tubular necrosis appeared to be slightly less severe in rats given gm together with gum arab@@ ic than in those given gm and cellul@@ os@@ e. it could be inferred that gum arab@@ ic treatment has induced a modest amelioration of some of the histological and biochemical indices of gm nephro@@ toxic@@ it@@ y@@ . further work is warranted on the effect of the treatments on renal functional aspects in models of chronic renal failure , and on the mechanism ( s ) involved .
visual hallucinations associated with zon@@ is@@ am@@ ide@@ . zon@@ is@@ amide is a broad @-@ spectrum antiepileptic drug used to treat various types of seiz@@ u@@ res@@ . although visual hallucinations have not been reported as an adverse effect of this agent , we describe three patients who experienced complex visual hallucinations and altered mental status after zon@@ is@@ amide treatment was begun or its dosage incre@@ as@@ ed@@ . all three had been diagnosed earlier with epilepsy , and their electroencephalogram ( e@@ eg ) findings were abnormal@@ . during monitoring , visual hallucinations did not correlate with e@@ eg readings , nor did video recording capture any of the described event@@ s. none of the patients had experienced visual hallucinations before this event@@ . the only recent change in their treatment was the introduction or increased dosage of zon@@ is@@ am@@ ide@@ . with either discontinuation or decreased dosage of the drug the symptoms disappeared and did not recur@@ . further observations and reports will help clarify this adverse effec@@ t. until then , clinicians need to be aware of this possible complication associated with zon@@ is@@ amide .
g@@ lep@@ p1 receptor tyrosine phosphatase ( pt@@ pro ) in rat pan nephro@@ si@@ s. a marker of acute podocyte injur@@ y@@ . glomerular epithelial protein 1 ( g@@ lep@@ p1 ) is a podocyte receptor membrane protein tyrosine phosphatase located on the apical cell membrane of visceral glomerular epithelial cell and foot process@@ es@@ . this receptor plays a role in regulating the structure and function of podocyte foot process@@ . to better understand the utility of g@@ lep@@ p1 as a marker of glomerular injury , the amount and distribution of g@@ lep@@ p1 protein and m@@ r@@ na were examined by immunohistochemistry , western blot and r@@ n@@ ase protection assay in a model of podocyte injury in the rat@@ . puromycin amin@@ onucle@@ oside neph@@ rosis was induced by single intraperitoneal injection of puromycin amin@@ onucle@@ oside ( pan , 20 mg / 100@@ g bw ) . tissues were analyzed at 0 , 5 , 7 , 11 , 21 , 45 , 80 and 126 days after pan injection so as to include both the acute phase of proteinuria associated with foot process eff@@ ac@@ ement ( days 5 @-@ 11 ) and the chronic phase of proteinuria associated with glomerulosclerosis ( days 45 @-@ 126 ) . at day 5 , g@@ lep@@ p1 protein and m@@ r@@ na were reduced from the normal range ( 26@@ 5.2 + / - 7@@ 9.6 x 10 ( 6 ) moles / glomerul@@ us and 100 % ) to 15 % of normal ( 4@@ 1.8 + / - 4.8 x 10 ( 6 ) moles / glomerul@@ us , p &lt; 0.005 ) . this occurred in association with an increase in urinary protein content from 1.8 + / - 1 to 9@@ 9.0 + / - 61 mg / day ( p &lt; 0.001 ) . in contrast , po@@ doc@@ aly@@ xin did not change significantly at this time@@ . by day 11 , g@@ lep@@ p1 protein and m@@ r@@ na had begun to return towards bas@@ el@@ ine@@ . by day 45 @-@ 126 , at a time when glomerular scarring was present , g@@ lep@@ p1 was absent from glomerul@@ osclerotic areas although the total glomerular content of g@@ lep@@ p1 was not different from normal@@ . we conclude that g@@ lep@@ p1 expression , unlike po@@ doc@@ aly@@ xin , reflects podocyte injury induced by pan@@ . g@@ lep@@ p1 expression may be a useful marker of podocyte injury .
ti@@ clop@@ idine @-@ induced aplastic anemia : report of three chin@@ ese patients and review of the liter@@ at@@ ure@@ . in this study , three chin@@ ese patients with ti@@ clop@@ idine @-@ induced aplastic anemia were reported and another 13 patients in the en@@ gl@@ ish literature were revie@@ wed@@ . we attempted to find underlying similarities , evaluate the risk factors , and identify appropriate treatment for this complic@@ ation@@ . all but one of the patients were over 60 years old , and the 6 who died were all older than 65@@ . therefore , old age may be a risk factor for developing this complic@@ ation@@ . agran@@ ul@@ ocytosis occurred 3 @-@ 20 weeks after initiation of ti@@ clop@@ idine , so frequent examination of white cell count during treatment is recomm@@ ende@@ d. there seemed to be no direct correlation between the dose or duration used and the severity of bone marrow sup@@ pres@@ sion@@ . treatment for ti@@ clop@@ idine @-@ induced aplastic anemia with colony @-@ stimulating factors seemed to have little effec@@ t. the fact that 5 of the 6 patients who received concurrent calcium channel blockers died , should alert clinicians to be more cautious when using these two drugs simultaneously .
facilitation of memory retrieval by pre @-@ test morphine and its state dependency in the step @-@ through type passive avoidance learning test in mic@@ e. amnesia produced by scopolamine and cycloheximide were reversed by morphine given 30 min before the test trial ( pre @-@ test ) , and pre @-@ test morphine also facilitated the memory retrieval in the animals administered naloxone during the training tri@@ al@@ . similarly , pre @-@ test scopolamine partially reversed the scopolamine @-@ induced amnesia , but not significantly ; and pre @-@ test cycloheximide failed to reverse the cycloheximide @-@ induced amne@@ si@@ a. these results suggest that the facilitation of memory retrieval by pre @-@ test morphine might be the direct action of morphine rather than a state dependent effect .
test conditions influence the response to a drug challenge in ro@@ dent@@ s. these studies were conducted to examine the differential response to a drug challenge under varied experimental test conditions routinely employed to study drug @-@ induced behavioral and neurophysiological responses in ro@@ dent@@ s. apomorphine , a nonselective dopamine agonist , was selected due to its biphasic behavioral effects , its ability to induce hypothermia , and to produce distinct changes to dopamine turnover in the rodent bra@@ in@@ . from such experiments there is evidence that characterization and detection of apomorphine @-@ induced activity in rodents critically depends upon the test conditions employ@@ ed@@ . in rats , detection of apomorphine @-@ induced hyperactivity was facilitated by a period of acclim@@ atization to the test condi@@ tion@@ s. moreover , test conditions can impact upon other physiological responses to apomorphine such as drug @-@ induced hypo@@ ther@@ mi@@ a. in mice , apomorphine produced qualitatively different responses under novel conditions when compared to those behaviors elicited in the home test c@@ ag@@ e. drug @-@ induced gross activity counts were increased in the novel exploratory box only , while measures of stere@@ otypic behavior were similar in bo@@ th@@ . by contrast , apomorphine @-@ induced locomotion was more prominent in the novel exploratory b@@ ox@@ . dopamine turnover ratios ( dop@@ ac : da and h@@ va : da ) were found to be lower in those animals exposed to the exploratory box when compared to their home cage counter@@ part@@ s. however , apomorphine @-@ induced reductions in striatal dopamine turnover were detected in both novel and home cage environ@@ ment@@ s. the implications of these findings are discussed with particular emphasis upon conducting psychopharmac@@ ological challenge tests in rodents .
