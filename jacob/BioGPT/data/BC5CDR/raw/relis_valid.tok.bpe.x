tricuspid valve regurgitation and lithium carbonate toxicity in a newborn inf@@ ant@@ . a newborn with massive tricuspid regurgitation , atrial flutter , congestive heart failure , and a high serum lithium level is describ@@ ed@@ . this is the first patient to initially manifest tricuspid regurgitation and atrial flutter , and the 11@@ th described patient with cardiac disease among infants exposed to lithium compounds in the first trimester of pregn@@ anc@@ y@@ . sixty @-@ three percent of these infants had tricuspid valve invol@@ v@@ ement@@ . lithium carbonate may be a factor in the increasing incidence of congenital heart disease when taken during early pregn@@ anc@@ y@@ . it also causes neurologic depression , cyan@@ osis , and cardiac arrhythmia when consumed prior to delivery .
phenobarbital @-@ induced dyskinesia in a neurologically @-@ impaired child@@ . a 2 @-@ year @-@ old child with known neurologic impairment developed a dyskinesia soon after starting phenobarbital therapy for seiz@@ u@@ res@@ . known causes of movement disorders were eliminated after evalu@@ ation@@ . on repeat challenge with phenobarbital , the dyskinesia recur@@ red@@ . phenobarbital should be added to the list of anticonvulsant drugs that can cause movement disorders .
acute changes of blood ammonia may predict short @-@ term adverse effects of valproic acid@@ . valproic acid ( v@@ pa ) was given to 24 epileptic patients who were already being treated with other antiepileptic dru@@ g@@ s. a standardized loading dose of v@@ pa was administered , and venous blood was sampled at 0 , 1 , 2 , 3 , and 4 hour@@ s. ammonia ( n@@ h@@ 3 ) was higher in patients who , during continuous therapy , complained of drow@@ siness ( 7 patients ) than in those who were symptom @-@ free ( 17 patients ) , although v@@ pa plasma levels were similar in both grou@@ ps@@ . by measuring v@@ pa @-@ induced changes of blood n@@ h@@ 3 content , it may be possible to identify patients at higher risk of ob@@ t@@ und@@ ation when v@@ pa is given chronically .
effects of calcitonin on rat extrapyramidal motor system : behavioral and biochemical dat@@ a. the effects of i.@@ v@@ .@@ c. injection of human and salmon calcitonin on biochemical and behavioral parameters related to the extrapyramidal motor system , were investigated in male rat@@ s. calcitonin injection resulted in a potentiation of haloperidol @-@ induced catal@@ epsy and a partial prevention of apomorphine @-@ induced hyper@@ activ@@ it@@ y@@ . moreover calcitonin induced a significant decrease in nig@@ ral g@@ ad activity but no change in striatal da and dop@@ ac concentration or g@@ ad activ@@ it@@ y@@ . the results are discussed in view of a primary action of calcitonin on the stri@@ at@@ on@@ ig@@ ral gab@@ a@@ ergic pathway mediating the da @-@ related behavioral messages of striatal origin .
development of isoproterenol @-@ induced cardiac hypertroph@@ y@@ . the development of cardiac hypertrophy was studied in adult female w@@ istar rats following daily subcutaneous injections of isoproterenol ( iso ) ( 0.3 mg / kg body weight ) . a time course was established for the change in tissue mass , r@@ na and d@@ na content , as well as hydroxyproline cont@@ ent@@ . heart weight increased 44 % after 8 days of treatment with a half time of 3.4 day@@ s. ventricular r@@ na content was elevated 26 % after 24 h of a single injection and reached a maximal level following 8 days of therap@@ y@@ . the half time for r@@ na accumulation was 2.0 day@@ s. the total content of hydroxyproline remained stable during the first 2 days of treatment but increased 46 % after 4 days of therap@@ y@@ . ventricular d@@ na content was unchanged during the early stage ( 1 @-@ 4 days ) of hypertrophic growth but increased to a new steady @-@ state level 19 % above the controls after 8 days of treat@@ ment@@ . intraventricular pressures and coronary flow measures were similar for control and experimental animals following 4 days of developed hypertroph@@ y@@ . however , d@@ p / dt in the iso @-@ treated hearts was slightly but significantly ( p less than 0.05 ) elev@@ ated@@ . these data indicate that the adaptive response to iso shows an early hypertrophic phase ( 1 @-@ 4 days ) characterized by a substantial increase in r@@ na content and cardiac mass in the absence of changes in dna@@ . however , prolonged stimulation ( 8 @-@ 12 days ) appears to represent a complex integration of both cellular hypertrophy and hyperplasia within the heart .
co @-@ carcinogenic effect of retin@@ yl acetate on fore@@ stomach carcinogenesis of male f@@ 344 rats induced with but@@ ylated hydroxy@@ anis@@ ol@@ e. the potential modifying effect of retin@@ yl acetate ( ra ) on but@@ ylated hydroxy@@ anis@@ ole ( b@@ ha ) -induced rat fore@@ stomach tumorigenesis was examin@@ ed@@ . male f@@ 344 rats , 5 weeks of age , were maintained on diet containing 1 % or 2 % b@@ ha by weight and simultaneously on drinking water supplemented with ra at various concentrations ( w / v ) for 52 week@@ s. in groups given 2 % b@@ ha , although marked hyperplastic changes of the fore@@ stomach epithelium were observed in all animals , co @-@ administration of 0.25 % ra significantly ( p less than 0.05 ) increased the incidence of fore@@ stomach tumors ( squamous cell papilloma and carcinoma ) to 60 % ( 9 / 15 , 2 rats with carcinoma ) from 15 % ( 3 / 20 , one rat with carcinoma ) in the group given ra @-@ free water@@ . in rats given 1 % b@@ ha , ra co @-@ administered at a dose of 0.05 , 0.1 , 0.2 or 0.25 % showed a dose @-@ dependent enhancing effect on the development of the b@@ ha @-@ induced epithelial hyper@@ plasi@@ a. tumors , all papillomas , were induced in 3 rats ( 17 % ) with 0.25 % ra and in one rat ( 10 % ) with 0.05 % ra co @-@ administr@@ ation@@ . ra alone did not induce hyperplastic changes in the fore@@ stom@@ ach@@ . these findings indicate that ra acted as a co @-@ carcinogen in the b@@ ha fore@@ stomach carcinogenesis of the rat .
ketanserin pretreatment reverses alfentanil @-@ induced muscle rig@@ id@@ it@@ y@@ . systemic pretreatment with ketanserin , a relatively specific type @-@ 2 serotonin receptor antagonist , significantly attenuated the muscle rigidity produced in rats by the potent short @-@ acting opiate agonist al@@ fentan@@ il@@ . following placement of subcutaneous electrodes in each animal &apos;s left gastrocnemius muscle , rigidity was assessed by analyzing root @-@ mean @-@ square electromyographic activ@@ it@@ y@@ . intraperitoneal ketanserin administration at doses of 0.63 and 2.5 mg / kg prevented the alfentanil @-@ induced increase in electromyographic activity compared with animals pretreated with sal@@ ine@@ . chlor@@ di@@ azep@@ oxide at doses up to 10 mg / kg failed to significantly influence the rigidity produced by al@@ fentan@@ il@@ . despite the absence of rigidity , animals that received ketanserin ( greater than 0.31 mg / kg i.p. ) followed by alfentanil were mo@@ tion@@ less , fl@@ acc@@ id , and less responsive to external stimuli than were animals receiving alfentanil al@@ on@@ e. rats that received ketanserin and alfentanil exhibited less rearing and exploratory behavior at the end of the 60 @-@ min recording period than did animals that received ketanserin al@@ on@@ e. these results , in combination with previous work , suggest that muscle rigidity , a clinically relevant side @-@ effect of parenteral narcotic administration , may be partly mediated via serotonergic path@@ w@@ ay@@ s. pretreatment with type @-@ 2 serotonin antagonists may be clinically useful in attenuating opiate @-@ induced rigidity , although further studies will be necessary to assess the interaction of possibly enhanced c@@ ns , cardiovascular , and respiratory depression .
glyc@@ opyr@@ ron@@ ium requirements for antagonism of the muscarinic side effects of ed@@ roph@@ oni@@ um@@ . we have compared , in 60 adult patients , the cardiovascular effects of glyc@@ opyr@@ ron@@ ium 5 micrograms kg @-@ 1 and 10 micrograms kg @-@ 1 given either simultaneously or 1 min before ed@@ roph@@ onium 1 mg kg @-@ 1@@ . significant differences between the four groups were detected ( p less than 0.001 ) . both groups receiving 10 micrograms kg @-@ 1 showed increases in heart rate of up to 30 beat min @-@ 1 ( 95 % confidence limits 28 @-@ 32 beat min @-@ 1 ) . use of glyc@@ opyr@@ ron@@ ium 5 micrograms kg @-@ 1 provided greater cardiovascular stability and , given 1 min before the ed@@ roph@@ onium , was sufficient to minimize early , ed@@ roph@@ onium @-@ induced brady@@ cardi@@ as@@ . this low dose of glyc@@ opyr@@ ron@@ ium provided good control of oropharyngeal secretions .
involvement of locus coeruleus and noradrenergic neurotransmission in fentanyl @-@ induced muscular rigidity in the rat@@ . whereas muscular rigidity is a well @-@ known side effect that is associated with high @-@ dose fentanyl anesthesia , a paucity of information exists with regard to its underlying mechanism ( s ) . we investigated in this study the possible engagement of locus coeruleus of the pons in this phenomenon , using male sp@@ rag@@ ue @-@ d@@ aw@@ ley rats anesthetized with ket@@ amin@@ e. under proper control of respiration , body temperature and end @-@ tidal co@@ 2 , intravenous administration of fentanyl ( 50 or 100 micrograms / kg ) consistently promoted an increase in electromyographic activity recorded from the gastrocnemius and abdominal rectus mus@@ cl@@ es@@ . such an induced muscular rigidity by the narcotic agent was significantly antagonized or even reduced by prior electro@@ lytic lesions of the locus coeruleus or pretreatment with the alpha @-@ adrenoceptor blocker , praz@@ osin@@ . microinjection of fentanyl ( 2.5 micrograms / 50 nl ) directly into this pontine nucleus , on the other hand , elicited discernible electromyographic excit@@ ation@@ . it is speculated that the induction of muscular rigidity by fentanyl may involve the coerul@@ ospinal noradrenergic fibers to the spinal motoneurons .
cerebral sinus thrombosis as a potential hazard of anti@@ fibrinolytic treatment in men@@ orrh@@ ag@@ i@@ a. we describe a 42 @-@ year @-@ old woman who developed superior sagittal and left transverse sinus thrombosis associated with prolonged epsilon @-@ amin@@ oc@@ apro@@ ic acid therapy for men@@ orrh@@ ag@@ i@@ a. this anti@@ fibrinolytic agent has been used in women with men@@ orrh@@ agia to promote clotting and reduce blood los@@ s. although increased risk of thromboembolic disease has been reported during treatment with epsilon @-@ amin@@ oc@@ apro@@ ic acid , cerebral sinus thrombosis has not been previously describ@@ ed@@ . careful use of epsilon @-@ amin@@ oc@@ apro@@ ic acid therapy is recommended .
hemorrhagic cystitis complicating bone marrow transpl@@ ant@@ ation@@ . hemorrhagic cystitis is a potentially serious complication of high @-@ dose cyclophosphamide therapy administered before bone marrow transpl@@ ant@@ ation@@ . as standard practice at our institution , patients who are scheduled to receive a bone marrow transplant are treated prophyl@@ acti@@ cally with forced hydration and bladder irrig@@ ation@@ . in an attempt to obvi@@ ate the in@@ convenience of bladder irrigation , we conducted a feasibility trial of uro@@ prophylaxis with mes@@ na , which neutr@@ alizes the hepatic metabolite of cyclophosphamide that causes hemorrhagic cy@@ sti@@ tis@@ . of 97 patients who received standard prophylaxis , 4 had symptomatic hemorrhagic cy@@ sti@@ tis@@ . in contrast , two of four consecutive patients who received mes@@ na uro@@ prophylaxis before allogeneic bone marrow transplantation had severe hemorrhagic cystitis for at least 2 week@@ s. because of this suboptimal result , we resumed the use of bladder irrigation and forced hydration to minimize the risk of hemorrhagic cystitis .
reversal of central benzodiazepine effects by flum@@ azenil after intravenous conscious sedation with diazepam and opioids : report of a double @-@ blind multicenter stud@@ y@@ . the flum@@ azenil in intravenous conscious sedation with diazepam multicenter study group i@@ i. the efficacy and safety of a new benzodiazepine antagonist , flum@@ azenil , were assessed in a double @-@ blind multicenter stud@@ y@@ . flum@@ azenil ( mean dose , 0.76 mg ) or placebo ( mean dose , 8.9 ml ) was administered intravenously to 130 and 67 patients , respectively , who had been given diazepam in conjunction with an opioid ( fentanyl , me@@ peridine , or morphine ) for the induction and maintenance of intravenous conscious sedation for diagnostic or therapeutic surgical proced@@ u@@ res@@ . the group assess@@ able for efficacy comprised 122 patients treated with flum@@ azenil and 64 patients given plac@@ e@@ bo@@ . after 5 minutes , 80 / 115 ( 70 % ) flum@@ azenil @-@ treated patients , compared with 21 / 63 ( 33 % ) placebo @-@ treated patients , were completely awake and alert , as indicated by a score of 5 on the observer &apos;s assessment of alertness / sedation scal@@ e. ninety @-@ five percent of patients in each group who attained a score of 5 at the 5 @-@ minute assessment showed no loss of alertness throughout the 180 @-@ minute assessment period@@ . flum@@ azenil @-@ treated patients also performed significantly better on the finger @-@ to @-@ nose test and the recall of pictures shown at the 5 @-@ minute assess@@ ment@@ . flum@@ azenil was well tolerated , with no serious adverse effects repor@@ te@@ d. thirty @-@ nine ( 30 % ) of flum@@ azenil @-@ treated patients , compared with 17 ( 25 % ) of placebo @-@ treated patients had one or more drug @-@ related adverse experi@@ enc@@ es@@ . the most common adverse effects were nausea and vomiting in the flum@@ azenil group and nausea and injection @-@ site pain in the placebo grou@@ p. flum@@ azenil was found to promptly reverse sedation induced by diazepam in the presence of opioids .
hepatic adenomas and focal nodular hyperplasia of the liver in young women on oral contraceptives : case repor@@ ts@@ . two cases of hepatic adenoma and one of focal nodular hyperplasia presumably associated with the use of oral contraceptives , are repor@@ te@@ d. special reference is made to their clinical presentation , which may be totally asym@@ ptom@@ atic@@ . liver @-@ function tests are of little diagnostic value , but valuable information may be obtained from both liver scanning and hepatic angi@@ og@@ rap@@ hy@@ . histologic differences and clinical similarities between hepatic adenoma and focal nodular hyperplasia of the liver are discussed .
arterial thromboembolism in patients receiving systemic heparin therapy : a complication associated with heparin @-@ induced thrombocyt@@ open@@ i@@ a. arterial thromboembolism is a recognized complication of systemic heparin therap@@ y@@ . characteristic of the entity is arterial occlusion by platelet @-@ fibrin thrombi with distal ischemia occurring four to twenty days after the initiation of heparin therapy , preceded by profound thrombocytopenia with platelet counts in the range of 30,000 to 40,000 per cubic millim@@ e@@ ter@@ . the clinically apparent occlusion may be preceded by gastrointestinal and musculoskeletal symptoms that appear to be ischemic in origin , and might serve to war@@ n the clinician of these complic@@ ation@@ s. previous reports of these phenomena as well as recent studies of the effect of heparin are revie@@ wed@@ . the common factor relating thromboembolism and thrombocytopenia is heparin @-@ induced platelet aggreg@@ ation@@ . appropriate treatment consists of discontinuation of heparin , and anticoagulation with sodium warfarin if necess@@ ary@@ . vascular procedures are performed as indicated .
long @-@ term prognosis for transplant @-@ free survivors of paracetamol @-@ induced acute liver fail@@ ure@@ . background : the prognosis for transplant @-@ free survivors of paracetamol @-@ induced acute liver failure remains un@@ know@@ n@@ . aim : to examine whether paracetamol @-@ induced acute liver failure increases long @-@ term mortal@@ it@@ y@@ . methods : we followed up all transplant @-@ free survivors of paracetamol @-@ induced acute liver injury , hospitalized in a d@@ anish national referral centre during 1984 @-@ 200@@ 4@@ . we compared age @-@ specific mortality rates from 1 year post @-@ discharge through 2008 between those in whom the liver injury led to an acute liver failure and those in whom it did not@@ . results : we included 6@@ 41 patient@@ s. on average , age @-@ specific mortality rates were slightly higher for the 101 patients whose paracetamol @-@ induced liver injury had caused an acute liver failure ( adjusted mortality rate ratio = 1.70 , 95 % ci 1.02 @-@ 2.@@ 85 ) , but the association was age @-@ dependent , and no survivors of acute liver failure died of liver disease , whereas suicides were frequent in both grou@@ ps@@ . these observations speak against long @-@ term effects of acute liver fail@@ ure@@ . more likely , the elevated mortality rate ratio resulted from incomplete adjustment for the greater prevalence of substance abuse among survivors of acute liver fail@@ ure@@ . conclusions : paracetamol @-@ induced acute liver failure did not affect long @-@ term mortal@@ it@@ y@@ . clinical follow @-@ up may be justified by the cause of the liver failure , but not by the liver failure itself .
serotonin 6 receptor gene is associated with methamphetamine @-@ induced psychosis in a j@@ ap@@ anese popul@@ ation@@ . background : altered serotonergic neural transmission is hypothesized to be a susceptibility factor for psychotic disorders such as schizophren@@ i@@ a. the serotonin 6 ( 5 @-@ ht@@ 6 ) receptor is therapeutically targeted by several second generation antipsychotics , such as clozapine and olanzapine , and d @-@ amphetamine @-@ induced hyperactivity in rats is corrected with the use of a selective 5 @-@ ht@@ 6 receptor antagon@@ ist@@ . in addition , the disrupted pre@@ pulse inhibition induced by d @-@ amphetamine or ph@@ encyclidine was restored by 5 @-@ ht@@ 6 receptor antagonist in an animal study using rat@@ s. these animal models were considered to reflect the positive symptoms of schizophrenia , and the above evidence suggests that altered 5 @-@ ht@@ 6 receptors are involved in the pathophysiology of psychotic dis@@ or@@ der@@ s. the symptoms of methamphetamine ( meth ) -induced psychosis are similar to those of paranoid type schizophren@@ i@@ a. therefore , we conducted an analysis of the association of the 5 @-@ ht@@ 6 gene ( h@@ tr@@ 6 ) with meth @-@ induced psych@@ osi@@ s. method : using five tagging sn@@ ps ( rs@@ 66@@ 93@@ 503 , rs@@ 180@@ 50@@ 54 , rs@@ 49@@ 12@@ 138 , rs@@ 37@@ 90@@ 7@@ 57 and rs@@ 9@@ 65@@ 99@@ 97 ) , we conducted a genetic association analysis of case @-@ control samples ( 197 meth @-@ induced psychosis patients and 337 controls ) in the j@@ ap@@ anese popul@@ ation@@ . the age and sex of the control subjects did not differ from those of the methamphetamine dependence patient@@ s. results : rs@@ 66@@ 93@@ 503 was associated with meth @-@ induced psychosis patients in the allele / genotype @-@ wise analy@@ si@@ s. moreover , this association remained significant after bon@@ fer@@ roni correc@@ tion@@ . in the haplotype @-@ wise analysis , we detected an association between two markers ( rs@@ 66@@ 93@@ 503 and rs@@ 180@@ 50@@ 54 ) and three markers ( rs@@ 66@@ 93@@ 503 , rs@@ 180@@ 50@@ 54 and rs@@ 49@@ 12@@ 138 ) in h@@ tr@@ 6 and meth @-@ induced psychosis patients , respec@@ ti@@ vel@@ y@@ . conclusion : h@@ tr@@ 6 may play an important role in the pathophysiology of meth @-@ induced psychosis in the j@@ ap@@ anese population .

p@@ em@@ oline induced acute chore@@ o@@ ath@@ et@@ osis : case report and review of the liter@@ at@@ ure@@ . background : p@@ em@@ oline is an oxazol@@ idine derivative that is structurally different from amph@@ et@@ amines and used in the treatment of attention deficit dis@@ or@@ der@@ . p@@ em@@ oline has not been commonly associated in the literature as a cause of acute movement dis@@ or@@ der@@ s. the following case describes two children acutely pois@@ oned with p@@ em@@ oline who experienced profound chore@@ o@@ ath@@ et@@ osi@@ s. case report : two , 3 @-@ year @-@ old male , identical twin siblings presented to the emergency department after found playing with a an empty bottle of p@@ em@@ oline originally containing 59 t@@ abl@@ et@@ s. the children had a medical history significant for attention deficit disorder previously treated with methylphenidate without success@@ . this was their first day of p@@ em@@ oline therap@@ y@@ . the chore@@ o@@ ath@@ et@@ oid movements began 45 min to 1 h after ing@@ estion@@ . the children gave no history of prior movement disorders and there was no family history of movement dis@@ or@@ der@@ s. the children received gastrointestinal decontamination and high doses of intravenous benzodiazepines in an attempt to control the chore@@ o@@ ath@@ et@@ oid mo@@ v@@ ement@@ s. despite treatment , the children continued to have chore@@ o@@ ath@@ et@@ osis for approximately 24 hour@@ s. forty @-@ eight hours after admission , the children appeared to be at their baseline and were discharged home@@ . conclusion : p@@ em@@ oline associated movement disorder has been rarely reported in the acute toxicology liter@@ at@@ ure@@ . the possibility of chore@@ o@@ ath@@ et@@ oid movements should be considered in patients presenting after p@@ em@@ oline overdose .
continuous subcutaneous administration of mes@@ na to prevent ifosfamide @-@ induced hemorrhagic cy@@ sti@@ tis@@ . hemorrhagic cystitis is a major potential toxicity of ifosfamide that can be prevented by administering mes@@ na along with the cytotoxic ag@@ ent@@ . mes@@ na is generally administered by the intravenous route , although experience with oral delivery of the drug has incre@@ as@@ ed@@ . the continuous subcutaneous administration of mes@@ na has the advantage of not requiring intravenous access@@ . in addition , subcutaneous delivery of the neutralizing agent will not be associated with the risk of inadequate urinary mes@@ na concentrations , such as in a patient taking oral mes@@ na who experiences severe ifosfamide @-@ induced emesis and is unable to absorb the dru@@ g. limited clinical experience with continuous subcutaneous mes@@ na administration suggests it is a safe , practical , and economic method of drug delivery that permits ifosfamide to be administered successfully in the outpatient setting .

risk of nephropathy after consumption of nonionic contrast media by children undergoing cardiac angiography : a prospective stud@@ y@@ . despite increasing reports on nonionic contrast media @-@ induced nephropathy ( cin ) in hospitalized adult patients during cardiac procedures , the studies in pediatrics are limited , with even less focus on possible predisposing factors and preventive measures for patients undergoing cardiac angi@@ og@@ rap@@ hy@@ . this prospective study determined the incidence of cin for two nonionic contrast media ( cm ) , i@@ opro@@ m@@ ide and i@@ ohex@@ ol , among 80 patients younger than 18 years and compared the rates for this complication in relation to the type and dosage of cm and the presence of cyan@@ osi@@ s. the 80 patients in the study consecutively received either i@@ opro@@ m@@ ide ( group a , n = 40 ) or i@@ ohex@@ ol ( group b , n = 40 ) . serum sodium ( na ) , potassium ( k ) , and creatinine ( cr ) were measured 24 h before angiography as baseline values , then measured again at 12- , 24@@ - , and 48 @-@ h intervals after cm use@@ . urine samples for na and cr also were checked at the same inter@@ val@@ s. risk of renal failure , injury to the kidney , failure of kidney function , loss of kidney function , and end @-@ stage renal damage ( rif@@ le criteria ) were used to define cin and its incidence in the study popul@@ ation@@ . accordingly , among the 15 cin patients ( 18.@@ 75 % ) , 7.5 % of the patients in group a had increased risk and 3.75 % had renal injury , whereas 5 % of group b had increased risk and 2.5 % had renal injur@@ y@@ . whereas 33.3 % of the patients with cin were among those who received the proper dosage of cm , the percentage increased to 66.6 % among those who received larger doses , with a significant difference in the incidence of cin related to the different dosages of cm ( p = 0.014 ) . among the 15 patients with cin , 6 had cyan@@ otic congenital heart diseases , but the incidence did not differ significantly from that for the non@@ cyan@@ otic patients ( p = 0.2@@ 43 ) . although clinically silent , cin is not rare in pediatr@@ ic@@ s. the incidence depends on dosage but not on the type of consumed nonionic cm , nor on the presence of cyan@@ osis , and although cin usually is reversible , more concern is needed for the prevention of such a complication in children .
a case of ventricular tachycardia related to caffeine pre@@ treat@@ ment@@ . suboptimal seizure duration is commonly encountered in electroconvulsive therapy practice , especially in older patients with higher seizure thresh@@ ol@@ ds@@ . intravenous caffeine is commonly used to improve seizure duration and quality in such patients and is generally well tolerated asi@@ de from occasional reports of relatively benign ventricular ectop@@ y@@ . we describe a patient with no previous history of cardiac disease or arrhythmia who developed sustained big@@ emin@@ y and 2 brief runs of ventricular tachycardia after caffeine administr@@ ation@@ . although intravenous caffeine is generally well tolerated , the clinician should be aware of the potential for unpredictable and serious ventricular arrhythmias .
optical coherence tomography can measure axonal loss in patients with eth@@ am@@ but@@ ol @-@ induced optic neuro@@ path@@ y@@ . purpose : to map and identify the pattern , in vivo , of axonal degeneration in eth@@ am@@ but@@ ol @-@ induced optic neuropathy using optical coherence tomography ( oc@@ t ) . eth@@ am@@ but@@ ol is an antimyco@@ bacterial agent often used to treat tubercul@@ osi@@ s. a serious complication of eth@@ am@@ but@@ ol is an optic neuropathy that impairs visual acuity , contrast sensitivity , and color vi@@ sion@@ . however , early on , when the toxic optic neuropathy is mild and partly reversible , the fund@@ us@@ copic findings are often subtle and easy to mis@@ s. methods : three subjects with a history of eth@@ am@@ but@@ ol ( em@@ b ) -induced optic neuropathy of short- , intermedi@@ ate- , and long @-@ term visual deficits were administered a full neuro @-@ ophthalmologic examination including visual acuity , color vision , contrast sensitivity , and fundus examin@@ ation@@ . in addition , oc@@ t ( oc@@ t 3000 , hum@@ ph@@ re@@ y @-@ ze@@ iss , du@@ bl@@ in , ca ) was performed on both eyes of each subject using the retinal nerve fiber layer ( r@@ n@@ fl ) analysis protoc@@ ol@@ . oc@@ t interpol@@ ates data from 100 points around the optic nerve to effectively map out the r@@ n@@ fl@@ . results : the results were compared to the calculated average r@@ n@@ fl of normal eyes accumulated from four prior studies using oc@@ t , n = 66@@ 1@@ . in all subjects with history of em@@ b @-@ induced optic neuropathy , there was a mean loss of 72 % nerve fiber layer thickness in the temporal quadrant ( patient a , with eventual recovery of visual acuity and fields , 58 % loss ; patient b , with intermediate visual deficits , 68 % loss ; patient c , with chronic visual deficits , 90 % loss ) , with an average mean optic nerve thickness of 26 + / -@@ 16 microm@@ . there was a combined mean loss of 46 % of fibers from the superior , inferior , and nasal quadrants in the ( six ) eyes of all three subjects ( mean average thickness of 55 + / -@@ 29 microm ) . in both sets ( four ) of eyes of the subjects with persistent visual deficits ( patients b and c ) , there was an average loss of 79 % of nerve fiber thickness in the temporal quadr@@ ant@@ . conclusions : the oc@@ t results in these patients with em@@ b @-@ induced optic neuropathy show considerable loss especially of the temporal fiber@@ s. this is consistent with prior histopathological studies that show predominant loss of parv@@ o @-@ cellular axons ( or small @-@ caliber axons ) within the papill@@ o @-@ macular bundle in toxic or hereditary optic neuro@@ path@@ i@@ es@@ . oc@@ t can be a valuable tool in the quantitative analysis of optic neuro@@ path@@ i@@ es@@ . additionally , in terms of management of em@@ b @-@ induced optic neuropathy , it is important to properly manage eth@@ am@@ but@@ ol dosing in patients with renal impairment and to achieve proper transition to a maintenance dose once an appropriate loading dose has been reached .
effects of the cyclooxygenase @-@ 2 specific inhibitor val@@ dec@@ oxib versus nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents and placebo on cardiovascular thrombotic events in patients with arth@@ ri@@ tis@@ . there have been concerns that the risk of cardiovascular thrombotic events may be higher with cyclooxygenase ( co@@ x ) -2 @-@ specific inhibitors than nonselective nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs ( n@@ sa@@ ids ) . we evaluated cardiovascular event data for val@@ dec@@ oxib , a new co@@ x @-@ 2 @-@ specific inhibitor in approximately 8000 patients with osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis treated with this agent in randomized clinical tri@@ al@@ s. the incidence of cardiovascular thrombotic events ( cardiac , cerebrovascular and peripheral vascular , or arterial thrombotic ) was determined by analyzing pooled val@@ dec@@ oxib ( 10 @-@ 80 mg daily ) , nonselective n@@ said ( diclofenac 75 mg bid , ibuprofen 800 mg tid , or naproxen 500 mg bid ) and placebo data from 10 randomized osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis trials that were 6 @-@ 52 weeks in dur@@ ation@@ . the incidence rates of events were determined in all patients ( n = 79@@ 34 ) and in users of low @-@ dose ( &lt; or = 325 mg daily ) aspirin ( n = 10@@ 51 ) and nonusers of aspirin ( n = 68@@ 83 ) . crude and exposure @-@ adjusted incidences of thrombotic events were similar for val@@ dec@@ oxib , n@@ sa@@ ids , and plac@@ e@@ bo@@ . the risk of serious thrombotic events was also similar for each val@@ dec@@ oxib dos@@ e. thrombotic risk was consistently higher for users of aspirin users than nonusers of aspirin ( placebo , 1.4 % vs. 0 % ; val@@ dec@@ oxib , 1.7 % vs. 0.2 % ; n@@ sa@@ ids , 1.9 % vs. 0.5 % ) . the rates of events in users of aspirin were similar for all 3 treatment groups and across val@@ dec@@ oxib dos@@ es@@ . short- and intermediate @-@ term treatment with therapeutic ( 10 or 20 mg daily ) and supra@@ therapeutic ( 40 or 80 mg daily ) val@@ dec@@ oxib doses was not associated with an increased incidence of thrombotic events relative to nonselective n@@ sa@@ ids or placebo in osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis patients in controlled clinical trials .

glutamatergic neurotransmission mediated by nm@@ da receptors in the inferior colliculus can modulate haloperidol @-@ induced catal@@ ep@@ sy@@ . the inferior colliculus ( ic ) is primarily involved in the processing of auditory information , but it is distinguished from other auditory nuclei in the brainstem by its connections with structures of the motor system@@ . functional evidence relating the ic to motor behavior derives from experiments showing that activation of the ic by electrical stimulation or excitatory amino acid microinjection causes freezing , escape @-@ like behavior , and immobil@@ it@@ y@@ . however , the nature of this immobility is still un@@ cl@@ ear@@ . the present study examined the influence of excitatory amino acid @-@ mediated mechanisms in the ic on the catal@@ epsy induced by the dopamine receptor blocker haloperidol administered systemically ( 1 or 0.5 mg / kg ) in rat@@ s. haloperidol @-@ induced catal@@ epsy was challenged with prior intrac@@ oll@@ icular micro@@ injections of glutamate nm@@ da receptor antagonists , m@@ k @-@ 801 ( 15 or 30 mmol / 0.5 microl ) and ap@@ 7 ( 10 or 20 nmol / 0.5 microl ) , or of the nm@@ da receptor agonist n @-@ methyl @-@ d @-@ aspartate ( nm@@ da , 20 or 30 nmol / 0.5 microl ) . the results showed that intrac@@ oll@@ icular microinjection of m@@ k @-@ 801 and ap@@ 7 previous to systemic injections of haloperidol significantly attenuated the catal@@ epsy , as indicated by a reduced latency to step down from a horizontal bar@@ . accordingly , intrac@@ oll@@ icular microinjection of nm@@ da increased the latency to step down the bar@@ . these findings suggest that glutamate @-@ mediated mechanisms in the neural circuits at the ic level influence haloperidol @-@ induced catal@@ epsy and participate in the regulation of motor activity .
metabotropic glutamate 7 receptor subtype modulates motor symptoms in rodent models of parkin@@ son &apos;s dise@@ as@@ e. metabotropic glutamate ( m@@ gl@@ u ) receptors modulate synaptic transmission in the central nervous system and represent promising therapeutic targets for symptomatic treatment of parkin@@ son &apos;s disease ( p@@ d ) . among the eight m@@ gl@@ u receptor subtypes , m@@ glu@@ 7 receptor is prominently expressed in the basal ganglia , but its role in restoring motor function in animal models of p@@ d is not know@@ n@@ . the effects of n , n &apos; -di@@ benz@@ hydr@@ y@@ leth@@ ane @-@ 1,2 @-@ diamine dihydro@@ chloride ( am@@ n@@ 0@@ 82 ) , the first selective allosteric activator of m@@ glu@@ 7 receptors , were thus tested in different rodent models of p@@ d. here , we show that oral ( 5 mg / kg ) or intra@@ striatal administration ( 0.1 and 0.5 nmol ) of am@@ n@@ 0@@ 82 reverses haloperidol @-@ induced catal@@ epsy in rat@@ s. am@@ n@@ 0@@ 82 ( 2.5 and 5 mg / kg ) reduces apomorphine @-@ induced rotations in unilateral 6 @-@ hydroxydopamine ( 6 @-@ oh@@ da ) -@@ lesioned rat@@ s. in a more complex task commonly used to evaluate major a@@ kinetic symptoms of p@@ d patients , 5 mg / kg am@@ n@@ 0@@ 82 reverses the increased reaction time to respond to a cue of bilateral 6 @-@ oh@@ da @-@ lesioned rat@@ s. in addition , am@@ n@@ 0@@ 82 reduces the duration of haloperidol @-@ induced catal@@ epsy in a m@@ glu@@ 7 receptor @-@ dependent manner in wild @-@ type but not m@@ glu@@ 7 receptor knockout mic@@ e. higher doses of am@@ n@@ 0@@ 82 ( 10 and 20 mg / kg p.o. ) have no effect on the same models of p@@ d. overall these findings suggest that m@@ glu@@ 7 receptor activation can reverse motor dysfunction associated with reduced dopamine activ@@ it@@ y@@ . selective ligands of m@@ glu@@ 7 receptor subtypes may thus be considered as promising compounds for the development of anti@@ parkinsonian therapeutic strategies .
nimodipine prevents memory impairment caused by nitroglycerin @-@ induced hypotension in adult mic@@ e. background : hypotension and a resultant decrease in cerebral blood flow have been implicated in the development of cognitive dys@@ function@@ . we tested the hypothesis that nimodipine ( nim@@ o ) administered at the onset of nitroglycerin ( nt@@ g ) -induced hypotension would preserve long @-@ term associative mem@@ or@@ y@@ . methods : the passive avoidance ( pa ) paradigm was used to assess memory ret@@ enti@@ on@@ . for pa training , latencies ( seconds ) were recorded for entry from a suspended platform into a plex@@ ig@@ l@@ as tube where a shock was automatically deli@@ ve@@ red@@ . latencies were recorded 48 h later for a testing tri@@ al@@ . ninety @-@ six sw@@ iss @-@ web@@ ster mice ( 30 @-@ 35 g , 6 @-@ 8 wk ) , were randomized into 6 groups 1 ) saline ( control ) , 2 ) nt@@ g immediately after learning , 3 ) nt@@ g 3 h after learning , 4 ) nt@@ g and nim@@ o , 5 ) vehicle , and 6 ) nim@@ o al@@ on@@ e. the extent of hypotension and changes in brain tissue oxygenation ( p@@ b@@ to ( 2 ) ) and in cerebral blood flow were studied in a separate group of anim@@ al@@ s. results : all groups exhibited similar training latencies ( 17.0 + / - 4.6 s ) . mice subjected to hypotensive episodes showed a significant decrease in latency time ( 178 + / - 156 s ) compared with those injected with saline , nt@@ g + nim@@ o , or delayed nt@@ g ( 580 + / - 81 s , 5@@ 57 + / - 67 s , and 4@@ 93 + / - 146 s , respectively ) . a kr@@ us@@ kal @-@ w@@ all@@ is 1 @-@ way analysis of variance indicated a significant difference among the 4 treatment groups ( h = 15.@@ 34 ; p &lt; 0.001 ) . in a separate group of mice not subjected to behavioral studies , the same dose of nt@@ g ( n = 3 ) and nt@@ g + nim@@ o ( n = 3 ) caused mean arterial blood pressure to decrease from 8@@ 5.9 + / - 3.8 mm h@@ g se@@ m to 31.6 + / - 0.8 mm h@@ g se@@ m and from 8@@ 6.2 + / - 3.7 mm h@@ g se@@ m to 32.6 + / - 0.2 mm h@@ g se@@ m , respec@@ ti@@ vel@@ y@@ . mean arterial blood pressure in mice treated with nim@@ o alone decreased from 8@@ 8.1 + / - 3.8 mm h@@ g to 80.0 + / - 2.9 mm h@@ g. the intergroup difference was statistically significant ( p &lt; 0.05 ) . p@@ b@@ to ( 2 ) decreased from 5@@ 1.7 + / - 4.5 mm h@@ g se@@ m to 33.8 + / - 5.2 mm h@@ g se@@ m in the nt@@ g group and from 38.6 + / - 6.1 mm h@@ g se@@ m to 25.4 + / - 2.0 mm h@@ g se@@ m in the nt@@ g + nim@@ o groups , respec@@ ti@@ vel@@ y@@ . there were no significant differences among grou@@ ps@@ . conclusion : in a pa retention paradigm , the injection of nt@@ g immediately after learning produced a significant impairment of long @-@ term associative memory in mice , whereas delayed induced hypotension had no effec@@ t. nim@@ o attenuated the disruption in consolidation of long @-@ term memory caused by nt@@ g but did not improve latency in the absence of hypot@@ en@@ sion@@ . the observed effect of nim@@ o may have been attributable to the preservation of calcium homeostasis during hypotension , because there were no differences in the p@@ b@@ to ( 2 ) indices among groups .

beta @-@ 2 @-@ adrenoceptor @-@ mediated hypokalemia and its abol@@ ishment by ox@@ pren@@ ol@@ ol@@ . the time course and concentration @-@ effect relationship of terbutaline @-@ induced hypokalemia was studied , using computer @-@ aided pharmacokinetic @-@ dynamic mod@@ el@@ ing@@ . subsequently we investigated the efficacy of ox@@ pren@@ olol in antagon@@ izing such hypokalemia , together with the pharmacokinetic interaction between both dru@@ g@@ s. six healthy subjects were given a 0.5 mg subcutaneous dose of terbutaline on two occasions : 1 hour after oral administration of a placebo and 1 hour after 80 mg ox@@ pren@@ olol or@@ all@@ y@@ . in the 7 @-@ hour period after terbutaline administration , plasma samples were taken for determination of plasma potassium levels and drug concentr@@ ation@@ s. the sigmoid em@@ ax model offered a good description of the relation between terbutaline concentrations and potassium effec@@ ts@@ . ox@@ pren@@ olol caused decreases of 65 % and 56 % of terbutaline volume of distribution and clearance , respectively , and an increase of 130 % of its auc@@ . in spite of higher terbutaline concentrations after ox@@ pren@@ olol pretreatment , the hypokalemia was almost completely antagonized by the beta 2 @-@ blocking action .
midline b@@ 3 serotonin nerves in rat medulla are involved in hypotensive effect of methyl@@ dop@@ a. previous experiments in this laboratory have shown that microinjection of methyl@@ dopa onto the ventrolateral cells of the b@@ 3 serotonin neurons in the medulla elicits a hypotensive response mediated by a projection descending into the spinal cord@@ . the present experiments were designed to investigate the role of the midline cells of the b@@ 3 serotonin neurons in the medulla , coincid@@ ing with the raphe magn@@ us@@ . in spontaneously hypertensive , stroke @-@ prone rats , microinjection of methyl@@ dopa into the area of the midline b@@ 3 serotonin cell group in the ventral medulla caused a potent hypotension of 30 @-@ 40 mm h@@ g , which was maximal 2 @-@ 3 h after administration and was abolished by the serotonin neurotoxin 5,7 @-@ dihydroxy@@ tryptamine ( 5,7 @-@ dh@@ t ) injected intracerebro@@ ventricul@@ ar@@ ly@@ . however , intr@@ aspinal injection of 5,7 @-@ dh@@ t to produce a more selective lesion of only descending serotonin projections in the spinal cord did not affect this hypot@@ en@@ sion@@ . further , 5,7 @-@ dh@@ t lesion of serotonin nerves travel@@ ling in the median forebrain bundle , one of the main ascending pathways from the b@@ 3 serotonin cells , did not affect the fall in blood pressure associated with a midline b@@ 3 serotonin methyl@@ dopa injec@@ tion@@ . it is concluded therefore that , unlike the ventrolateral b@@ 3 cells which mediate a methyl@@ dopa @-@ induced hypotension via descending projections , the midline serotonin b@@ 3 cells in the medulla contribute to the hypotensive action of methyl@@ dopa , either by way of an ascending projection which does not pass through the median forebrain bundle , or through a projection restricted to the caudal brainstem .
yohimbine treatment of sexual side effects induced by serotonin reuptake bloc@@ ker@@ s. background : preclinical and clinical studies suggest that yohimbine facilitates sexual behavior and may be helpful in the treatment of male im@@ pot@@ enc@@ e. a single case report suggests that yohimbine may be used to treat the sexual side effects of clomi@@ pr@@ amin@@ e. this study evaluated yohimbine as a treatment for the sexual side effects caused by serotonin reuptake bloc@@ ker@@ s. method : six patients with either obsessive compulsive disorder , tricho@@ till@@ om@@ ania , anxiety , or affective disorders who suffered sexual side effects after treatment with serotonin reuptake blockers were given yohimbine on a p.@@ r.@@ n@@ . basis in an open clinical tri@@ al@@ . various doses of yohimbine were used to determine the ideal dose for each patient@@ . results : five of the six patients experienced improved sexual functioning after taking yo@@ him@@ bin@@ e. one patient who failed to comply with yohimbine treatment had no therapeutic effec@@ ts@@ . side effects of yohimbine included excessive sweating , increased anxiety , and a wound @-@ up feeling in some patient@@ s. conclusion : the results of this study indicate that yohimbine may be an effective treatment for the sexual side effects caused by serotonin reuptake bloc@@ ker@@ s. future controlled studies are needed to further investigate the effectiveness and safety of yohimbine for this indication .
hypersensitivity immune reaction as a mechanism for di@@ lev@@ alol @-@ associated hepati@@ tis@@ . objective : to assess lymphocyte reactivity to di@@ lev@@ alol and to serum containing putative ex vivo di@@ lev@@ alol antigens or metabolites in a case of di@@ lev@@ alol @-@ induced liver injur@@ y@@ . patient : a 58 @-@ year @-@ old woman with a clinical diagnosis of di@@ lev@@ alol @-@ induced liver injur@@ y@@ . methods : peripheral blood mononuclear cells collected from the patient were cultured in the presence of a solution of di@@ lev@@ alol and also with sera collected from a volunteer before and after di@@ lev@@ alol in@@ ta@@ ke@@ . a similar protocol was performed with lymphocytes from a healthy subjec@@ t. results : no lymphocyte proliferation was observed either in the patient or in the healthy volunteer in the presence of di@@ lev@@ alol solu@@ tion@@ s. a significant proliferative response to serum collected after di@@ lev@@ alol intake was observed in the case of the patient compared with the proliferative response to the serum collected before the drug in@@ ta@@ ke@@ . no reactivity was found when lymphocytes from the healthy subject were tested under similar condi@@ tion@@ s. conclusions : the methodology used allowed the detection of lymphocyte sensitization to sera containing ex vivo @-@ prepared di@@ lev@@ alol antigens , suggesting the involvement of an immunologic mechanism in di@@ lev@@ alol @-@ induced liver injury .
reversible myocardial hypertrophy induced by tacrolimus in a pediatric heart transplant recipient : case repor@@ t. tacrolimus is a potent immunosuppressant that is frequently used in organ transpl@@ ant@@ ation@@ . however , adverse effects include cardiac toxic@@ it@@ y@@ . herein we describe transient myocardial hypertrophy induced by tacrolimus after heart transpl@@ ant@@ ation@@ . the hypertrophy caused no clinical symptoms but was noted because of elevation of plasma brain natriuretic peptide concentration and confirmed at echocardi@@ og@@ rap@@ hy@@ . initially , allograft rejection was fea@@ red ; however , myocardial biopsy samples revealed only interstitial edema and mild myocardial hypertrophy ; neither cellular nor humoral rejection was detec@@ te@@ d. the blood tacrolimus concentration was higher than usual at that time ; thus , tacrolimus dosage was reduc@@ ed@@ . myocardial hypertrophy completely resolved upon reducing the target concentration of tacrolimus and did not recur , as confirmed at echocardiography and myocardial biop@@ sy@@ . thus , we conclude that tacrolimus induces reversible myocardial hypertroph@@ y@@ . in patients receiving tacrolimus therapy , blood concentration should be carefully controlled and extreme attention paid to cardiac involvement .
comparison of unilateral pall@@ id@@ otomy and sub@@ thalam@@ otomy findings in advanced idiopathic parkin@@ son &apos;s dise@@ as@@ e. a prospective , randomized , double @-@ blind pilot study to compare the results of stereotactic unilateral pall@@ id@@ otomy and sub@@ thalam@@ otomy in advanced idiopathic parkin@@ son &apos;s disease ( p@@ d ) refractory to medical treatment was de@@ sig@@ ne@@ d. ten consecutive patients ( mean age , 5@@ 8.4 + / - 6.8 years ; 7 men , 3 women ) with similar characteristics at the duration of disease ( mean disease time , 8.4 + / - 3.5 years ) , disabling motor fluctuations ( ho@@ e@@ hn _ y@@ a@@ hr stage 3 @-@ 5 in off @-@ drug phases ) and levodopa @-@ induced dys@@ kine@@ sias were selec@@ te@@ d. all patients had bilateral symptoms and their levodopa equivalent dosing were analy@@ sed@@ . six patients were operated on in the globus pallidus intern@@ a ( gp@@ i ) and four in the subthalamic nucleus ( st@@ n ) . clinical evaluation included the use of the unified parkin@@ son &apos;s disease rating scale ( up@@ dr@@ s ) , ho@@ e@@ hn _ y@@ a@@ hr score and sch@@ wa@@ b en@@ gland activities of daily living ( ad@@ l ) score in &apos; on &apos; - and &apos; off &apos; -@@ drug conditions before surgery and 6 months after surg@@ ery@@ . there was statistically significant improvement in all contralateral major parkinsonian motor signs in all patients followed for 6 mon@@ th@@ s. levodopa equivalent daily intake was significantly reduced in the st@@ n grou@@ p. changes in up@@ dr@@ s , ho@@ e@@ hn _ y@@ a@@ hr and sch@@ wa@@ b en@@ gland ad@@ l scores were similar in both grou@@ ps@@ . cognitive functions were unchanged in both grou@@ ps@@ . complications were observed in two patients : one had a left hom@@ onymous hemi@@ an@@ op@@ sia after pall@@ id@@ otomy and another one developed left hem@@ ib@@ all@@ istic movements 3 days after sub@@ thalam@@ otomy which partly improved within 1 month with valproate 1000 mg / day@@ . the findings of this study suggest that lesions of the unilateral st@@ n and gp@@ i are equally effective treatment for patients with advanced p@@ d refractory to medical treatment .
protective effects of antithrombin on puromycin amin@@ onucle@@ oside neph@@ rosis in rat@@ s. we investigated the effects of antithrombin , a plasma inhibitor of coagulation factors , in rats with puromycin amin@@ onucle@@ oside @-@ induced neph@@ rosis , which is an experimental model of human nephrotic syn@@ dro@@ me@@ . antithrombin ( 50 or 500 i@@ u / kg / i.v. ) was administered to rats once a day for 10 days immediately after the injection of puromycin amin@@ onucle@@ oside ( 50 mg / kg / i.v. ) . treatment with antithrombin attenuated the puromycin amin@@ onucle@@ oside @-@ induced hematological abnormal@@ iti@@ es@@ . puromycin amin@@ onucle@@ oside @-@ induced renal dysfunction and hyperlipidemia were also sup@@ pres@@ sed@@ . histopathological examination revealed severe renal damage such as protein@@ aceous casts in tubul@@ i and tubular expansion in the kidney of control rats , while an improvement of the damage was seen in antithrombin @-@ treated rat@@ s. in addition , antithrombin treatment markedly suppressed puromycin amin@@ onucle@@ oside @-@ induced apoptosis of renal tubular epithelial cell@@ s. furthermore , puromycin amin@@ onucle@@ oside @-@ induced increases in renal cytokine content were also decre@@ as@@ ed@@ . these findings suggest that thrombin plays an important role in the pathogenesis of puromycin amin@@ onucle@@ oside @-@ induced nephrotic syn@@ dro@@ me@@ . treatment with antithrombin may be clinically effective in patients with nephrotic syndrome .
reverse or inverted left ventricular apical ballo@@ oning syndrome ( reverse ta@@ k@@ ot@@ sub@@ o cardiomyopathy ) in a young woman in the setting of amphetamine use@@ . transient left ventricular apical ballo@@ oning syndrome was first described in j@@ ap@@ an as &quot; ta@@ k@@ ot@@ sub@@ o cardiomyopathy . &quot; this syndrome has been identified in many other coun@@ tri@@ es@@ . many variations of this syndrome have been recently described in the liter@@ at@@ ure@@ . one of the ra@@ rest is the reverse type of this syndrome , with hyper@@ dynamic apex and complete a@@ kinesia of the base ( as opposed to the classic apical ballo@@ oning ) . in this article , we report an interesting case of a young woman who presented with this rare type of reverse apical ballo@@ oning syndrome occurring after amphetamine use@@ . this report is followed by review of the literature .
attenuated disruption of pre@@ pulse inhibition by dopaminergic stimulation after maternal deprivation and adolescent corticosterone treatment in rat@@ s. the development of schizophrenia may include an early neurodevelopmental stress component which increases vulnerability to later stressful life events , in combination leading to overt dise@@ as@@ e. we investigated the effect of an early stress , in the form of maternal deprivation , combined with a later stress , simulated by chronic peri@@ adolescent corticosterone treatment , on behaviour in rat@@ s. acute treatment with apomorphine caused disruption of pre@@ pulse inhibition ( pp@@ i ) in controls and in rats that had undergone either maternal deprivation or corticosterone treatment , but was surprisingly absent in rats that had undergone the combined early and late stress@@ . amphetamine treatment significantly disrupted pp@@ i in both non @-@ deprived groups , but was absent in both maternally deprived grou@@ ps@@ . the serotonin @-@ 1a receptor agonist , 8 @-@ o@@ h @-@ d@@ p@@ at , induced a significant disruption of pp@@ i in all grou@@ ps@@ . amphetamine @-@ induced locomotor hyperactivity was similar in all grou@@ ps@@ . these results show an inhibitory interaction of early stress , caused by maternal deprivation , combined with &apos; adolescent &apos; stress , simulated by corticosterone treatment , on dopaminergic regulation of p@@ pi@@ . the altered effects of apomorphine and amphetamine could indicate differential changes in dopamine receptor signalling leading to functional desensi@@ tisation , or altered modulation of sensory gating in the nucleus accumbens by limbic structures such as the hippocampus .
peripheral iron dextran induced degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in rat substantia nig@@ ra@@ . iron accumulation is considered to be involved in the pathogenesis of parkin@@ son &apos;s dise@@ as@@ e. to demonstrate the relationship between peripheral iron overload and dopaminergic neuron loss in rat substantia nigra ( sn ) , in the present study we used fast cyclic voltammetry , tyrosine hydroxylase ( th ) immunohistochemistry , per@@ ls &apos; iron staining , and high performance liquid chromatography @-@ electrochemical detection to study the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons and increased iron content in the sn of iron dextran over@@ loaded anim@@ al@@ s. the findings showed that peripheral iron dextran overload increased the iron staining positive cells and reduced the number of th @-@ immunoreactive neurons in the sn@@ . as a result , dopamine release and content , as well as its metabolites contents were decreased in caudate put@@ am@@ en@@ . even more dramatic changes were found in chronic overload grou@@ p. these results suggest that peripheral iron dextran can increase the iron level in the sn , where excessive iron causes the degeneration of dopaminergic neuron@@ s. the chronic iron overload may be more destructive to dopaminergic neurons than the acute iron overload .
warfarin @-@ induced leuk@@ ocyt@@ oc@@ lastic vascul@@ iti@@ s. skin reactions associated with oral coumarin @-@ derived anticoagulants are an uncommon occur@@ ren@@ c@@ e. leuk@@ ocyt@@ oc@@ lastic vasculitis ( l@@ v ) is primarily a cutaneous small vessel vasculitis , though systemic involvement may be encoun@@ te@@ red@@ . we report 4 patients with late @-@ onset l@@ v probably due to war@@ far@@ in@@ . all 4 patients presented with skin erup@@ tions that developed after receiving warfarin for several year@@ s. the results of skin lesion biopsies were available in 3 patients , confirming l@@ v cutaneous lesions resolved in all patients after warfarin was discontinu@@ ed@@ . in 2 of the 4 patients , re@@ challenge with warfarin led to recurrence of the le@@ sion@@ s. l@@ v may be a late @-@ onset adverse reaction associated with warfarin therapy .
the activation of spinal n @-@ methyl @-@ d @-@ aspartate receptors may contribute to degeneration of spinal motor neurons induced by neur@@ axial morphine after a non@@ injurious interval of spinal cord ischem@@ i@@ a. we investigated the relationship between the degeneration of spinal motor neurons and activation of n @-@ methyl @-@ d @-@ aspartate ( nm@@ da ) receptors after neur@@ axial morphine following a non@@ injurious interval of aortic occlusion in rat@@ s. spinal cord ischemia was induced by aortic occlusion for 6 min with a balloon catheter@@ . in a microdialysis study , 10 mu@@ l of saline ( group c ; n = 8 ) or 30 mug of morphine ( group m ; n = 8 ) was injected intra@@ thec@@ ally ( it ) 0.5 h after re@@ flow , and 30 mug of morphine ( group s@@ m ; n = 8 ) or 10 mu@@ l of saline ( group sc ; n = 8 ) was injected it 0.5 h after sham operation@@ . microdialysis samples were collected pre@@ ischemia , before it injection , and at 2 , 4 , 8 , 24 , and 48 h of reperfusion ( after it injection ) . second , we investigated the effect of it m@@ k @-@ 801 ( 30 mug ) on the histopathologic changes in the spinal cord after morphine @-@ induced spastic parap@@ are@@ si@@ s. after it morphine , the cerebrospinal fluid ( cs@@ f ) glutamate concentration was increased in group m relative to both baseline and group c ( p &lt; 0.05 ) . this increase persisted for 8 h@@ rs@@ . it m@@ k @-@ 801 significantly reduced the number of dark @-@ stained alpha @-@ motoneurons after morphine @-@ induced spastic parap@@ aresis compared with the saline grou@@ p. these data indicate that it morphine induces spastic parap@@ aresis with a concomitant increase in cs@@ f glutamate , which is involved in nm@@ da receptor activ@@ ation@@ . we suggest that opioids may be neurotoxic in the setting of spinal cord ischemia via nm@@ da receptor activation .
reduced sodium channel density , altered voltage dependence of inactivation , and increased susceptibility to seizures in mice lacking sodium channel beta 2 @-@ sub@@ un@@ it@@ s. sodium channel beta @-@ subunits modulate channel gating , assembly , and cell surface expression in heterologous cell system@@ s. we generated beta2 ( - / - ) mice to investigate the role of beta2 in control of sodium channel density , localization , and function in neurons in viv@@ o. measurements of &#91; ( 3 ) h &#93; s@@ ax@@ it@@ oxin ( st@@ x ) binding showed a significant reduction in the level of plasma membrane sodium channels in beta2 ( - / - ) neuron@@ s. the loss of beta2 resulted in negative shifts in the voltage dependence of inactivation as well as significant decreases in sodium current density in acutely dissociated hippocampal neuron@@ s. the integral of the compound action potential in optic nerve was significantly reduced , and the threshold for action potential generation was increased , indicating a reduction in the level of functional plasma membrane sodium chann@@ el@@ s. in contrast , the conduction velocity , the number and size of axons in the optic nerve , and the specific localization of na ( v ) 1.6 channels in the nodes of ran@@ vi@@ er were un@@ chang@@ ed@@ . beta2 ( - / - ) mice displayed increased susceptibility to seizures , as indicated by reduced latency and threshold for pilocarpine @-@ induced seizures , but seemed normal in other neurological test@@ s. our observations show that beta2 @-@ subunits play an important role in the regulation of sodium channel density and function in neurons in vivo and are required for normal action potential generation and control of excitability .
screening for stimulant use in adult emergency department seizure patient@@ s. objective : the objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of positive plasma drug screening for cocaine or amphetamine in adult emergency department seizure patient@@ s. methods : this prospective study evaluated consecutive eligible seizure patients who had a plasma sample collected as part of their clinical evalu@@ ation@@ . plasma was tested for amphetamine and the cocaine metabolite benzoyl@@ ec@@ gon@@ ine using enzyme @-@ mediated immunoassay method@@ olog@@ y@@ . plasma samples with benzoyl@@ ec@@ gon@@ ine greater than 150 ng / ml or an amphetamine greater than 500 ng / ml were defined as posi@@ ti@@ ve@@ . patient demographics , history of underlying drug or alcohol @-@ related seizure disorder , estimated time from seizure to sample collection , history or suspicion of cocaine or amphetamine abuse , results of clinical urine testing for drugs of abuse , and assay results were recorded without patient identi@@ fi@@ er@@ s. results : fourteen of 248 ( 5.6 % , 95 % ci 2.7 % -@@ 8.5 % ) plasma samples were positive by immunoassay testing for benzoyl@@ ec@@ gon@@ ine and no samples ( 0 % , 95 % ci 0 @-@ 1.2 % ) were positive for amph@@ et@@ amin@@ e. positive test results were more common in patient visits where there was a history or suspicion of cocaine or amphetamine abuse ( p &lt; 0.0005 ) . conclusions : during this study period , routine plasma screening for cocaine and amph@@ et@@ amines in adult seizure patients had a low yiel@@ d. as a result , routine plasma screening would yield few cases of stimulant drug in which there was neither a history nor suspicion of drug abuse in this population .
evidence of functional somat@@ ot@@ opy in gp@@ i from results of pall@@ id@@ ot@@ omy@@ . the objective of this study was to explore the functional anatomy of the globus pallidus intern@@ us ( gp@@ i ) by studying the effects of unilateral pall@@ id@@ otomy on parkinsonian &apos; off &apos; signs and levodopa @-@ induced dys@@ kine@@ sias ( lid ) . we found significant positive correlations between the preoperative levodopa responsiveness of motor signs and the levodopa responsiveness of scores in timed tests ( core assessment program for intracerebral transplantations ) in the contralateral limbs and the improvement in these scores after surgery , whereas there was no correlation with the improvement in lid@@ . we also found a highly significant correlation ( p : &lt; 0.0001 , r = 0.8 ) between the volume of the ventral lesion in the gp@@ i and the improvement in lid in the contralateral limbs , whereas there was no correlation between the ventral volume and the improvement in parkinsonian &apos; off &apos; sign@@ s. the volumes of the total lesion cylinder and the dorsal lesion did not correlate with the outcome of either dys@@ kine@@ sias or parkinsonian &apos; off &apos; sign@@ s. the differential predictive value of levodopa responsiveness for the outcome of parkinsonian &apos; off &apos; signs and lid and the different correlations of ventral lesion volume with dys@@ kine@@ sias and parkinsonian &apos; off &apos; signs indicate that different anatomical or pathophysiological substrates may be responsible for the generation of parkinsonian &apos; off &apos; signs and dys@@ kine@@ si@@ as@@ . whereas cells in a wider area of the gp@@ i may be implicated in parkinsonism , the ventral gp@@ i seems to be crucial for the manifestation of lid@@ . we suggest that our observations are additional proof of the functional somat@@ ot@@ opy of the systems within the gp@@ i that mediate parkinsonism and dys@@ kine@@ sias , especially along the dor@@ so@@ ventral trajectory used in pall@@ id@@ ot@@ omy@@ . the outcome of pall@@ id@@ otomy in which the lesion involves the ventral and dorsal gp@@ i could be the net effect of alteration in the activity of pathways which mediate different symptoms , and hence could be variable .
pain responses in methadone @-@ maintained opioid ab@@ us@@ er@@ s. providing pain management for known opioid abusers is a challenging clinical task , in part because little is known about their pain experience and analgesic require@@ ment@@ s. this study was designed to describe pain tolerance and analgesic response in a sample of opioid addicts stabilized in methadone @-@ maintenance ( mm ) treatment ( n = 60 ) in comparison to matched non@@ dependent control subjects ( n = 60 ) . by using a placebo @-@ controlled , two @-@ way factorial design , tolerance to cold @-@ pressor ( cp ) pain was examined , both before and after oral administration of therapeutic doses of common opioid ( hydro@@ morph@@ one 2 mg ) and nonsteroidal anti @-@ inflammatory ( ketorolac 10 mg ) analgesic ag@@ ent@@ s. results showed that mm individuals were significantly less tolerant of cp pain than control subjects , replicating previous work@@ . analgesic effects were significant neither for medication nor grou@@ p. these data indicate that mm opioid abusers represent a pain @-@ intolerant subset of clinical patient@@ s. their complaints of pain should be evaluated seriously and managed agg@@ ressively .
urine n @-@ acetyl @-@ beta @-@ d @-@ glucos@@ amin@@ id@@ ase@@ --a marker of tubular damage ? background : although an indicator of renal tubular dysfunction , an increased urinary n @-@ acetyl @-@ beta @-@ d @-@ glucosaminidase ( na@@ g ) activity might reflect increased lysosomal activity in renal tubular cell@@ s. methods : puromycin amin@@ onucle@@ oside ( pan ) was administered to sp@@ rag@@ ue d@@ aw@@ ley rats to induce protein@@ ur@@ i@@ a. total protein , albumin , na@@ g activity and protein electrophoretic pattern were assessed in daily urine samples for 33 day@@ s. the morphological appearance of the kidneys was examined on days three , four , six , eight and thirty three and the na@@ g isoenzyme patterns on days zero , four , eight and thirty thre@@ e. results : following intravenous pan urine volume and urine na@@ g activity increased significantly by day two , but returned to normal by day four@@ . after day four all treated animals exhibited a marked rise in urine albumin , total protein excretion and na@@ g activ@@ it@@ y@@ . electrophoresis showed a generalised increase in middle and high molecular weight urine proteins from day four on@@ war@@ ds@@ . protein droplets first appeared prominent in tubular cells on day four@@ . peak urine na@@ g activity and a change in na@@ g isoenzyme pattern coincided with both the peak proteinuria and the reduction in intracellular protein and na@@ g droplets ( day six onwards ) . conclusions : this animal model demonstrates that an increase in lysosomal turnover and hence urine na@@ g activity , occurs when increased protein is presented to the tubular cell@@ s. urine na@@ g activity is thus a measure of altered function in the renal tubules and not simply an indicator of damage .
over expression of vascular endothelial growth factor and its receptor during the development of estrogen @-@ induced rat pituitary tumors may mediate estrogen @-@ initiated tumor angi@@ ogene@@ si@@ s. estrogens , which have been associated with several types of human and animal cancers , can induce tumor angiogenesis in the pituitary of f@@ ischer 344 rat@@ s. the mechanistic details of tumor angiogenesis induction , during estrogen carcinogenesis , are still un@@ know@@ n@@ . to elucidate the role of estrogen in the regulation of tumor angiogenesis in the pituitary of female rats , the density of blood vessels was analysed using factor vi@@ ii related antigen ( f@@ vi@@ i@@ ir@@ ag ) immunohistochemistry and the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor / vascular permeability factor ( veg@@ f / v@@ p@@ f ) was examined by western blot and immunohistochemical analy@@ si@@ s. the expression of veg@@ f receptor ( veg@@ fr @-@ 2 / fl@@ k @-@ 1 / k@@ d@@ r ) was also examined by immunohisto@@ chemi@@ str@@ y@@ . the results demonstrated that 17beta @-@ estradiol ( e@@ 2 ) induces neovascularization , as well as the growth and enlargement of blood vessels after 7 days of expos@@ ure@@ . the high tumor angiogenic potential was associated with an elevated veg@@ f / v@@ p@@ f protein expression in the e@@ 2 exposed pituitary of ovariectomized ( ove@@ x ) rat@@ s. veg@@ f / v@@ p@@ f and f@@ vi@@ i@@ ir@@ ag immunohistochemistry and endothelial specific lectin ( u@@ e@@ a1 ) binding studies , indicate that the elevation of veg@@ f protein expression initially occurred in both blood vessels and non @-@ endothelial cell@@ s. after 15 days of e@@ 2 exposure , veg@@ f / v@@ p@@ f protein expression , in the non @-@ endothelial cell population , sharply declined and was restricted to the blood v@@ ess@@ el@@ s. the function of non @-@ endothelial @-@ derived veg@@ f is not cl@@ ear@@ . furthermore , immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that veg@@ fr @-@ 2 ( fl@@ k @-@ 1 / k@@ d@@ r ) , expression was elevated significantly in the endothelial cells of micro@@ blood vessels after 7 days of e@@ 2 expos@@ ure@@ . these findings suggest that over expression of veg@@ f and its receptor ( veg@@ fr @-@ 2 ) may play an important role in the initial step of the regulation of estrogen induced tumor angiogenesis in the rat pituitary .

experimental cyclosporine nephrotoxicity : risk of concomitant chemo@@ therap@@ y@@ . the role of cyclosporine ( c@@ sa ) alone or in combination with various chemo@@ therapeutics in the development of renal toxicity was evaluated in rat@@ s. administration of 20 mg / kg / day c@@ sa for 4 weeks caused renal functional and structural changes similar to those reported in man@@ . the combined administration of c@@ sa and various chemotherapeutic drugs with a nephrotoxic potential , such as gentamicin ( at therapeutic doses ) , amph@@ other@@ icin b and ketoconazole , which are frequently used in immunosuppressed patients , did not aggravate the c@@ sa induced toxicity in the rat mod@@ el@@ . gentamicin at toxic doses , however , increased c@@ sa nephro@@ toxic@@ it@@ y@@ . thus , the nephrotoxicity induced by c@@ sa has a different pathogenetic mechanism .
receptor mechanisms of nicotine @-@ induced locomotor hyperactivity in chronic nicotine @-@ treated rat@@ s. rats were pretreated with saline or nicotine ( 1.5 mg / kg per day ) by subcutaneously impl@@ anting each animal with an al@@ z@@ et osmotic mini @-@ pump which continuously released saline or nicotine for 1 , 5 and 14 day@@ s. at the end of each pretreatment period , animals were used for ( i ) determining their locomotor response to acutely injected nicotine ( 0.2 mg / kg , s.c. ) and ( ii ) measuring the density of l@@ - &#91; 3@@ h &#93; nicotine and &#91; 3@@ h &#93; spi@@ per@@ one binding sites in the stri@@ at@@ um@@ . we observed no changes in nicotine @-@ induced locomotor response , striatal l@@ - &#91; 3@@ h &#93; nicotine and &#91; 3@@ h &#93; spi@@ per@@ one binding in the animals pretreated with nicotine for 1 day@@ . in rats which were pretreated with nicotine for 5 days , there was a significant increase in the nicotine @-@ stimulated locomotor response which was associated with an increase in the number of l@@ - &#91; 3@@ h &#93; nicotine binding sites and also with an elevated dopamine ( da ) level in the stri@@ at@@ um@@ . the number of striatal &#91; 3@@ h &#93; spi@@ per@@ one binding sites was not aff@@ ec@@ te@@ d. in animals pretreated with nicotine for 14 days , the nicotine @-@ induced locomotor response remained to be potenti@@ ated@@ . however , this response was correlated with an elevated number of striatal &#91; 3@@ h &#93; spi@@ per@@ one binding sites , whereas the number of striatal l@@ - &#91; 3@@ h &#93; nicotine binding sites and the striatal da level were normal@@ . these results suggest that chronic nicotine @-@ treated rats develop locomotor hyperactivity in response to nicotine initially due to increases of both the density of nicotinic receptors and da concentration , followed by inducing da receptor super@@ sensitivity in the striatum .
hydrocortisone @-@ induced hypertension in humans : pressor responsiveness and sympathetic function@@ . oral hydrocortisone increases blood pressure and enhances pressor responsiveness in normal human subjec@@ ts@@ . we studied the effects of 1 week of oral hydrocortisone ( 200 mg / day ) on blood pressure , cardiac output , total peripheral resistance , forearm vascular resistance , and norepinephrine sp@@ illo@@ ver to plasma in eight healthy male volunte@@ er@@ s. although diastolic blood pressure remained unchanged , systolic blood pressure increased from 119 to 135 mm h@@ g ( sed + / - 3.4 , p less than 0.01 ) , associated with an increased cardiac output ( 5.@@ 85 @-@ 7.@@ 73 l / min , sed + / - 0.46 , p less than 0.01 ) . total peripheral vascular resistance fell from 15.1 to 12.2 mm h@@ g / l / min ( sed + / - 1.03 , p less than 0.05 ) . resting forearm vascular resistance remained unchanged , but the reflex response to the cold pressor test was accentuated , the rise in resistance increasing from 10.5 mm h@@ g / ml / 100 ml / min ( r units ) before treatment to 32.6 r units after treatment ( sed + / - 6.4 , p less than 0.025 ) . the rise in forearm vascular resistance accompanying intra @-@ arterial norepinephrine ( 25 , 50 , and 100 ng / min ) was also significantly greater after hydrocortisone , increasing from an average of 14.9 + / - 2.4 r units before treatment to 35.1 + / - 5.5 r units after hydrocortisone ( sed + / - 6.0 , p less than 0.05 ) . a shift to the left in the dose @-@ response relation and fall in threshold suggested increased sensitivity to norepinephrine after treat@@ ment@@ . measurement of resting norepinephrine sp@@ illo@@ ver rate to plasma and norepinephrine uptake indicated that overall resting sympathetic nervous system activity was not incre@@ as@@ ed@@ . the rise in resting blood pressure with hydrocortisone is associated with an increased cardiac output ( presumably due to increased blood volume ) .

effects of su@@ profen on the isolated perfused rat kidne@@ y@@ . although su@@ profen has been associated with the development of acute renal failure in greater than 100 subjects , the mechanism of damage remains un@@ cl@@ ear@@ . the direct nephrotoxic effects of a single dose of 15 mg of su@@ profen were compared in the recir@@ culating isolated rat kidney perfused with cell @-@ free buffer with or without the addition of 5 mg / dl of uric acid@@ . there were no significant differences in renal sodium excretion , oxygen consumption , or urinary flow rates in kidneys perfused with su@@ profen compared with the drug @-@ free control grou@@ ps@@ . in contrast , a significant decline in glomerular filtration rate was found after the introduction of su@@ profen to the kidney perfused with uric acid ; no changes were found with su@@ profen in the absence of uric acid@@ . a significant decrease in the baseline excretion rate of uric acid was found in rats given su@@ profen , compared with drug @-@ free contro@@ l@@ s. however , the fractional excretion of uric acid was unchanged between the groups over the experimental period@@ . in summary , su@@ profen causes acute declines in renal function , most likely by directly altering the intrarenal distribution of uric acid .
cocaine @-@ induced brainstem seizures and behavi@@ or@@ . a variety of abnormal sensory / motor behaviors associated with electrical discharges recorded from the bilateral brainstem were induced in adult w@@ ky rats by mechanical ( electrode implants ) and dc electrical current stimulations and by acute and chronic administration of coc@@ ain@@ e. the electrode implant implicated one side or the other of the reticular system of the brainstem but subjects were not incap@@ ac@@ itated by the stimul@@ ation@@ s. cocaine ( 40 mg / kg ) was injected subcutaneously for an acute experiment and subsequent 20 mg / kg doses twice daily for 3 days in a chronic stud@@ y@@ . cocaine generated more abnormal behaviors in the brainstem perturbation group , especially the electrically perturb@@ ated subjec@@ ts@@ . the abnormal behaviors were y@@ aw@@ ning , retro@@ coll@@ is , hyperactivity , hypersensitivity , &quot; beating drum &quot; behavior , sque@@ aling , head b@@ ob@@ bing , cir@@ cl@@ ing , s@@ ni@@ ffing , abnormal post@@ uring , and facial tw@@ it@@ ch@@ ing@@ . shifts in the power frequency spectra of the discharge patterns were noted between quiet and pacing behavioral stat@@ es@@ . hypersensitivity to various auditory , tactile , and visual stimulation was present and shifts in the brainstem ambient power spectral frequency occurred in response to tactile stimul@@ ation@@ . these findings suggest that the brainstem generates and propag@@ ates pathological discharges that can be elicited by mechanical and dc electrical perturb@@ ation@@ . cocaine was found to activate the discharge system and thus induce abnormal behaviors that are generated at the discharge site and at distant sites to which the discharge propag@@ at@@ es@@ . cognitive functions may also be involved since dopaminergic and serotonergic cellular elements at the brainstem level are also implicated .
increased sulfation and decreased 7@@ alpha @-@ hydroxylation of deoxycholic acid in eth@@ inyl estradiol @-@ induced cholestasis in rat@@ s. deoxycholic acid conjugation , transport capacity , and metabolism were compared in control and eth@@ inyl estradiol @-@ treated rat@@ s. control rats were found to have a lower capacity to transport deoxycholic acid than tauro@@ deoxycholic acid , and both were decreased by eth@@ inyl estradiol treat@@ ment@@ . during &#91; 24 @-@ 14@@ c &#93; sodium deoxycholate infusion , &#91; 14@@ c &#93; biliary bile acid secretion increased , but bile flow did not change significantly in either control or eth@@ inyl estradiol @-@ treated rat@@ s. eth@@ inyl estradiol @-@ treated animals excreted significantly less 14@@ c as tauro@@ cholic acid than did control animals , consistent with an impairment of 7@@ alpha @-@ hydroxylation of tauro@@ deoxycholic acid@@ . eth@@ inyl estradiol treatment did not impair conjugation of deoxycholic acid , but did result in an increase in sulfation of tauro@@ deoxycholic acid from 1.5 % in controls to nearly 4.0 % ( p less than 0.01 ) . these results are consistent with the hypothesis that the rat has a poorer tolerance for deoxycholic acid than do certain other speci@@ es@@ . furthermore , the rat converts deoxycholic acid , a poor chol@@ ere@@ tic , to tauro@@ cholic acid , a good chol@@ ere@@ tic@@ . when this conversion is impaired with eth@@ inyl estradiol treatment , sulfation may be an important alternate pathway for excretion of this potentially harmful bile acid .
effects of ouabain on myocardial oxygen supply and demand in patients with chronic coronary artery dise@@ as@@ e. a hemodynamic , volumetric , and metabolic study in patients without heart fail@@ ure@@ . the effects of digitalis glycosides on myocardial oxygen supply and demand are of particular interest in the presence of obstructive coronary artery disease , but have not been measured previously in man@@ . we assessed the effects of ouabain ( 0.015 mg / kg body weight ) on hemodynamic , volumetric , and metabolic parameters in 11 patients with severe chronic coronary artery disease without clinical congestive heart fail@@ ure@@ . because the protocol was long and involved interventions which might affect the determinations , we also studied in nine patients using an identical protocol except that ouabain administration was om@@ it@@ te@@ d. left ventricular end @-@ diastolic pressure and left ventricular end @-@ diastolic volume fell in each patient given ouabain , even though they were initially elevated in only two patient@@ s. left ventricular end @-@ diastolic pressure fell from 11.5 + / -@@ 1.4 ( mean + / -@@ se ) to 5.6 + / -0.@@ 9 mm h@@ g ( p less than 0.001 ) and left ventricular end @-@ diastolic volume fell from 100 + / -17 to 82 + / -12 ml / m2 ( p less than 0.01 ) 1 h after ouabain infusion was complet@@ ed@@ . the maximum velocity of contractile element shortening increased from 1.68 + / -0.@@ 11 ml / s to 2.18 + / -0.@@ 21 muscle @-@ lengths / s ( p less than 0.05 ) and is consistent with an increase in contracti@@ lit@@ y@@ . no significant change in these parameters occurred in the control patient@@ s. no significant change in myocardial oxygen consumption occurred after ouabain administration but this may be related to a greater decrease in mean arterial pressure in the ouabain patients than in the control patient@@ s. we conclude that in patients with chronic coronary artery disease who are not in clinical congestive heart failure left ventricular end @-@ diastolic volume falls after ouabain administration even when it is initially normal@@ . though this fall would be associated with a decrease in wall tension , and , therefore , of myocardial oxygen consumption , it may not be of sufficient magnitude to prevent a net increase in myocardial oxygen con@@ sump@@ tion@@ . nevertheless , compensatory mechanisms prevent a deterioration of resting myocardial metabolism .
prolongation of the q@@ t interval related to cis@@ apride @-@ diltiazem inter@@ action@@ . cis@@ apride , a cytochrome p@@ 450 3@@ a@@ 4 ( cyp@@ 3@@ a@@ 4 ) substrate , is widely prescribed for the treatment of gastrointestinal motility dis@@ or@@ der@@ s. prolongation of q@@ t interval , tor@@ s@@ ades de point@@ es , and sudden cardiac death have been reported after concomitant administration with erythromycin or azole antifungal agents , but not with other cyp@@ 3@@ a@@ 4 inhibit@@ or@@ s. a possible drug interaction occurred in a 45 @-@ year @-@ old woman who was taking cis@@ apride for gastroesophageal reflux disorder and diltiazem , an agent that has inhibitory effect on cyp@@ 3@@ a@@ 4 , for hyper@@ ten@@ sion@@ . the patient was in near syncope and had q@@ t @-@ interval prolong@@ ation@@ . after discontinuing cis@@ apride , the q@@ t interval returned to normal and symptoms did not recur@@ . we suggest that caution be taken when cis@@ apride is prescribed with any potent inhibitor of cyp@@ 3@@ a@@ 4 , including diltiazem .

treatment of tacrolimus @-@ related adverse effects by conversion to cyclosporine in liver transplant recipi@@ ent@@ s. when tacrolimus side effects persist despite dose reduction , conversion to cyclosporine @-@ based immunosuppression ( cy@@ a ) is necess@@ ary@@ . we characterized tacrolimus side effects that warranted discontinuation of the drug , and outcomes after conver@@ sion@@ . of 388 liver recipients who received tacrolimus as primary immunosuppression , 70 required conversion to cy@@ a. we recorded indication for conversion , whether conversion was early or late after transplantation , tacrolimus dose and trough blood level at conversion , and incidence of rejection after conver@@ sion@@ . conversion was early in 29 patients ( 4@@ 1.4 % ) and late in 41 ( 5@@ 8.6 % ) . indications for early conversion were neurotoxicity ( 20 ) , ( insulin @-@ dependent ) diabetes mellitus ( id@@ d@@ m ) ( 5 ) , nephrotoxicity ( 3 ) , gastrointestinal ( gi ) toxicity ( 6 ) , and cardiomyopathy ( 1 ) , and for late conversion were neurotoxicity ( 15 ) , id@@ d@@ m ( 12 ) , nephrotoxicity ( 3 ) , gi toxicity ( 5 ) , hepatotoxicity ( 6 ) , post @-@ transplant l@@ m@@ pho@@ proliferate disease ( pt@@ ld ) ( 2 ) , cardiomyopathy ( 1 ) , hemolytic anemia ( 1 ) , and pruritus ( 1 ) . all early @-@ conversion patients showed improvement / resolution of symptom@@ s. among late @-@ conversion patients , 37 ( 9@@ 0.2 % ) had improvement / resolution ; in 4 ( 9.8 % ) , adverse effects persi@@ ste@@ d. the overall rejection rate was 30 % . sixty @-@ two patients ( 8@@ 8.6 % ) are alive with functioning grafts 6@@ 86 + / - 362 days ( range , 154 @-@ 14@@ 33 days ) after conver@@ sion@@ . when tacrolimus side effects are unresponsive to dose reduction , conversion to cy@@ a can be accomplished safely , with no increased risk of rejection and excellent long @-@ term outcome .
relative efficacy and toxicity of ne@@ til@@ mic@@ in and tobramycin in oncology patient@@ s. we prospectively compared the efficacy and safety of ne@@ til@@ mic@@ in sulfate or tobramycin sulfate in conjunction with piperacillin sodium in 118 immunocompromised patients with presumed severe infec@@ tion@@ s. the two treatment regimens were equally efficac@@ i@@ ous@@ . nephrotoxicity occurred in a similar proportion in patients treated with ne@@ til@@ mic@@ in and tobramycin ( 17 % vs 11 % ) . ot@@ otoxicity occurred in four ( 9.5 % ) of 42 ne@@ til@@ mic@@ in and piperacillin and in 12 ( 22 % ) of 54 tobramycin and piperacillin @-@ treated patient@@ s. of those evaluated with post@@ therapy audi@@ ograms , three of four ne@@ til@@ mic@@ in and piperacillin @-@ treated patients had auditory thresholds return to baseline compared with one of nine tobramycin and piperacillin @-@ treated patient@@ s. the number of greater than or equal to 15 @-@ db increases in auditory threshold as a proportion of total greater than or equal to 15 @-@ db changes ( increases and decreases ) was significantly lower in ne@@ til@@ mic@@ in and piper@@ ac@@ il@@ lin@@ - vs tobramycin and piperacillin @-@ treated patients ( 18 of 78 vs 67 of 115 ) . we conclude that aminoglycoside @-@ associated ot@@ otoxicity was less severe and more often reversible with ne@@ til@@ mic@@ in than with tobramycin .

intravenous ribavirin treatment for severe adenovirus disease in immunocompromised child@@ ren@@ . background : adenovirus is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in the immunocompromised ho@@ st@@ . the incidence of severe adenovirus disease in pediatrics is increasing in association with growing numbers of immunocompromised children , where case fatality rates as high as 50 % to 80 % have been repor@@ te@@ d. there are no approved antiviral agents with proven efficacy for the treatment of severe adenovirus disease , nor are there any prospective randomized , controlled trials of potentially useful anti @-@ adenovirus therap@@ i@@ es@@ . apparent clinical success in the treatment of severe adenovirus disease is limited to a few case reports and small ser@@ i@@ es@@ . experience is greatest with intravenous ribavirin and c@@ ido@@ fo@@ vir@@ . ribavirin , a guanosine analogue , has broad antiviral activity against both r@@ na and d@@ na viruses , including documented activity against adenovirus in vit@@ ro@@ . ribavirin is licensed in aerosol form for the treatment of respiratory syncytial virus infection , and orally in combination with interferon to treat hepatitis c. intravenous ribavirin is the treatment of choice for infection with hemorrhagic fever vir@@ us@@ es@@ . the most common adverse effect of intravenous ribavirin is reversible mild an@@ em@@ i@@ a. the use of c@@ ido@@ fovir in severe adenovirus infection has been limited by adverse effects , the most significant of which is nephro@@ toxic@@ it@@ y@@ . objective : we report our experience with intravenous ribavirin therapy for severe adenovirus disease in a series of immunocompromised children and review the liter@@ at@@ ure@@ . design / methods : we retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 5 children treated with intravenous ribavirin for documented severe adenovirus dise@@ as@@ e. two patients developed adenovirus hemorrhagic cystitis after cardiac and bone marrow transplants , respec@@ ti@@ vel@@ y@@ . the bone marrow transplant patient also received intravenous c@@ ido@@ fovir for progressive disseminated dise@@ as@@ e. an additional 3 children developed adenovirus pneumonia ; 2 were neonates , 1 of whom had partial di@@ ge@@ org@@ e syn@@ dro@@ me@@ . the remaining infant had recently undergone a cardiac transpl@@ ant@@ . intravenous ribavirin was administered on a comp@@ assi@@ onate @-@ use protoc@@ ol@@ . results : complete clinical recovery followed later by viral clearance was observed in 2 children : the cardiac transplant recipient with adenovirus hemorrhagic cystitis and the immunocompetent neonate with adenovirus pneumon@@ i@@ a. the remaining 3 children died of adenovirus dise@@ as@@ e. intravenous ribavirin therapy was well toler@@ ated@@ . use of c@@ ido@@ fovir in 1 child was associated with progressive renal failure and neutrop@@ eni@@ a. discussion : our series of patients is representative of the spectrum of immunocompromised children at greatest risk for severe adenovirus disease , namely solid @-@ organ and bone marrow transplant recipients , neonates , and children with immuno@@ defici@@ enc@@ y@@ . although intravenous ribavirin was not effective for all children with severe adenovirus disease in this series or in the literature , therapy is unlikely to be of benefit if begun late in the course of the infec@@ tion@@ . early identification , eg by polymerase chain reaction of those patients at risk of disseminated adenovirus disease may permit earlier antiviral treatment and better evaluation of therapeutic respon@@ se@@ . conclusions : two of 5 children with severe adenovirus disease treated with intravenous ribavirin rec@@ ove@@ red@@ . the availability of newer rapid diagnostic techniques , such as polymerase chain reaction , may make earlier , more effective treatment of adenovirus infection possi@@ ble@@ . given the ser@@ i@@ ousness and increasing prevalence of adenovirus disease in certain hosts , especially children , a large , multicenter clinical trial of potentially useful anti @-@ adenoviral therapies , such as intravenous ribavirin , is clearly required to demonstrate the most effective and least toxic therapy .
hepatotoxicity of amiod@@ ar@@ on@@ e. amiodarone has proved very effective in the treatment of otherwise resistant cardiac tachy@@ arrhyth@@ mi@@ as@@ . the use of amiodarone has , however , been limited due to its serious side @-@ effec@@ ts@@ . a patient with cholestatic hepatitis due to amiodarone treatment is presented below and a review of the hepatotoxicity of amiodarone is gi@@ ven@@ . it is concluded that solid evidence exists of hepatic injury due to amiodarone treatment , including steatosis , alterations resembling alcoholic hepatitis , cholestatic hepatitis and micron@@ odular cirrhosis of the li@@ ver@@ . patients receiving amiodarone should be regularly screened with respect to hepatic enzyme lev@@ el@@ s. therapy should be discontinued on the suspicion of cholestatic injury or hepatomegaly .
catal@@ epsy induced by combinations of ketamine and morphine : potentiation , antagonism , tolerance and cross @-@ tolerance in the rat@@ . previous studies demonstrated that both ketamine and morphine induced analgesia and catal@@ epsy in the rat@@ . pre @-@ treatment with ketamine produced cross @-@ tolerance to morphine , whereas pretreatment with morphine did not induce cross @-@ tolerance to ketamine but rather augmented the catal@@ eptic response ; this augmentation was attributed to residual morphine in the bra@@ in@@ . the present studies explored the duration of the loss of r@@ ighting reflex induced by sub @-@ effective doses of ketamine and morphine , administered simult@@ ane@@ ous@@ ly@@ . there was mutual potentiation between sub @-@ effective doses of ketamine and morphine , but sub @-@ effective doses of ketamine partly antagonized fully @-@ effective doses of morph@@ ine@@ . latency to the loss of r@@ ighting reflex , rigidity and behavior on recovery , reflected the relative predominance of ketamine or morphine in each combin@@ ation@@ . naloxone inhibited the induced catal@@ eptic effec@@ ts@@ . the degree and time course of development of tolerance to daily administration of sub @-@ effective dose combinations of ketamine and morphine were simil@@ ar@@ . rats , tolerant to ketamine @-@ dominant combinations , were cross @-@ tolerant to both drugs , while those tolerant to morphine @-@ dominant combinations were cross @-@ tolerant to morphine but showed either no cross @-@ tolerance or an augmented response to ket@@ amin@@ e. while the mutual potentiation , antagonism and tolerance suggest common mechanisms for the induced catal@@ epsy , differences in latency , rigidity and behavior , asymmetry of cross @-@ tolerance and a widely @-@ different id@@ 50 for naloxone would argue against an action at a single opioid site .
acute renal failure in patients with aids on tenofovir while receiving prolonged vancomycin course for oste@@ omyel@@ iti@@ s. renal failure developed after a prolonged course of vancomycin therapy in 2 patients who were receiving tenofovir dis@@ opro@@ x@@ il fumarate as part of an antiretroviral reg@@ im@@ en@@ . tenofovir has been implicated in the development of f@@ an@@ coni syndrome and renal insufficiency because of its effects on the proximal renal tubul@@ e. vancomycin nephrotoxicity is infrequent but may result from coadministration with a nephrotoxic ag@@ ent@@ . clinicians should be aware that tenofovir may raise the risk of renal failure during prolonged administration of vancomycin .
delayed leukoencephalopathy with stroke @-@ like presentation in chemotherapy recipi@@ ent@@ s. background : a transient leukoencephalopathy mimicking cerebrovascular accident has been described as a complication of chemotherapy , most commonly in recipients of intrathecal methotrexate for childhood leuk@@ aem@@ i@@ a. recently published neuroimaging data suggest a common pathophysiology associated with a variety of chemotherapy agents and modes of administr@@ ation@@ . methods : we reviewed the medical literature for single reports and case series of patients presenting with stroke @-@ like episodes while receiving systemic or intrathecal chemo@@ therap@@ y@@ . we only included studies providing detailed neuroimaging dat@@ a. patients with cerebrovascular accidents were exclu@@ de@@ d. results : we identified 27 reports of toxic leukoencephalopathy in patients treated with methotrexate ( intrathecal , systemic ) , 5 @-@ fluorouracil and its derivative car@@ mo@@ fur , and cap@@ ec@@ it@@ ab@@ ine@@ . diffusion weighted imaging ( d@@ w@@ i ) of all patients revealed well demarc@@ ated hyperintense lesions within the subcortical white matter of the cerebral hemispheres and the corpus callosum , corresponding to areas of decreased proton diffusion on apparent diffusion coefficient ( ad@@ c ) maps ( available in 21 / 27 patients ) . lesions exceeded the con@@ fin@@ es of adjacent vascular territ@@ ori@@ es@@ . complete resolution of symptoms within 1 @-@ 4 days was accompanied by normal@@ isation of ad@@ c abnormal@@ iti@@ es@@ . however , fluid attenuated inversion recovery ( fl@@ air ) sequences frequently revealed persistent white matter abnormal@@ iti@@ es@@ . conclusions : several pathophysiological models of delayed leukoencephalopathy after exposure to intrathecal or systemic chemotherapy have been propos@@ ed@@ . d@@ w@@ i findings in this cohort are indicative of cytotoxic oedema within cerebral white matter and lend support to an at least partially reversible metabolic derangement as the basis for this syndrome .
down @-@ regulation of norepinephrine transporter function induced by chronic administration of desipramine linking to the alteration of sensitivity of local @-@ anesthetics @-@ induced convulsions and the counter@@ action by co @-@ administration with local anesthe@@ tic@@ s. alterations of norepinephrine transporter ( net ) function by chronic inhibition of net in relation to sensitization to seizures induce by cocaine and local anesthetics were studied in mic@@ e. daily administration of desipramine , an inhibitor of the net , for 5 days decreased &#91; ( 3 ) h &#93; norepinephrine uptake in the p2 fractions of hippocampus but not cortex , striatum or amygdal@@ a@@ e. co @-@ administration of lidocaine , bupivacaine or tric@@ aine with desipramine reversed this effec@@ t. daily treatment of cocaine increased &#91; ( 3 ) h &#93; norepinephrine uptake into the hippocamp@@ us@@ . daily administration of desipramine increased the incidence of appearance of lidocaine @-@ induced convulsions and decreased that of cocaine @-@ induced convul@@ sion@@ s. co @-@ administration of lidocaine with desipramine reversed the changes of convulsive activity of lidocaine and cocaine induced by repeated administration of desi@@ pr@@ amin@@ e. these results suggest that down @-@ regulation of hippocampal net induced by chronic administration of desipramine may be relevant to desipramine @-@ induced sensitization of lidocaine convul@@ sion@@ s. inhibition of na ( + ) channels by local anesthetics may regulate desipramine @-@ induced down @-@ regulation of net function@@ . repeated administration of cocaine induces up @-@ regulation of hippocampal net function@@ . desipramine @-@ induced sensitization of lidocaine seizures may have a mechanism distinct from kindling resulting from repeated administration of cocaine .
definition and management of anemia in patients infected with hepatitis c vir@@ us@@ . chronic infection with hepatitis c virus ( h@@ cv ) can progress to cirrhosis , hepatocellular carcinoma , and end @-@ stage liver dise@@ as@@ e. the current best treatment for h@@ cv infection is combination therapy with pegylated interferon and rib@@ avir@@ in@@ . although this regimen produces sustained virologic responses ( s@@ v@@ rs ) in approximately 50 % of patients , it can be associated with a potentially dose @-@ limiting hemolytic an@@ em@@ i@@ a. hemoglobin concentrations decrease mainly as a result of ribavirin @-@ induced hemolysis , and this anemia can be problematic in patients with h@@ cv infection , especially those who have comorbid renal or cardiovascular dis@@ or@@ der@@ s. in general , anemia can increase the risk of morbidity and mortality , and may have negative effects on cerebral function and quality of lif@@ e. although ribavirin @-@ associated anemia can be reversed by dose reduction or discontinuation , this approach compromises outcomes by significantly decreasing s@@ v@@ r rat@@ es@@ . recombinant human erythropoietin has been used to manage ribavirin @-@ associated anemia but has other potential dis@@ advant@@ ag@@ es@@ . vir@@ amidine , a liver @-@ targeting prodrug of ribavirin , has the potential to maintain the virologic efficacy of ribavirin while decreasing the risk of hemolytic anemia in patients with chronic hepatitis c .
calcium carbonate toxicity : the updated milk @-@ alkali syndrome ; report of 3 cases and review of the liter@@ at@@ ure@@ . objective : to describe 3 patients with calcium carbonate @-@ induced hypercalcemia and gain insights into the cause and management of the milk @-@ alkali syn@@ dro@@ me@@ . methods : we report the clinical and laboratory data in 3 patients who presented with severe hypercalcemia ( corrected serum calcium &gt; or = 14 mg / dl ) and review the pertinent literature on milk @-@ alkali syn@@ dro@@ me@@ . results : the 3 patients had acute renal insufficiency , relative metabolic alkalosis , and low parathyroid hormone ( p@@ th ) , p@@ th @-@ related peptide , and 1,25 @-@ dihydroxyvitamin d concentr@@ ation@@ s. no malignant lesion was found@@ . treatment included aggressive hydration and varied amounts of furo@@ sem@@ ide@@ . the 2 patients with the higher serum calcium concentrations received p@@ amid@@ ronate intravenously ( 60 and 30 mg , respectively ) , which caused severe hypocalc@@ em@@ i@@ a. of the 3 patients , 2 were ing@@ esting acceptable doses of elemental calcium ( 1 g and 2 g daily , respectively ) in the form of calcium carbon@@ at@@ e. in addition to our highlighted cases , we review the history , classification , pathophysiologic features , and treatment of milk @-@ alkali syndrome and summarize the cases reported from early 1995 to nov@@ ember 200@@ 3. conclusion : milk @-@ alkali syndrome may be a common cause of unexplained hypercalcemia and can be precipitated by small amounts of orally ingested calcium carbonate in susceptible person@@ s. treatment with hydration , furosemide , and discontinuation of the calcium and vitamin d source is adequ@@ at@@ e. p@@ amid@@ ronate treatment is associated with considerable risk for hypocalcemia , even in cases of initially severe hypercalcemia .
management strategies for ribavirin @-@ induced hemolytic anemia in the treatment of hepatitis c : clinical and economic implic@@ ation@@ s. objectives : recently published studies have demonstrated increased efficacy and cost @-@ effectiveness of combination therapy with interferon and alpha @-@ 2b / ribavirin compared with interferon @-@ alpha monotherapy in the treatment of chronic hepatitis c ( ch@@ c ) . combination therapy is associated with a clinically important adverse effect : ribavirin @-@ induced hemolytic anemia ( ri@@ ha ) . the objective of this study was to evaluate the direct health @-@ care costs and management of ri@@ ha during treatment of ch@@ c in a clinical trial set@@ tin@@ g. methods : a systematic literature review was conducted to synthesize information on the incidence and management of ri@@ ha@@ . decision @-@ analytic techniques were used to estimate the cost of treating ri@@ ha@@ . uncertainty was evaluated using sensitivity analy@@ ses@@ . results : ri@@ ha , defined as a reduction in hemoglobin to less than 100 g / l , occurs in approximately 7 % to 9 % of patients treated with combination therap@@ y@@ . the standard of care for management of ri@@ ha is reduction or discontinuation of the ribavirin dos@@ ag@@ e. we estimated the direct cost of treating clinically significant ri@@ ha to be 170 per patient receiving combination therapy per 48 @-@ week treatment course ( range 6@@ 8- 6@@ 92 ) . the results of the one @-@ way sensitivity analyses ranged from 57 to 3@@ 17@@ . in comparison , the cost of 48 weeks of combination therapy is 16,@@ 45@@ 9@@ . conclusions : the direct cost of treating clinically significant ri@@ ha is 1 % ( 170 / 16,@@ 4@@ 59 ) of drug treatment cost@@ s. questions remain about the optimal dose of ribavirin and the incidence of ri@@ ha in a real @-@ world popul@@ ation@@ . despite these uncertainties , this initial evaluation of the direct cost of treating ri@@ ha provides an estimate of the cost and management implications of this clinically important adverse effect .
effects of amine pretreatment on ketamine cat@@ at@@ onia in pineal@@ ectomized or hypophysectomized anim@@ al@@ s. the present studies were designed to clarify the role of catecholamines and pineal id@@ ol@@ amines on ketamine @-@ induced cat@@ at@@ onia in the intact , pineal@@ ectomized or hypophysectomized chick and rat@@ . in the pineal@@ ectomized chick , pretreatment with dopamine increased the duration of cat@@ at@@ onia ( do@@ c ) after ketamine , but pretreatment with norepinephrine did not@@ . the pineal indol@@ amines exhibited mixed action@@ s. serotonin and n @-@ acetyl serotonin which augmented ketamine do@@ c , did not do so in the absence of the pineal gland , whereas melatonin potentiated the ketamine do@@ c in both the intact and pineal@@ ectomized chick@@ . ketamine was more potent in the hypophysectomized chick and the circadian rhythm noted in the intact chick was absent ; furthermore , melatonin did not augment the ketamine do@@ c whereas dopamine continued to do so@@ . this study did not demonstrate a species difference regarding the role of the amines on the pineal in spite of the immature blood @-@ brain barrier in the young chick and the intact barrier in the rat@@ . in addition , these data indicate a direct role of the pituitary in the augmentation of ketamine do@@ c induced by mel@@ at@@ on@@ in@@ . furthermore , dopamine appeared to act on systems more closely involved with the induction of ketamine cat@@ at@@ onia rather than directly on the pituitary .
multicenter , double @-@ blind , multiple @-@ dose , parallel @-@ groups efficacy and safety trial of az@@ elas@@ tine , chlor@@ phen@@ ir@@ amine , and placebo in the treatment of spring allergic rh@@ initi@@ s. az@@ elas@@ tine , a novel anti@@ allergic medication , was compared with chlor@@ phen@@ ir@@ amine maleate and placebo for efficacy and safety in the treatment of spring allergic rhinitis in a multicenter , double @-@ blind , multiple @-@ dose , parallel @-@ groups stud@@ y@@ . one hundred fifty @-@ five subjects particip@@ ated@@ . subjects ranged in age from 18 to 60 years of age and had at least a 2 @-@ year history of spring allergic rhinitis , confirmed by positive skin test to spring aero@@ aller@@ gen@@ s. medications were given four times daily ; the az@@ elas@@ tine groups received 0.5 , 1.0 , or 2.0 mg in the morning and evening with placebo in the early and late afternoon ; the chlor@@ phen@@ ir@@ amine group received 4.0 mg four times d@@ ail@@ y@@ . daily subject symptom cards were completed during a screening period to assess pretreatment symptoms and during a 4 @-@ week treatment period while subjects received study medic@@ ation@@ s. individual symptoms , total symptoms , and major symptoms were compared to determine efficacy of medic@@ ation@@ . elicited , volunte@@ ered , and observed adverse experiences were recorded for each subject and compared among grou@@ ps@@ . vital signs , body weights , serum chemistry values , complete blood cell counts , urine studies , and electrocardiograms were obtained for each subject and compared among grou@@ ps@@ . symptoms relief in the group receiving the highest concentration of az@@ elas@@ tine ( 2.0 mg twice daily ) was statistically greater than in the placebo group during all weeks of the stud@@ y@@ . lower doses of az@@ elas@@ tine were statistically more effective than placebo only during portions of the first 3 weeks of the stud@@ y@@ . in contrast , although the chlor@@ phen@@ ir@@ amine group did have fewer symptoms than the placebo group during the study , the difference never reached statistical significance during any week of the stud@@ y@@ . there were no serious side effects in any of the treatment grou@@ ps@@ . drow@@ siness and altered taste perception were increased significantly over placebo only in the high @-@ dose az@@ elas@@ tine grou@@ p. az@@ elas@@ tine appears to be a safe , efficacious medication for seasonal allergic rhinitis .

prolonged paralysis due to non@@ depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents and cortico@@ steroid@@ s. the long @-@ term use of non@@ depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents ( nd @-@ nm@@ ba ) has recently been implicated as a cause of prolonged muscle weakness , although the site of the lesion and the predisposing factors have been un@@ cl@@ ear@@ . we report 3 patients ( age 37 @-@ 52 years ) with acute respiratory insufficiency who developed prolonged weakness following the discontinuation of nd @-@ nm@@ bas@@ . two patients also received intravenous cortico@@ steroid@@ s. renal function was normal but hepatic function was impaired in all patients , and all had acid@@ osi@@ s. electrophysiologic studies revealed low amplitude compound motor action potentials , normal sensory studies , and fibrill@@ ation@@ s. repetitive stimulation at 2 h@@ z showed a decre@@ mental response in 2 patient@@ s. the serum vecuronium level measured in 1 patient 14 days after the drug had been discontinued was 172 ng / m@@ l@@ . a muscle biopsy in this patient showed loss of thick , myosin filam@@ ent@@ s. the weakness in these patients is due to pathology at both the neuromuscular junction ( most likely due to nd @-@ nm@@ ba ) and muscle ( most likely due to corticosteroids ) . hepatic dysfunction and acidosis are contributing risk factors .
prostaglandin e@@ 2 @-@ induced bladder hyperactivity in normal , conscious rats : involvement of tachy@@ kinins ? in normal conscious rats investigated by continuous cyst@@ ometry , intra@@ vesi@@ cally instilled prostaglandin ( pg ) e@@ 2 facilitated micturition and increased basal intravesical pres@@ su@@ re@@ . the effect was attenuated by both the n@@ k1 receptor selective antagonist r@@ p 6@@ 7,@@ 580 and the n@@ k2 receptor selective antagonist s@@ r 48@@ ,@@ 9@@ 68 , given intra @-@ arter@@ ially , suggesting that it was mediated by stimulation of both n@@ k1 and n@@ k2 recep@@ tor@@ s. intra @-@ arter@@ ially given p@@ ge@@ 2 produced a distinct increase in bladder pressure before initiating a micturition reflex , indicating that the pg had a direct contrac@@ tant effect on the detrusor smooth mus@@ cle@@ . the effect of intra @-@ arterial p@@ ge@@ 2 could not be blocked by intra @-@ arterial r@@ p 6@@ 7,@@ 580 or s@@ r 48@@ ,@@ 9@@ 68 , which opens the possibility that the micturition reflex elicited by intra @-@ arterial p@@ ge@@ 2 was mediated by pathways other than the reflex initiated when the pg was given intra@@ vesi@@ call@@ y@@ . the present results thus suggest that intra @-@ arterial p@@ ge@@ 2 , given near the bladder , may initiate micturition in the normal rat chiefly by directly contracting the smooth muscle of the detr@@ us@@ or@@ . however , when given intra@@ vesi@@ cally , p@@ ge@@ 2 may stimulate micturition by releasing tachy@@ kinins from nerves in and / or immediately below the uroth@@ eli@@ um@@ . these tachy@@ kinins , in turn , initiate a micturition reflex by stimulating n@@ k1 and n@@ k2 recep@@ tor@@ s. prost@@ anoids may , via release of tachy@@ kinins , contribute to both urge and bladder hyperactivity seen in inflammatory conditions of the lower urinary tract .
thiazide diuretics , hypokalemia and cardiac arrhyth@@ mi@@ as@@ . thiazide diuretics are widely accepted as the cornerstone of antihypertensive treatment program@@ s. hypokalemia is a commonly encountered metabolic consequence of chronic thiazide therap@@ y@@ . we treated 38 patients ( 22 low renin , 16 normal renin ) with moderate diastolic hypertension with hydrochlorothiazide ( h@@ ct@@ c ) administered on a twice daily sched@@ ul@@ e. initial dose was 50 mg and the dose was increased at monthly intervals to 100 mg , 150 mg and 200 mg daily until blood pressure normal@@ iz@@ ed@@ . the serum k during the control period was 4.5 + / - 0.2 me@@ q / l an on 50 , 100 , 150 and 200 mg h@@ c@@ tz daily 3.9 + / - 0.3 , 3.4 + / - 0.2 , 2.9 + / - 0.2 , and 2.4 + / - 0.3 me@@ q / l , respec@@ ti@@ vel@@ y@@ . corresponding figures for whole body k were 4@@ 107 + / - 208 , 37@@ 22 + / - 319 , 36@@ 28 + / - 257 , 35@@ 51 + / - 336 , and 32@@ 69 + / - 380 me@@ q , respec@@ ti@@ vel@@ y@@ . in 13 patients we observed the effects of h@@ c@@ tz therapy ( 100 mg daily ) on the occurrence of p@@ v@@ c &apos;s during rest as well as during static and dynamic exerc@@ is@@ e. during rest we observed 0.6 + / - 0.08 p@@ v@@ c beats / min + / - se@@ m and during static and dynamic exercise 0.6 + / - 0.06 and 0.8 + / - 0.15 , respec@@ ti@@ vel@@ y@@ . corresponding figures during h@@ c@@ tz therapy 100 mg daily were 1.4 + / - 0.1 , 3.6 + / - 0.7 and 5.7 4 / - 0.8 , respec@@ ti@@ vel@@ y@@ . the occurrence of p@@ v@@ c &apos;s correlated significantly with the fall in serum k + observed r = 0.72 , p less than 0.00@@ 1@@ . in conclusion we found that thiazide diuretics cause hypokalemia and depletion of body pot@@ assi@@ um@@ . the more profound hypokalemia , the greater the propensity for the occurrence of p@@ v@@ c &apos;s .
diuretics , potassium and arrhythmias in hypertensive coronary dise@@ as@@ e. it has been proposed that modest changes in plasma potassium can alter the tendency towards cardiac arrhyth@@ mi@@ as@@ . if this were so , patients with coronary artery disease might be especially suscepti@@ ble@@ . thus , myocardial electrical excitability was measured in patients with mild essential hypertension and known coronary artery disease after 8 weeks of treatment with a potassium @-@ conserving diuretic ( amiloride ) and a similar period on a potassium @-@ losing diuretic ( chlor@@ thal@@ idone ) in a randomised stud@@ y@@ . plasma potassium concentrations were on average 1 mmol / l lower during the chlor@@ thal@@ idone phase compared to amiloride therap@@ y@@ . blood pressure and volume states as assessed by bodyweight , plasma renin and noradrenaline ( norepinephrine ) concentrations were similar on the 2 reg@@ im@@ ens@@ . compared to amiloride treatment , the chlor@@ thal@@ idone phase was associated with an increased frequency of ventricular ectopic beats ( 24 @-@ hour hol@@ ter monitoring ) and a higher low@@ n grading , increased up@@ slope and duration of the monophasic action potential , prolonged ventricular effective refractory period , and increased electrical instability during programmed ventricular stimul@@ ation@@ . the above results indicate that because potassium @-@ losing diuretic therapy can increase myocardial electrical excitability in patients with ischaemic heart disease , even minor falls in plasma potassium concentrations are probably best avoided in such patients .
gab@@ a involvement in naloxone induced reversal of respiratory paralysis produced by thi@@ opent@@ al@@ . no agent is yet available to reverse respiratory paralysis produced by c@@ ns depress@@ ants , such as general anesthe@@ tic@@ s. in this study naloxone reversed respiratory paralysis induced by thiopental in rats . 25 mg / kg , i.v. thiopental produced anesthesia without altering respiratory rate , increased gab@@ a , decreased glutamate , and had no effect on aspartate or glycine levels compared to controls in rat cortex and brain stem@@ . pretreatment of rats with thi@@ os@@ em@@ ic@@ arb@@ azide for 30 minutes abolished the anesthetic action as well as the respiratory depressant action of thiopental . 50 mg / kg , i.v. thiopental produced respiratory arrest with further increase in gab@@ a and decrease in glutamate again in cortex and brain stem without affecting any of the amino acids studied in four regions of rat bra@@ in@@ . naloxone ( 2.5 mg / kg , i.v. ) reversed respiratory paralysis , glutamate and gab@@ a levels to control values in brain stem and cortex with no changes in caudate or cerebell@@ um@@ . these data suggest naloxone reverses respiratory paralysis produced by thiopental and involves gab@@ a in its action .

nociceptive effects induced by intrathecal administration of prostaglandin d2 , e@@ 2 , or f2 alpha to conscious mic@@ e. the effects of intrathecal administration of prostaglandins on pain responses in conscious mice were evaluated by using hot plate and acetic acid wri@@ thing test@@ s. prostaglandin d2 ( 0.5 @-@ 3 ng / mouse ) had a hyper@@ algesic action on the response to a hot plate during a 3 @-@ 60 min period after injec@@ tion@@ . prostaglandin e@@ 2 showed a hyper@@ algesic effect at doses of 1 pg to 10 ng / mouse , but the effect lasted shorter ( 3 @-@ 30 min ) than that of prostaglandin d@@ 2. similar results were obtained by acetic acid wri@@ thing test@@ s. the hyper@@ algesic effect of prostaglandin d2 was blocked by simultaneous injection of a substance p antagonist ( greater than or equal to 100 ng ) but not by ah@@ 6@@ 80@@ 9 , a prostanoid ep@@ 1 @-@ receptor antagon@@ ist@@ . conversely , prostaglandin e@@ 2 @-@ induced hyperalgesia was blocked by ah@@ 6@@ 80@@ 9 ( greater than or equal to 500 ng ) but not by the substance p antagon@@ ist@@ . prostaglandin f2 alpha had little effect on pain respon@@ ses@@ . these results demonstrate that both prostaglandin d2 and prostaglandin e@@ 2 exert hyperalgesia in the spinal cord , but in different ways .
swallowing @-@ induced atrial tachy@@ arrhythmia triggered by salbutamol : case report and review of the liter@@ at@@ ure@@ . case : a 49 @-@ year @-@ old patient experienced chest discomfort while sw@@ allow@@ ing@@ . on electrocardiogram , episodes of atrial tachy@@ arrhythmia were recorded immediately after swallowing ; 24 @-@ hour hol@@ ter monitoring recorded several event@@ s. the arrhythmia resolved after therapy with atenolol , but recurred a year later@@ . the patient noticed that before these episodes he had been using an inhal@@ ator of salbut@@ am@@ ol@@ . after stopping the beta @-@ agonist , and after a week with the atenolol , the arrhythmia dis@@ appe@@ are@@ d. discussion : swallowing @-@ induced atrial tachy@@ arrhythmia ( si@@ at ) is a rare phenomen@@ on@@ . fewer than 50 cases of si@@ at have been described in the liter@@ at@@ ure@@ . this article summarizes all the cases published , creating a comprehensive review of the current knowledge and approach to si@@ at@@ . it discusses demographics , clinical characteristics and types of arrhythmia , postulated mechanisms of si@@ at , and different treatment possibilities such as medications , surgery , and radiofrequency catheter ablation ( r@@ f@@ ca ) . conclusion : salbutamol is presented here as a possible trigger for si@@ at@@ . although it is difficult to define causality in a case report , it is logical to think that a beta @-@ agonist like salbutamol ( known to induce tachycardia ) may be the trigger of adrenergic reflexes originating in the esophagus while swallowing and that a beta @-@ blocker such as atenolol ( that blocks the adrenergic activity ) may relieve it .
coenzyme q@@ 10 treatment ameliorates acute cisplatin nephrotoxicity in mic@@ e. the nephro@@ protective effect of coenzyme q@@ 10 was investigated in mice with acute renal injury induced by a single i.p. injection of cisplatin ( 5 mg / kg ) . coenzyme q@@ 10 treatment ( 10 mg / kg / day , i.p. ) was applied for 6 consecutive days , starting 1 day before cisplatin administr@@ ation@@ . coenzyme q@@ 10 significantly reduced blood urea nitrogen and serum creatinine levels which were increased by cis@@ pl@@ atin@@ . coenzyme q@@ 10 significantly compensated deficits in the antioxidant defense mechanisms ( reduced glutathione level and superoxide dismutase activity ) , suppressed lipid peroxidation , decreased the elevations of tumor necrosis factor @-@ alpha , nitric oxide and platinum ion concentration , and attenuated the reductions of selenium and zinc ions in renal tissue resulted from cisplatin administr@@ ation@@ . also , histopathological renal tissue damage mediated by cisplatin was ameliorated by coenzyme q@@ 10 treat@@ ment@@ . immunohistochemical analysis revealed that coenzyme q@@ 10 significantly decreased the cisplatin @-@ induced overexpression of inducible nitric oxide synthase , nuclear factor @-@ kappa@@ b , caspase @-@ 3 and p53 in renal tissu@@ e. it was concluded that coenzyme q@@ 10 represents a potential therapeutic option to protect against acute cisplatin nephrotoxicity commonly encountered in clinical practice .
metformin prevents experimental gentamicin @-@ induced nephropathy by a mitochondria @-@ dependent path@@ w@@ ay@@ . the antidiabetic drug metformin can diminish apoptosis induced by oxidative stress in endothelial cells and prevent vascular dysfunction even in nondiabetic patient@@ s. here we tested whether it has a beneficial effect in a rat model of gentamicin toxic@@ it@@ y@@ . mitochondrial analysis , respiration intensity , levels of reactive oxygen species , permeability transition , and cytochrome c release were assessed 3 and 6 days after gentamicin administr@@ ation@@ . metformin treatment fully blocked gentamicin @-@ mediated acute renal fail@@ ure@@ . this was accompanied by a lower activity of n @-@ acetyl @-@ beta @-@ d @-@ glucosaminidase , together with a decrease of lipid peroxidation and increase of antioxidant system@@ s. metformin also protected the kidney from histological damage 6 days after gentamicin administr@@ ation@@ . these in vivo markers of kidney dysfunction and their correction by metformin were complemented by in vitro studies of mitochondrial function@@ . we found that gentamicin treatment depleted respiratory components ( cytochrome c , nad@@ h ) , probably due to the opening of mitochondrial transition po@@ res@@ . these injuries , partly mediated by a rise in reactive oxygen species from the electron transfer chain , were significantly decreased by met@@ form@@ in@@ . thus , our study suggests that pleiotropic effects of metformin can less@@ en gentamicin nephrotoxicity and improve mitochondrial homeostasis .
sedation depth during spinal anesthesia and the development of postoperative delirium in elderly patients undergoing hip fracture re@@ pair@@ . objective : to determine whether limiting intraoperative sedation depth during spinal anesthesia for hip fracture repair in elderly patients can decrease the prevalence of postoperative del@@ ir@@ i@@ um@@ . patients and methods : we performed a double @-@ blind , randomized controlled trial at an academic medical center of elderly patients ( &gt; or = 65 years ) without preoperative delirium or severe dementia who underwent hip fracture repair under spinal anesthesia with propofol sed@@ ation@@ . sedation depth was titrated using processed electroencephalography with the bispec@@ tral index ( bis ) , and patients were randomized to receive either deep ( bis , approximately 50 ) or light ( bis , &gt; or = 80 ) sed@@ ation@@ . postoperative delirium was assessed as defined by diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders ( third edition revised ) criteria using the confusion assessment method beginning at any time from the second day after surg@@ ery@@ . results : from april 2 , 2005 , through oc@@ tober 30 , 2008 , a total of 114 patients were random@@ iz@@ ed@@ . the prevalence of postoperative delirium was significantly lower in the light sedation group ( 11 / 57 &#91; 19 % &#93; vs 23 / 57 &#91; 40 % &#93; in the deep sedation group ; p = .02 ) , indicating that 1 incident of delirium will be prevented for every 4.7 patients treated with light sed@@ ation@@ . the mean + / - sd number of days of delirium during hospitalization was lower in the light sedation group than in the deep sedation group ( 0.5 + / -@@ 1.5 days vs 1.4 + / -@@ 4.0 days ; p = .01 ) . conclusion : the use of light propofol sedation decreased the prevalence of postoperative delirium by 50 % compared with deep sed@@ ation@@ . limiting depth of sedation during spinal anesthesia is a simple , safe , and cost @-@ effective intervention for preventing postoperative delirium in elderly patients that could be widely and readily adopted .
sorafenib @-@ induced acute myocardial infarction due to coronary artery spas@@ m. a 65 @-@ year @-@ old man with advanced renal cell carcinoma was admitted due to continuing chest pain at rest@@ . two weeks before his admission , sorafenib had been star@@ te@@ d. he was diagnosed with non @-@ st @-@ elevation myocardial infarction by laboratory data and electrocardi@@ ogram@@ . enhanced heart magnetic resonance imaging also showed sub@@ endocardial infarc@@ tion@@ . however , there was no stenosis in coronary arteries on angi@@ og@@ rap@@ hy@@ . coronary artery spasm was induced by a provocative test@@ . cessation of sorafenib and administration of ca @-@ channel blocker and nitrates ameliorated his symptoms , but relapse occurred after resumption of sor@@ afen@@ ib@@ . addition of oral nic@@ or@@ andi@@ l reduced his symptoms and maintained stable angina stat@@ us@@ . we report the first case of sorafenib @-@ induced coronary artery spas@@ m. sorafenib is a multi@@ kinase inhibitor that targets signaling pathways necessary for cellular proliferation and survi@@ val@@ . on the other hand , the rho / rock pathway has an important role in the pathogenesis of coronary artery spas@@ m. our report may show an adverse effect on the rho / rock pathway by sorafenib use .
anxi@@ ogenic potential of ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin in rat@@ s. introduction : the possible anxi@@ ogenic effects of fluoroquinolones , namely ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin , were investigated in adult char@@ les foster albino rats of either sex , weighing 150 @-@ 200 g. methods : the drugs were given orally , in doses of 50 mg / kg for five consecutive days and the experiments were performed on the fifth day@@ . the tests included open @-@ field exploratory behaviour , elevated plus maze and elevated zero maze , social interaction and novelty @-@ suppressed feeding latency behavi@@ our@@ . results : the results indicate that ci@@ prof@@ lox@@ acin@@ - and norfloxacin @-@ treated rats showed anxious behaviour in comparison to control rats in all the parameters studi@@ ed@@ . however , ci@@ prof@@ lox@@ acin@@ - and norfloxacin @-@ treated rats did not differ significantly from each other in various behavioural parameter@@ s. conclusion : the present experimental findings substantiate the clinically observed anxi@@ ogenic potential of ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin .
myocardial f@@ as ligand expression increases susceptibility to az@@ t @-@ induced cardiomy@@ opath@@ y@@ . background : dilated cardiomyopathy ( d@@ cm ) and myocarditis occur in many hi@@ v @-@ infected individuals , resulting in symptomatic heart failure in up to 5 % of patient@@ s. highly active antiretroviral therapy ( ha@@ art ) has significantly reduced morbidity and mortality of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( aids ) , but has resulted in an increase in cardiac and skeletal my@@ opath@@ i@@ es@@ . methods and results : in order to investigate whether the ha@@ art component zidovudine ( 3 &apos; -@@ azido @-@ 2 &apos; , 3 &apos; -deoxy@@ thymidine ; az@@ t ) triggers the f@@ as @-@ dependent cell @-@ death pathway and cause cytoskeletal disruption in a murine model of d@@ cm , 8 @-@ week @-@ old transgenic ( expressing f@@ as ligand in the myocardium : fas@@ l t@@ g ) and non @-@ transgenic ( nt@@ g ) mice received water ad libitum containing different concentrations of az@@ t ( 0 , 0.07 , 0.2 , and 0.7 mg / ml ) . after 6 weeks , cardiac function was assessed by echocardiography and morphology was assessed by histopathologic and immunohistochemical method@@ s. nt@@ g and untreated fas@@ l t@@ g mice showed little or no change in cardiac structure or function@@ . in contrast , az@@ t @-@ treated fas@@ l t@@ g mice developed cardiac dilation and depressed cardiac function in a dose @-@ dependent manner , with concomitant inflammatory infiltration of both ventr@@ ic@@ les@@ . these changes were associated with an increased sarcolemmal expression of f@@ as and fas@@ l , as well as increased activation of caspase 3 , translocation of calpain 1 to the sarcolemma and sarcomere , and increased numbers of cells undergoing apopto@@ si@@ s. these were associated with changes in dystrophin and cardiac troponin i localization , as well as loss of sarcolemmal integr@@ it@@ y@@ . conclusions : the expression of f@@ as ligand in the myocardium , as identified in hi@@ v @-@ positive patients , might increase the susceptibility to ha@@ art @-@ induced cardiomyopathy due to activation of apoptotic pathways , resulting in cardiac dilation and dysfunction .
valproate @-@ induced chore@@ a and encephalopathy in atypical non@@ ket@@ otic hyper@@ glycin@@ em@@ i@@ a. non@@ ket@@ otic hyper@@ glycin@@ emia is a disorder of amino acid metabolism in which a defect in the glycine cleavage system leads to an accumulation of glycine in the brain and other body compartment@@ s. in the classical form it presents as neonatal apnea , intractable seizures , and hypotonia , followed by significant psychomotor retard@@ ation@@ . an important subset of children with non@@ ket@@ otic hyper@@ glycin@@ emia are atypical variants who present in a heterogeneous man@@ ner@@ . this report describes a patient with mild language delay and mental retardation , who was found to have non@@ ket@@ otic hyper@@ glycin@@ emia following her presentation with acute encephalopathy and chore@@ a shortly after initiation of valproate therapy .
microinjection of rit@@ anserin into the ca@@ 1 region of hippocampus improves scopolamine @-@ induced amnesia in adult male rat@@ s. the effect of rit@@ anserin ( 5 @-@ ht@@ 2 antagonist ) on scopolamine ( muscarinic cholinergic antagonist ) -induced amnesia in mor@@ ris water maze ( m@@ w@@ m ) was investig@@ ated@@ . rats were divided into eight groups and bilaterally cannulated into ca@@ 1 region of the hippocamp@@ us@@ . one week later , they received repeatedly vehicles ( saline , dm@@ so , saline + dm@@ so ) , scopolamine ( 2 microg / 0.5 microl saline / side ; 30 min before training ) , rit@@ anserin ( 2 , 4 and 8 microg / 0.5 microl dm@@ so / side ; 20 min before training ) and scopolamine ( 2 microg / 0.5 microl ; 30 min before rit@@ anserin injection ) + rit@@ anserin ( 4 microg / 0.5 microl dm@@ so ) through cann@@ ulae each day@@ . animals were tested for four consecutive days ( 4 trial / day ) in m@@ w@@ m during which the position of hidden platform was un@@ chang@@ ed@@ . in the fifth day , the platform was elevated above the water surface in another position to evaluate the function of motor , motivational and visual system@@ s. the results showed a significant increase in escape latencies and travel@@ ed distances to find platform in scopolamine @-@ treated group as compared to saline grou@@ p. rit@@ anserin @-@ treated rats ( 4 microg / 0.5 microl / side ) showed a significant decrease in the mentioned parameters as compared to dm@@ so @-@ treated grou@@ p. however , scopolamine and rit@@ anserin co @-@ administration resulted in a significant decrease in escape latencies and travel@@ ed distances as compared to the scopolamine @-@ treated rat@@ s. our findings show that microinjection of rit@@ anserin into the ca@@ 1 region of the hippocampus improves the scopolamine @-@ induced amnesia .
hypoxia in renal disease with proteinuria and / or glomerular hyper@@ ten@@ sion@@ . despite the increasing need to identify and quantify tissue oxygenation at the cellular level , relatively few methods have been avail@@ ab@@ le@@ . in this study , we developed a new hypoxia @-@ responsive reporter vector using a hypoxia @-@ responsive element of the 5 &apos; vascular endothelial growth factor untranslated region and generated a novel hypoxia @-@ sensing transgenic rat@@ . we then applied this animal model to the detection of tubulointerstitial hypoxia in the diseased kidne@@ y@@ . with this model , we were able to identify diffuse cortical hypoxia in the puromycin amin@@ onucle@@ oside @-@ induced nephrotic syndrome and focal and segmental hypoxia in the remnant kidney mod@@ el@@ . expression of the hypoxia @-@ responsive transgene increased throughout the observation period , reaching 2.2 @-@ fold at 2 weeks in the puromycin amin@@ onucle@@ oside model and 2.6 @-@ fold at 4 weeks in the remnant kidney model , whereas that of vascular endothelial growth factor showed a mild decrease , reflecting distinct behaviors of the two gen@@ es@@ . the degree of hypoxia showed a positive correlation with microscopic tubulointerstitial injury in both mod@@ el@@ s. finally , we identified the localization of proliferating cell nuclear antigen @-@ positive , ed @-@ 1 @-@ positive , and terminal d@@ ut@@ p nick @-@ end labeled @-@ positive cells in the hypoxic cortical area in the remnant kidney mod@@ el@@ . we propose here a possible pathological tie between chronic tubulointerstitial hypoxia and progressive glomerular diseases .
consensus statement concerning cardiotoxicity occurring during haematopoietic stem cell transplantation in the treatment of autoimmune diseases , with special reference to systemic sclerosis and multiple scler@@ osi@@ s. autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplantation is now a feasible and effective treatment for selected patients with severe autoimmune dise@@ as@@ es@@ . worldwide , over 650 patients have been transplanted in the context of phase i and ii clinical tri@@ al@@ s. the results are encouraging enough to begin randomised phase iii tri@@ al@@ s. however , as predicted , significant transplant @-@ related morbidity and mortality have been obser@@ ve@@ d. this is primarily due to complications related to either the stage of the disease at transplant or due to infec@@ tion@@ s. the number of deaths related to cardiac toxicity is low@@ . however , caution is required when cyclophosphamide or anthracyclines such as mitoxantrone are used in patients with a possible underlying heart damage , for example , systemic sclerosis patient@@ s. in nov@@ ember 2002 , a meeting was held in flo@@ rence , bringing together a number of experts in various fields , including rheumatology , cardiology , neurology , pharmacology and transplantation medic@@ ine@@ . the object of the meeting was to analyse existing data , both published or available , in the euro@@ pe@@ an group for blood and marrow transplantation autoimmune disease database , and to propose a safe approach to such patient@@ s. a full cardi@@ ological assessment before and during the transplant emerged as the major recommendation .
immunohistochemical study on inducible type of nitric oxide ( in@@ os ) , basic fibroblast growth factor ( b@@ f@@ g@@ f ) and tumor growth factor @-@ beta1 ( t@@ g@@ f @-@ beta1 ) in arteritis induced in rats by fen@@ ol@@ dop@@ am and theophylline , vasodi@@ lat@@ or@@ s. arteritis induced in rats by vasodilators , fen@@ ol@@ dop@@ am and theophylline , was examined immunohistochemically for expressions of inducible type of nitric oxide synthase ( in@@ os ) , basic fibroblast growth factor ( b@@ f@@ g@@ f ) and tumor growth factor @-@ beta1 ( t@@ g@@ f @-@ beta1 ) . rats were administered fen@@ ol@@ dop@@ am for 24 hours by intravenous infusion with or without following repeated daily oral administrations of the@@ ophyl@@ lin@@ e. irrespective of theophylline administration , in@@ os antigens were remarkably abundant in ed @-@ 1 @-@ positive cells on day 5 and 8 post @-@ fen@@ ol@@ dop@@ am @-@ infusion ( d@@ pi ) ; b@@ f@@ g@@ f antigens were remarkably abundant in ed @-@ 1 @-@ positive cells on 1 and 3 d@@ pi ; t@@ g@@ f @-@ beta1 antigens were observed in ed @-@ 1 @-@ positive cells on and after 5 d@@ pi@@ . these results suggest that the peak expression of in@@ os antigen was followed by that of b@@ f@@ g@@ f antigen , and b@@ f@@ g@@ f may have a suppressive effect on in@@ os expression in these rat arteritis mod@@ el@@ s. on the other hand , t@@ g@@ f @-@ beta1 was not considered to have a suppressive effect on in@@ os expression in these models .
low @-@ molecular @-@ weight heparin for the treatment of patients with mechanical heart val@@ v@@ es@@ . background : the interruption of oral anticoagulant ( o@@ ac ) administration is sometimes indicated in patients with mechanical heart valves , mainly before noncardiac surgery , non @-@ surgical interventions , and pregn@@ anc@@ y@@ . unfractionated heparin ( u@@ h ) is currently the substitute for selected patient@@ s. low @-@ molecular @-@ weight heparin ( l@@ m@@ w@@ h ) offers theoretical advantages over u@@ h , but is not currently considered in clinical guidelines as an alternative to u@@ h in patients with prosthetic val@@ v@@ es@@ . hypothesis : the aim of the present study was to review the data accumulated so far on the use of l@@ m@@ w@@ h in this patient population and to discuss its applicability in common practic@@ e. methods : for this paper , the current medical literature on l@@ m@@ w@@ h in patients with mechanical heart valves was extensively revie@@ wed@@ . results : there were eight series and six case repor@@ ts@@ . none of the studies was randomized , and only one was prospec@@ ti@@ ve@@ . data to establish the thromboembolic risk were in@@ complet@@ e. after excluding case reports , the following groups were constructed : ( a ) short @-@ term administration , after valve insertion ( n = 212 ) ; ( b ) short @-@ term , perioperative ( noncardiac ) / peri@@ procedural ( n = 114 ) ; ( c ) long @-@ term , due to intolerance to o@@ ac ( n = 16 ) ; ( d ) long @-@ term , in pregnancy ( n = 10 ) . the incidence rate of thromboembolism was 0.9 % for all the studies and 0.5 , 0 , 20 , and 0 % in groups a , b , c , and d , respectively ; for hemorrhage , the overall rate was 3.4 % ( 3.8 , 2.6 , 10 , and 0 % for the respective groups ) . conclusions : in patients with mechanical heart valves , short @-@ term l@@ m@@ w@@ h therapy compares favorably with u@@ h@@ . data on mid@@ - and long @-@ term l@@ m@@ w@@ h administration in these patients are spar@@ se@@ . further randomized studies are needed to confirm the safety and precise indications for the use of l@@ m@@ w@@ h in patients with mechanical heart valves .

spironolactone : is it a novel drug for the prevention of amphotericin b @-@ related hypokalemia in cancer patients ? objective : nephrotoxicity is the major adverse effect of amphotericin b ( am@@ b ) , often limiting administration of full dos@@ ag@@ e. selective distal tubular epithelial toxicity seems to be responsible for the profound potassium wasting that is a major clinical side effect of treatment with amb@@ . potassium depletion also potentiates the tubular toxicity of amb@@ . this study was designed to assess the ability of spironolactone to reduce potassium requirements and to prevent hypokalemia in neutropenic patients on am@@ b treat@@ ment@@ . methods : in this study 26 patients with various hematological disorders were randomized to receive either intravenous am@@ b alone or am@@ b and oral spironolactone 100 mg twice daily when developing a proven or suspected fungal infec@@ tion@@ . results : patients receiving concomitant am@@ b and spironolactone had significantly higher plasma potassium levels than those receiving am@@ b alone ( p = 0.00@@ 27 ) . those patients receiving am@@ b and spironolactone required significantly less potassium supplementation to maintain their plasma potassium within the normal range ( p = 0.022 ) . moreover , urinary potassium losses were significantly less in patients receiving am@@ b and spironolactone than those receiving am@@ b alone ( p = 0.040 ) . conclusion : this study showed that spironolactone can reduce potassium requirements and prevent hypokalemia by reducing urinary potassium loss in neutropenic patients on am@@ b treatment .
dopamine d2 receptor signaling controls neuronal cell death induced by muscarinic and glutamatergic dru@@ g@@ s. dopamine ( da ) , through d1 / d2 receptor @-@ mediated signaling , plays a major role in the control of epileptic seizures arising in the limbic system@@ . excitotoxicity leading to neuronal cell death in the affected areas is a major consequence of seizures at the cellular lev@@ el@@ . in this respect , little is known about the role of da receptors in the occurrence of epilepsy @-@ induced neuronal cell de@@ ath@@ . here we analyze the occurrence of seizures and neurotoxicity in d@@ 2@@ r - / - mice treated with the cholinergic agonist pil@@ ocar@@ pine@@ . we compared these results with those previously obtained with kainic acid ( ka ) , a potent glutamate agon@@ ist@@ . importantly , d@@ 2@@ r - / - mice develop seizures at doses of both drugs that are not epileptogenic for wt littermates and show greater neuro@@ toxic@@ it@@ y@@ . however , pilocarpine @-@ induced seizures result in a more widespread neuronal death in both wt and d@@ 2@@ r - / - brains in comparison to ka@@ . thus , the absence of d@@ 2@@ r lowers the threshold for seizures induced by both glutamate and acetyl@@ chol@@ ine@@ . moreover , the dopaminergic control of epilepsy @-@ induced neurodegeneration seems to be mediated by distinct interactions of d@@ 2@@ r signaling with these two neurotransmitters .

structural and functional impairment of mitochondria in adriamycin @-@ induced cardiomyopathy in mice : suppression of cytochrome c oxidase ii gene expres@@ sion@@ . the use of adriamycin ( ad@@ r ) in cancer chemotherapy has been limited due to its cumulative cardiovascular toxic@@ it@@ y@@ . earlier observations that ad@@ r interacts with mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase ( co@@ x ) and suppresses its enzyme activity led us to investigate ad@@ r &apos;s action on the cardiovascular functions and heart mitochondrial morphology in bal@@ b @-@ c mice i.p. treated with ad@@ r for several week@@ s. at various times during treatment , the animals were assessed for cardiovascular functions by electrocardiography and for heart tissue damage by electron microscop@@ y@@ . in parallel , total r@@ na was extracted from samples of dissected heart and analyzed by northern blot hybridization to determine the steady @-@ state level of three r@@ na transcripts encoded by the co@@ xi@@ i , co@@ xi@@ ii , and co@@ xi@@ v gen@@ es@@ . similarly , samples obtained from the liver of the same animals were analyzed for comparative studi@@ es@@ . our results indicated that 1 ) treatment of mice with ad@@ r caused cardiovascular arrhythmias characterized by bradycardia , extension of ventricular depolarization time ( t@@ q@@ rs ) , and failure of q@@ rs at high concentrations ( 10 @-@ 14 mg / kg body weight cumulative dose ) ; 2 ) the heart mitochondria underwent swelling , fusion , dissolution , and / or disruption of mitochondrial crist@@ ae after several weeks of treat@@ ment@@ . such abnormalities were not observed in the mitochondria of liver tissue ; and 3 ) among the three genes of co@@ x enzyme examined , only co@@ xi@@ i gene expression was suppressed by ad@@ r treatment , mainly after 8 weeks in both heart and li@@ ver@@ . knowing that heart mitochondria represent almost 40 % of heart muscle by weight , we conclude that the deteriorating effects of ad@@ r on cardiovascular function involve mitochondrial structural and functional impairment .
enhanced bradycardia induced by beta @-@ adrenoceptor antagonists in rats pretreated with isoni@@ az@@ id@@ . high doses of isoniazid increase hypotension induced by vasodilators and change the accompanying reflex tachycardia to bradycardia , an interaction attributed to decreased synthesis of brain gamma @-@ aminobutyric acid ( gab@@ a ) . in the present study , the possible enhancement by isoniazid of bradycardia induced by beta @-@ adrenoceptor antagonists was determined in rats anaesthe@@ tised with chlor@@ al@@ ose @-@ ureth@@ ane@@ . isoniazid significantly increased bradycardia after propranolol , p@@ indolol , lab@@ et@@ alol and atenolol , as well as after clonidine , but not after hexam@@ ethonium or carb@@ ach@@ ol@@ . enhancement was not observed in rats pretreated with methyl@@ atropine or previously vag@@ otom@@ is@@ ed@@ . these results are compatible with interference by isoniazid with gab@@ a@@ ergic inhibition of cardiac parasympathetic ton@@ e. such interference could be exerted centrally , possibly at the nucleus ambigu@@ us , or peripherally at the sinus node .

clarithromycin @-@ induced ventricular tachycardi@@ a. clarithromycin is a relatively new macrolide antibiotic that offers twice @-@ daily dos@@ ing@@ . it differs from erythromycin only in the methylation of the hydroxyl group at position 6@@ . although the side @-@ effect profile of erythromycin is established , including gastroenteritis and interactions with other drugs subject to hepatic mixed @-@ function oxidase metabolism , experience with the newer macrolides is still being recor@@ de@@ d. cardiotoxicity has been demonstrated after both intravenous and oral administration of erythromycin but has never been reported with the newer macro@@ lid@@ es@@ . we report a case of ventricular dys@@ rhyth@@ mias that occurred after six therapeutic doses of cl@@ ari@@ throm@@ y@@ cin@@ . the dys@@ rhyth@@ mias resolved after discontinuation of the drug .
persistent nephro@@ genic diabetes insipidus following lithium therap@@ y@@ . we report the case of a patient who developed severe hyper@@ nat@@ ra@@ emic dehydration following a head injur@@ y@@ . ten years previously he had been diagnosed to have lithium @-@ induced nephro@@ genic diabetes insipidus , and lithium therapy had been discontinu@@ ed@@ . he remained thir@@ st@@ y and poly@@ uric despite cessation of lithium and investigations on admission showed him to have normal osmo@@ regulated thir@@ st and vasopressin secretion , with clear evidence of nephro@@ genic diabetes insi@@ p@@ id@@ us@@ . lithium induced nephro@@ genic diabetes insipidus is considered to be reversible on cessation of therapy but poly@@ uria persisted in this patient for ten years after lithium was stop@@ ped@@ . we discuss the possible renal mechanisms and the implications for management of patients with lithium @-@ induced nephro@@ genic diabetes insipidus .
late cardiotoxicity after treatment for a malignant bone tumor@@ . cardiac function was assessed in long @-@ term survivors of malignant bone tumors who were treated according to ros@@ en &apos;s t@@ 5 or t@@ 10 protocol , both including dox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in@@ . thirty @-@ one patients , age 10 @-@ 45 years ( median age 17.8 years ) were evaluated 2.3 @-@ 14.1 years ( median 8.9 years ) following completion of treat@@ ment@@ . cumulative doses of doxorubicin were 225 @-@ 550 mg / m2 ( median dose 360 ) . the evaluation consisted of a history , physical examination , electrocardiogram ( ec@@ g ) , signal averaged ec@@ g , 24 @-@ hour ambulatory ec@@ g , echocardiography and radionuclide angi@@ og@@ rap@@ hy@@ . eighteen of 31 ( 58 % ) patients showed cardiac toxicity , defined as having one or more of the following abnormalities : late potentials , complex ventricular arrhythmias , left ventricular dilation , decreased shortening fraction , or decreased ejection fraction@@ . the incidence of cardiac abnormalities increased with length of follow @-@ up ( p &lt; or = .05 ) . no correlation could be demonstrated between cumulative dose of doxorubicin and cardiac status , except for heart rate vari@@ abil@@ it@@ y@@ . when adjusted to body surface area , the left ventricular posterior wall thickness ( l@@ v@@ p@@ w index ) was decreased in all patient@@ s. the incidence of doxorubicin @-@ induced cardiotoxicity is high and increases with follow @-@ up , irrespective of cumulative dos@@ e. life @-@ long cardiac follow @-@ up in these patients is warran@@ te@@ d. the results of our study suggest that heart rate variability and l@@ v@@ p@@ w index could be sensitive indicators for cardiotoxicity .
venous complications of midazolam versus di@@ azep@@ am@@ . although some studies have suggested fewer venous complications are associated with midazolam than with diazepam for endoscopic procedures , this variable has not been well docum@@ ente@@ d. we prospectively evaluated the incidence of venous complications after intravenous injection of diazepam or midazolam in 122 consecutive patients undergoing colonoscopy and esophag@@ ogastro@@ duoden@@ oscop@@ y@@ . overall , venous complications were more frequent with diazepam ( 22 of 62 patients ) than with midazolam ( 4 of 60 patients ) ( p &lt; 0.001 ) . a palpable venous cord was present in 23 % ( 14 of 62 ) of patients in the diazepam group , compared with 2 % ( 1 of 60 patients ) in the midazolam group ( p &lt; 0.002 ) . pain at the injection site occurred in 35 % ( 22 of 62 ) of patients in the diazepam group compared with 7 % ( 4 of 60 patients ) in the midazolam group ( p &lt; 0.001 ) . swelling and war@@ m@@ th at the injection site were not significantly different between the two grou@@ ps@@ . smoking , nonsteroidal anti @-@ inflammatory drug use , intravenous catheter site , dwell time of the needle , alcohol use , and pain during the injection had no effect on the incidence of venous complications .
tet@@ any and rhabdomyolysis due to sur@@ rep@@ ti@@ tious furo@@ sem@@ ide@@ --@@ importance of magnesium suppl@@ ement@@ ation@@ . diuretics may induce hypokalemia , hypocalcemia and hypom@@ agnes@@ em@@ i@@ a. while severe hypokalemia may cause muscle weakness , severe hypom@@ agnes@@ emia is associated with muscle spasms and tet@@ any which cannot be corrected by potassium and calcium supplementation alone ( 1,2 ) . sur@@ rep@@ ti@@ tious diuretic ingestion has been described , mainly in women who are concerned that they are obese or ede@@ mat@@ ous@@ . symptomatic hypokalemia has been reported in such patients ( 3 @-@ 7 ) and in one case hypocalcemia was observed ( 8 ) , but the effects of magnesium depletion were not noted in these patients .
loss of glutamate decarboxylase m@@ r@@ na @-@ containing neurons in the rat dentate gyrus following pilocarpine @-@ induced seiz@@ u@@ res@@ . in situ hybridization methods were used to determine if glutamic acid decarboxylase ( g@@ ad ) m@@ r@@ na @-@ containing neurons within the hil@@ us of the dentate gyrus are vulnerable to seizure @-@ induced damage in a model of chronic seiz@@ u@@ res@@ . sp@@ rag@@ ue @-@ d@@ aw@@ ley rats were injected intraperitoneally with pilocarpine , and the hippocampal formation was studied histologically at 1 , 2 , 4 , and 8 week intervals after pilocarpine @-@ induced seiz@@ u@@ res@@ . in situ hybridization histochemistry , using a dig@@ ox@@ igenin @-@ labeled g@@ ad cr@@ na probe , demonstrated a substantial decrease in the number of g@@ ad m@@ r@@ na @-@ containing neurons in the hil@@ us of the dentate gyrus in the pilocarpine @-@ treated rats as compared to controls at all time inter@@ val@@ s. additional neuron@@ anatomical studies , including cres@@ yl violet staining , neuronal degeneration methods , and histochemical localization of glial fibrillary acidic protein , suggested that the decrease in the number of g@@ ad m@@ r@@ na @-@ containing neurons was related to neuronal loss rather than to a decrease in g@@ ad m@@ r@@ na lev@@ el@@ s. the loss of g@@ ad m@@ r@@ na @-@ containing neurons in the hil@@ us contrasted with the relative preservation of labeled putative basket cells along the inner margin of the granule cell lay@@ er@@ . quantitative analyses of labeled neurons in three regions of the dentate gyrus in the 1 and 2 week groups showed statistically significant decreases in the mean number of g@@ ad m@@ r@@ na @-@ containing neurons in the hil@@ us of both groups of experimental anim@@ al@@ s. no significant differences were found in the molecular layer or the granule cell layer , which included labeled neurons along the lower margin of the granule cell lay@@ er@@ . the results indicate that , in this model , a subpopulation of g@@ ad m@@ r@@ na @-@ containing neurons within the dentate gyrus is selectively vulnerable to seizure @-@ induced dam@@ ag@@ e. such differential vulnerability appears to be another indication of the heterogeneity of gab@@ a neurons .
protective effect of misoprostol on indomethacin induced renal dysfunction in elderly patient@@ s. objective : to evaluate the possible protective effects of misoprostol on renal function in hospitalized elderly patients treated with in@@ dometh@@ acin@@ . methods : forty @-@ five hospitalized elderly patients ( &gt; 65 years old ) who required therapy with nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs ( n@@ said ) were randomly assigned to receive either indomethacin , 150 mg / day ( group a ) , or indomethacin 150 mg / day plus misoprostol at 0.6 mg / day ( group b ) . laboratory variables of renal function &#91; serum creatinine , blood urea nitrogen ( bu@@ n ) and electrolytes &#93; were evaluated before initiation of therapy and every 2 days , until termination of the study ( a period of at least 6 days ) . response to treatment was estimated by the visual analog scale for severity of pain@@ . results : forty @-@ two patients completed the study , 22 in group a and 20 in group b@@ . bu@@ n and creatinine increased by &gt; 50 % of baseline levels in 54 and 45 % of group a patients , respectively , compared to only 20 and 10 % of group b patients ( p &lt; 0.05 ) . potassium ( k ) increment of 0.6 me@@ q / l or more was observed in 50 % of group a , but in only 15 % of group b patients ( p &lt; 0.05 ) . the mean increments in bu@@ n , creatinine , and k were reduced by 63 , 80 , and 42 % , respectively , in group b patients compared to group a. response to treatment did not differ significantly between the 2 grou@@ ps@@ . conclusion : hospitalized elderly patients are at risk for developing indomethacin related renal dys@@ function@@ . addition of misoprostol can minimize this renal impairment without affecting pain control .
nephrotoxic effects of aminoglycoside treatment on renal protein reabsorption and accum@@ ul@@ ation@@ . to quantify the effects of gentamicin , kanamycin and ne@@ til@@ mic@@ in on renal protein reabsorption and accumulation , these drugs were administered to rats intraperitoneally ( 30 mg / kg / day ) for 7 , 14 or 21 day@@ s. scanning electron microscopy of the glomerular endoth@@ elia , urinary measurements of sodium , potassium , endogenous lysozyme , n @-@ acetyl @-@ beta @-@ d @-@ glucosaminidase ( na@@ g ) as well as clearance and accumulation experiments after i.v. administration of egg @-@ white lysozyme and measurements of inulin clearance ( g@@ fr ) were done in each treatment grou@@ p. gentamicin administration decreased diameter , density and shape of endothelial fene@@ stra@@ e. kanamycin and ne@@ til@@ mic@@ in appeared to have no effect at the dose us@@ ed@@ . all three aminoglycosides decreased g@@ fr and increased urinary excretion of sodium and pot@@ assi@@ um@@ . while gentamicin and kanamycin decreased the percentage reabsorption and accumulation of lysozyme after i.v. administration of egg @-@ white lysozyme ne@@ til@@ mic@@ in had no effec@@ t. daily excretion of total protein , endogenous lysozyme and na@@ g increased only after treatment with kanamycin and gentam@@ ic@@ in@@ . thus , aminoglycosides may act as nephro@@ toxicants at glomerular and / or tubular level inducing impairment of renal reabsorption and accumulation of proteins .
pharmacology of gy@@ ki @-@ 41 0@@ 99 ( chlor@@ propanol , tob@@ anum ) a new potent beta @-@ adrenergic antagon@@ ist@@ . the compound gy@@ ki @-@ 41 0@@ 99 , as a beta @-@ adrenergic antagonist , is 3 @-@ 8 times more potent than propranolol in vitro and in viv@@ o. its antiarrhythmic effectiveness sur@@ passes that of propranolol and p@@ indolol inhibiting the ouabain arrhythmia in dogs and cat@@ s. gy@@ ki @-@ 41 900 has a negligible cardio@@ depressant activity ; it is not cardi@@ oselec@@ ti@@ ve@@ . the compound shows a rapid and long lasting effec@@ t. there was a prolonged elimination of the radioactivity after the injection of 14@@ c @-@ 41 0@@ 99 to rats and dog@@ s. the half life of the unlabeled substance in humans was more than 10 hours .

reversal of ammonia coma in rats by l @-@ dopa : a peripheral effec@@ t. ammonia coma was produced in rats within 10 to 15 minutes of an intraper@@ itone@@ al@@ injection of 1.7 mmol n@@ h@@ 4@@ cl@@ . this coma was prevented with 1.68 mmol l @-@ dopa given by gastric intubation 15 minutes before the ammonium salt injec@@ tion@@ . the effect of l @-@ dopa was correlated with a decrease in blood and brain ammonia , an increase in brain dopamine , and an increase in renal excretion of ammonia and ure@@ a. intraventricular infusion of dopamine sufficient to raise the brain dopamine to the same extent did not prevent the ammonia coma nor affect the blood and brain ammonia concentr@@ ation@@ s. bilateral nephrectomy eliminated the beneficial effect of l @-@ dopa on blood and brain ammonia and the ammonia coma was not preven@@ te@@ d. thus , the reduction in blood and brain ammonia and the prevention of ammonia coma after l @-@ dopa , can be accounted for by the peripheral effect of dopamine on renal function rather than its central action@@ . these results provide a reasonable explanation for the beneficial effects observed in some encephal@@ opathic patients receiving l @-@ dopa .
heparin @-@ induced thrombocytopenia after liver transpl@@ ant@@ ation@@ . background : unfractionated heparin sodium ( u@@ f@@ h ) or low @-@ molecular weight heparin ( l@@ m@@ w@@ h ) is used in anticoagulant protocols at several institutions to prevent thrombosis after liver transpl@@ ant@@ ation@@ . heparin @-@ induced thrombocytopenia ( hit ) is an adverse immune @-@ mediated reaction to heparin , resulting in platelet count decreases of more than 50 % . the frequencies of hit after liver transplantation and platelet factor 4 / heparin @-@ reactive antibody ( hit antibody ) positivity in liver transplantation patients , however , are un@@ know@@ n@@ . patients and methods : the 32 men and 20 women underwent living donor liver transpl@@ ant@@ ation@@ . we started l@@ m@@ w@@ h ( 25 i@@ u / kg / h ) on postoperative day ( pod ) 1 , switching to u@@ f@@ h ( 5000 u / d ) on pod 2 or 3. the dose of u@@ f@@ h was changed according to the activated clotting time lev@@ el@@ . hit antibody levels were measured the day before surgery and on pod 7 and 14@@ . platelet count was measured daily for 3 week@@ s. results : the average platelet counts preoperatively , and on pod 7 , 14 , and 21 were 65 , 88 , 149 , and 169 x 10 ( 9 ) / l , respec@@ ti@@ vel@@ y@@ . two patients developed hepatic artery thrombosis on pod 11 and 19 , respectively , although they were hit antibody @-@ negative and their platelet counts were st@@ ab@@ le@@ . in 2 other patients , the platelet count decreased suddenly from 107 x 10 ( 9 ) / l on pod 4 to 65 x 10 ( 9 ) / l on pod 6 and from 76 x 10 ( 9 ) / l on pod 7 to 33 x 10 ( 9 ) / l on pod 9 , respec@@ ti@@ vel@@ y@@ . the heparin @-@ induced platelet aggregation test was negative in these patient@@ s. the percentage of hit antibody @-@ positive patients was 0.5 % preoperatively , 5.6 % on pod 7 , and 5.6 % on pod 14@@ . none of the subjects / patients developed u@@ f@@ h @-@ related h@@ it@@ . conclusions : in our series , the occurrence of hit after liver transplantation was uncommon .

angioedema associated with dro@@ peridol administr@@ ation@@ . angioedema , also known as angi@@ oneuro@@ tic edema or qu@@ inc@@ ke &apos;s disease , is a well @-@ demarc@@ ated , localized edema involving the subcutaneous tissues that may cause upper @-@ airway obstruc@@ tion@@ . we report the case of a previously healthy 19 @-@ year @-@ old man with no known drug allergies in whom angioedema with significant tongue swelling and protrusion developed within 10 minutes of the administration of a single iv dose of dro@@ peridol .
clarithromycin @-@ associated visual hallucinations in a patient with chronic renal failure on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialy@@ si@@ s. visual hallucinations are a rare event in chronic renal failure and not related to uremia per se@@ . unreported in the literature is visual hallucinations occurring in association with the new macrolide antibiotic , cl@@ ari@@ throm@@ y@@ cin@@ . we describe such a case in a patient with end @-@ stage renal disease ( es@@ rd ) maintained on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis ( cap@@ d ) . the combination of a relatively high dose of clarithromycin in face of chronic renal failure in a functionally aneph@@ ric patient , with underlying aluminum intoxication , may have facilitated the appearance of this neurotoxic side effec@@ t. it is important to understand the pharmacokinetics of medications in face of chronic renal failure , the possibility of drug interactions , and how these factors should help guide medication therapy in the es@@ rd patient .
acute renal toxicity of doxorubicin ( adriamycin ) -@@ loaded cyanoacrylate nanop@@ arti@@ cl@@ es@@ . acute doxorubicin @-@ loaded nanoparticle ( d@@ x@@ n@@ p ) renal toxicity was explored in both normal rats and rats with experimental glomerul@@ oneph@@ ri@@ tis@@ . in normal rats , 2 / 6 rats given free doxorubicin ( d@@ x ) ( 5 mg / kg ) died within one week , whereas all control animals and all rats having received free n@@ p or d@@ x@@ n@@ p survi@@ ve@@ d. a 3 times higher proteinuria appeared in animals treated with d@@ x@@ n@@ p than in those treated with d@@ x@@ . free n@@ p did not provoke any protein@@ ur@@ i@@ a. two hr post @-@ injection , d@@ x@@ n@@ p was 2.7 times more concentrated in kidneys than free d@@ x ( p &lt; 0.025 ) . in rats with immune experimental glomerulonephritis , 5 / 6 rats given d@@ x died within 7 days , in contrast to animals treated by d@@ x@@ n@@ p , n@@ p , or untreated , which all survi@@ ve@@ d. proteinuria appeared in all series , but was 2 @-@ 5 times more intense ( p &gt; 0.001 ) and prolonged after doxorubicin treatment ( 400 @-@ 700 mg / day ) , without significant difference between d@@ x@@ n@@ p and d@@ x@@ . rats treated by un@@ loaded n@@ p behaved as contro@@ l@@ s. these results demonstrate that , in these experimental conditions , d@@ x@@ n@@ p killed less animals than free d@@ x , despite of an enhanced renal toxicity of the form@@ er@@ . both effects ( better survival and neph@@ rosis ) are most probably related to an enhanced capture of d@@ x@@ n@@ p by cells of the mononuclear phagocyte system , including mesangial cells .
etoposide @-@ related myocardial infarc@@ tion@@ . the occurrence of a myocardial infarction is reported after chemotherapy containing etoposide , in a man with no risk factors for coronary heart dise@@ as@@ e. possible causal mechanisms are discussed .
subjective assessment of sexual dysfunction of patients on long @-@ term administration of dig@@ ox@@ in@@ . various data suggest that male patients who have received digoxin on a long@@ term basis have increased levels of serum estrogen and decreased levels of plasma testosterone and luteinizing hormone ( l@@ h ) . this study was undertaken to investigate the links between the long @-@ term administration of digoxin therapy and sexual behavior , and the effect of digoxin on plasma levels of estradiol , testosterone , and l@@ h@@ . the patients of the study and control group ( without digoxin ) were of similar cardiac functional capacity and age ( 25 @-@ 40 years ) and were randomly selected from the rheumatic heart disease patient@@ s. a subjective assessment of sexual behavior in the study and control groups was carried out , using parameters such as sexual desire , sexual excit@@ ement , and frequency of sexual relati@@ on@@ s. personal interviews and a questionnaire were also used for the evaluation of sexual behavi@@ or@@ . the findings support the reports concerning digoxin effect on plasma estradiol , testosterone , and l@@ h@@ . the differences in the means were signific@@ ant@@ . tests used to evaluate the changes in sexual behavior showed a significant decrease in sexual desire , sexual excit@@ ement phase ( erection ) , and frequency of sexual relations in the study group .
fatal aplastic anemia due to in@@ dometh@@ acin@@ --@@ lymphocyte transformation tests in vit@@ ro@@ . although indomethacin has been implicated as a possible cause of aplastic anemia on the basis of a few clinical observations , its role has not been definitely establ@@ is@@ he@@ d. a case of fatal aplastic anemia is described in which no drugs other than allopurinol and indomethacin were gi@@ ven@@ . indomethacin was first given four weeks prior to the onset of symptom@@ s. a positive lymphocyte transformation test with indomethacin in vitro further substanti@@ ates the potential role of this drug in causing aplastic anemia in a susceptible patient@@ . fortunately , this seems to be a very rare complication .
plasma and urinary lipids and lipoproteins during the development of nephrotic syndrome induced in the rat by puromycin amin@@ onucle@@ osi@@ de@@ . this study was undertaken to ascertain whether the alterations of plasma lipoproteins found in nephrotic syndrome induced by puromycin amin@@ onucle@@ oside were due to nephrotic syndrome per se , or , at least in part , to the amin@@ onucle@@ osi@@ de@@ . the purpose of the present study was to investigate the changes in plasma and urinary lipoproteins during the administration of puromycin amin@@ onucle@@ oside ( 20 mg / kg for 7 days ) and the subsequent development of nephrotic syn@@ dro@@ me@@ . since massive albuminuria occurred after 6 days of treatment , the time @-@ course study was divided into two stages : pre @-@ nephrotic stage ( day 1 @-@ 5 ) and nephrotic stage ( day 6 @-@ 11 ) . in pre @-@ nephrotic stage the plasma level of fatty acids , triacylglycerol and v@@ l@@ dl decreased while that of phospholipid , cholesteryl esters and h@@ dl remained const@@ ant@@ . plasma apolipoprotein a @-@ i tended to increase ( 40 % increase at day 5 ) . at the beginning of nephrotic stage ( day 6 ) the concentration of plasma albumin dropped to a very low level , while that of apolipoprotein a @-@ i increased abruptly ( 4 @-@ fold increase ) and continued to rise , although less steep@@ ly , in the following day@@ s. the plasma concentration of h@@ dl followed the same pattern@@ . plasma v@@ l@@ dl and l@@ dl increased at a later stage ( day 9 ) . plasma apolipoprotein a @-@ i was found not only in h@@ dl ( 1.0@@ 63 @-@ 1.@@ 210 g / ml ) but also in the l@@ dl density class ( 1.0@@ 25 @-@ 1.0@@ 50 g / ml ) . in the pre @-@ nephrotic stage lipo@@ proteinuria was negligible , while in the early nephrotic stage the urinary loss of plasma lipoproteins consisted mainly of h@@ dl@@ . these observations indicate that puromycin amin@@ onucle@@ oside alters plasma lipoproteins by lowering v@@ l@@ dl and increasing h@@ dl@@ . it is likely that the early and striking increase of plasma h@@ dl found in nephrotic rats is related to a direct effect of the drug on h@@ dl metabolism .
circulating lysosomal enzymes and acute hepatic necro@@ si@@ s. the activities of the lysosomal enzymes acid and neutral protease , n @-@ acetyl@@ glucosaminidase , and acid phosphatase were measured in the serum of patients with fulminant hepatic fail@@ ure@@ . acid protease ( cathepsin d ) activity was increased about ten@@ fold in patients who died and nearly fourfold in those who survived fulminant hepatic failure after paracetamol overdose , whereas activities were increased equally in patients with fulminant hepatic failure due to viral hepatitis whether or not they survi@@ ve@@ d. a correlation was found between serum acid protease activity and prothrombin time , and the increase in cathepsin d activity was sustained over several days compared with aspartate aminotransferase , which showed a sharp early peak and then a fall@@ . circulating lysosomal proteases can damage other organs , and measurement of their activity may therefore be of added value in assessing prognosis in this condition .
trans@@ ket@@ ol@@ ase abnormality in tol@@ az@@ amide @-@ induced w@@ er@@ nic@@ ke &apos;s encephal@@ opath@@ y@@ . we studied a thiamine @-@ dependent enzyme , trans@@ ket@@ ol@@ ase , from fibroblasts of a diabetic patient who developed w@@ er@@ nic@@ ke &apos;s encephalopathy when treated with tol@@ az@@ amide , in order to delineate if this patient also had trans@@ ket@@ ol@@ ase abnormality &#91; high km for thiamine pyrophosphate ( t@@ pp ) &#93; , as previously reported in post@@ alcoholic w@@ er@@ nic@@ ke @-@ k@@ or@@ s@@ ak@@ off syn@@ dro@@ me@@ . in addition to this patient , we also studied this enzyme from three diabetic kin@@ dre@@ ds without any history of w@@ er@@ nic@@ ke &apos;s encephalopathy and from four normal contro@@ l@@ s. we found that the above @-@ mentioned patient and one of the diabetic kin@@ dre@@ ds with no history of w@@ er@@ nic@@ ke &apos;s encephalopathy had abnormal trans@@ ket@@ ol@@ ase as determined by its km for t@@ pp@@ . these data suggest a similarity between post@@ alcoholic w@@ er@@ nic@@ ke @-@ k@@ or@@ s@@ ak@@ off syndrome and the patient with tol@@ az@@ amide @-@ induced w@@ er@@ nic@@ ke &apos;s encephalopathy from the standpoint of trans@@ ket@@ ol@@ ase abnormality .
mechanisms of myocardial ischemia induced by epinephrine : comparison with exercise @-@ induced ischem@@ i@@ a. the role of epinephrine in eliciting myocardial ischemia was examined in patients with coronary artery dise@@ as@@ e. objective signs of ischemia and factors increasing myocardial oxygen consumption were compared during epinephrine infusion and supine bicycle exerc@@ is@@ e. both epinephrine and exercise produced myocardial ischemia as evidenced by st segment depression and ang@@ in@@ a. however , the mechanisms of myocardial ischemia induced by epinephrine were significantly different from those of exerc@@ is@@ e. exercise @-@ induced myocardial ischemia was marked predominantly by increased heart rate and rate @-@ pressure product with a minor contribution of end @-@ diastolic volume , while epinephrine @-@ induced ischemia was characterized by a marked increase in contractility and a less pronounced increase in heart rate and rate @-@ pressure produc@@ t. these findings indicate that ischemia produced by epinephrine , as may occur during states of emotional distress , has a mechanism distinct from that due to physical exertion .
transient contralateral rotation following unilateral substantia nigra lesion reflects susceptibility of the nigrostriatal system to exhaustion by amph@@ et@@ amin@@ e. following unilateral 6 @-@ oh@@ da induced sn lesion , a transient period of contralateral rotation has been reported to precede the predominant ipsilateral cir@@ cl@@ ing@@ . in order to clarify the nature of this initial contralateral rotation we examined the effect of the duration of recovery period after the lesion , on amphetamine @-@ induced rotational behavi@@ or@@ . three days post lesion , most rats cir@@ cled predominantly contral@@ aterally to the le@@ sion@@ . such contralateral rotation may result from either degeneration @-@ induced breakdown of the da pool , or lesion @-@ induced increase of da turnover in the spared neuron@@ s. a substantial degree of contralateral preference was still evident when amphetamine was administered for the first time 24 days after le@@ sioning , indicating involvement of spared cells in the contralateral rot@@ ation@@ . however , regardless of the duration of recovery ( and irrespective of either lesion volume , amphetamine dose , or post @-@ lesion motor exercise ) , amphetamine @-@ induced rotation tended to become gradually more ipsilateral as the observation session progressed , and all rats cir@@ cled ipsi@@ laterally to the lesion in response to further amphetamine injec@@ tion@@ s. these findings suggest that amphetamine has an irreversible effect on the post @-@ lesion da pool contributing to contralateral rotation .
thyroid function and urine @-@ concentrating ability during lithium treat@@ ment@@ . it has been suggested that adenylate cyclase inhibition may be important in the development of both nephro@@ genic diabetes insipidus and hypothyroidism during lithium treat@@ ment@@ . we measured serum thyroxine and urine @-@ concentrating ability ( um@@ ax ) in response to desm@@ opressin ( dd@@ av@@ p ) in 85 patients receiving lithi@@ um@@ . hypothyroidism developed in eight patients while they were taking lithi@@ um@@ . impaired um@@ ax was found in both euthyroid and hypothyroid patients while some hypothyroid patients concentrated their urine well@@ . it is concluded that the dominant mechanisms by which lithium exerts these two effects are different .
sensitivity of erythroid progenitor colonies to erythropoietin in az@@ id@@ oth@@ ym@@ idine treated immunodeficient mic@@ e. the anaemia induced by 3 &apos; -@@ azido @-@ 3&apos;@@ di@@ deoxy@@ thymidine ( az@@ t ) is poorly underst@@ o@@ od@@ . we have used a murine model of aids , infection of female c@@ 57@@ b@@ l / 6 mice with l@@ p @-@ b@@ m@@ 5 murine leukaemia ( mul@@ v ) virus , to determine if az@@ t @-@ induced anaemia is due , in part , to decreased responsiveness of erythropo@@ ietic precursors ( b@@ f@@ u @-@ e ) to erythropoietin ( ep@@ o ) . mice in the early stage of l@@ p @-@ b@@ m@@ 5 mul@@ v disease were given az@@ t in their drinking water at 1.0 and 2.5 mg / m@@ l@@ . az@@ t produced anaemia in both groups , in a dose @-@ dependent fash@@ ion@@ . despite the anaemia , the number of splenic and bone marrow b@@ f@@ u @-@ e in az@@ t treated mice increased up to five @-@ fold over levels observed in infected untreated animals after 15 d of treat@@ ment@@ . colony formation by splenic and bone marrow b@@ fu@@ e was stimulated at lower concentrations of ep@@ o in mice receiving az@@ t for 15 d than for infected , untreated mic@@ e. by day 30 , sensitivity of both splenic and bone marrow b@@ f@@ u @-@ e of treated animals returned to that observed from cells of infected untreated anim@@ al@@ s. the mean plasma levels of ep@@ o observed in az@@ t treated mice were appropriate for the degree of anaemia observed when compared with phenyl@@ hydrazine ( ph@@ z ) treated mic@@ e. the numbers of b@@ f@@ u @-@ e and the percentage of bone marrow erythro@@ blasts observed were comparable in az@@ t and ph@@ z treated mice with similar degrees of ana@@ em@@ i@@ a. however , reticul@@ ocytosis was inappropriate for the degree of anaemia observed in az@@ t treated infected mic@@ e. az@@ t @-@ induced peripheral anaemia in the face of increased numbers of b@@ f@@ u @-@ e and increased levels of plasma ep@@ o suggest a lesion in terminal differentiation .
detection of abnormal cardiac adrenergic neuron activity in adriamycin @-@ induced cardiomyopathy with iodine @-@ 125 @-@ met@@ ai@@ od@@ obenz@@ yl@@ guanid@@ ine@@ . radiolabeled met@@ ai@@ od@@ obenz@@ yl@@ guanidine ( m@@ ib@@ g ) , an analog of norepinephrine ( ne ) , serves as an index of adrenergic neuron integrity and function@@ . using a rat model of adriamycin @-@ induced cardiomyopathy , we tested the hypothesis that abnormal cardiac adrenergic neuron activity may appear and be exacerbated dose @-@ dependently in adriamycin cardiomy@@ opath@@ y@@ . the degree of vacuolar degeneration of myocardial cells was analyzed in relation to the duration of adriamycin treatment ( 2 mg / kg , once a week ) . there were no abnormalities or only isolated degeneration in the 1- or 2 @-@ wk treatment groups , isolated or scattered degeneration in half of the 3 @-@ wk group , frequent scattered degeneration in the 4 @-@ wk group , scattered or focal degeneration in the 5 @-@ wk group , and extensive degeneration in the 8 @-@ wk grou@@ p. myocardial accumulation of &#91; 125@@ i &#93; m@@ ib@@ g 4 hr after intravenous injection did not differ between the controls and the groups treated 3 wk or less@@ . however , the 4 @-@ wk group had a slightly lower accumulation in the right ventricular wall ( 82 % of the control ) and significantly lower accumulation in the left ventricular wall ( about 66 % of the control : p less than 0.05 ) . in the 5 @-@ wk group , m@@ ib@@ g accumulation in the right and left ventricular wall was 35 % and 27 % of that in controls , respectively ( p less than 0.001 ) . in the 8 @-@ wk group , m@@ ib@@ g accumulation in the right and left ventricular wall was 18 % and 14 % of that in controls , respectively ( p less than 0.001 ) . thus , m@@ ib@@ g accumulation in the myocardium decreased in an adriamycin dose @-@ dependent man@@ ner@@ . the appearance of impaired cardiac adrenergic neuron activity in the presence of slight myocardial impairment ( scattered or focal vacuolar degeneration ) indicates that m@@ ib@@ g scintigraphy may be a useful method for detection of adriamycin @-@ induced cardiomyopathy .
am@@ nestic syndrome associated with propranolol toxicity : a case repor@@ t. an elderly woman developed an al@@ z@@ heimer @-@ like subacute dementia as a result of propranolol toxic@@ it@@ y@@ . analysis of the manifestations showed that severe impairment of memory accounted for virtually all of the abnormal@@ iti@@ es@@ . there is evidence that cerebral reactions to drug toxicity can exhibit patterns that suggest highly selective involvement of functional subdivisions of the brain .
biphasic response of the sa node of the dog heart in vivo to selective administration of ket@@ amin@@ e. effect of ketamine on the sa node of the dog heart was studied in vivo using a selective perfusion technique of the sa node arter@@ y@@ . injections of ketamine in doses from 100 microgram to 3 mg into the artery produced a depression of the sa nodal activity by a direct action@@ . this depression was followed by the sudden appearance of a stimulatory ph@@ as@@ e. bilateral vagotomy and sympathectomy or prior administration of a ganglion blocker failed to inhibit the occurrence of the ketamine @-@ induced tachycardia , while it was completely abolished in the reser@@ pin@@ ized dogs or by a prior injection of a beta @-@ blocking agent into the sa node arter@@ y@@ . this may indicate that an activation of the peripheral adrenergic mechanism plays an important role in the induction of the excitatory effect of ketamine injected in the sa node artery .
the use of serum cholinesterase in succin@@ ylcholine ap@@ no@@ e@@ a. fifteen patients demonstrating unexpected prolonged apnoea lasting several hours after succin@@ ylcholine have been treated by a new preparation of human serum cholin@@ ester@@ as@@ e. adequate spontaneous respiration was re @-@ established in an average period of ten minutes after the injec@@ tion@@ . in 12 patients biochemical genetic examinations confirmed the presence of an atypical serum cholin@@ ester@@ as@@ e. in three patients none of the usual variants were found@@ . it is therefore supposed that other unknown variants of serum cholinesterase exist which cannot hydrolyze succin@@ yl@@ chol@@ ine@@ . the use of serum cholinesterase in succin@@ ylcholine apnoea provided considerable relief to both patient and anaesthe@@ tist .
orthostatic hypotension occurs following alpha 2 @-@ adrenoceptor blockade in chronic prazosin @-@ pretreated conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats . 1@@ . studies were performed to evaluate whether chronic prazosin treatment alters the alpha 2 @-@ adrenoceptor function for orthostatic control of arterial blood pressure in conscious spontaneously hypertensive rats ( sh@@ r ) . 2. conscious sh@@ r ( male 300 @-@ 350 g ) were subjected to 90 degrees head @-@ up til@@ ts for 60 s following acute administration of prazosin ( 0.1 mg kg @-@ 1 i.p. ) or ra@@ u@@ wol@@ sc@@ ine ( 3 mg kg @-@ 1 i.v. ) . orthostatic hypotension was determined by the average decrease ( % ) in mean arterial pressure ( map femoral ) over the 60 @-@ s tilt period@@ . the basal map of conscious sh@@ r was reduced to a similar extent by prazosin ( -@@ 23 % ( - ) -@@ 26 % map ) and ra@@ u@@ wol@@ sc@@ ine ( -@@ 16 % ( - ) -@@ 33 % map ) . however , the head @-@ up tilt induced orthostatic hypotension in the sh@@ r treated with prazosin ( -@@ 16 % map , n = 6 ) , but not in the sh@@ r treated with ra@@ u@@ wol@@ sc@@ ine ( less than + 2 % map , n = 6 ) . 3. conscious sh@@ r were treated for 4 days with prazosin at 2 mg kg @-@ 1 day @-@ 1 i.p. for chronic alpha 1 @-@ adrenoceptor bloc@@ k@@ ade@@ . map in conscious sh@@ r after chronic prazosin treatment was 14 % lower than in the untreated sh@@ r ( n = 8 ) . head @-@ up til@@ ts in these rats did not produce orthostatic hypotension when performed either prior to or after acute dosing of prazosin ( 0.1 mg kg @-@ 1 i.p. ) . conversely , administration of ra@@ u@@ wol@@ sc@@ ine ( 3 mg kg @-@ 1 i.v. ) in chronic prazosin treated sh@@ r decreased the basal map by 12 @-@ 31 % ( n = 4 ) , and subsequent til@@ ts induced further drops of map by 19 @-@ 23 % in these rats . 4@@ . the pressor responses and bradycardia to the alpha 1 @-@ agonist cir@@ azoline ( 0.6 and 2 micrograms kg @-@ 1 i.v. ) , the alpha 2 @-@ agonist ab@@ bot@@ t @-@ 5@@ 36@@ 93 ( 1 and 3 micrograms kg @-@ 1 i.v. ) , and noradrenaline ( 0.1 and 1.0 micrograms kg @-@ 1 i.v. ) were determined in conscious sh@@ r with and without chronic prazosin pre@@ treat@@ ment@@ . both the pressor and bradycardia effects of cir@@ azoline were abolished in chronic prazosin treated sh@@ r ( n = 4 ) as compared to the untreated sh@@ r ( n = 4 ) . on the other hand , the pressor effects of ab@@ bot@@ t @-@ 5@@ 36@@ 93 were similar in both groups of sh@@ r , but the accompanying bradycardia was greater in sh@@ r with chronic prazosin treatment than without such treat@@ ment@@ . furthermore , the bradycardia that accompanied the noradrenaline @-@ induced pressor effect in sh@@ r was similar with and without chronic prazosin treatment despite a 47 @-@ 71 % reduction of the pressor effect in chronic alpha 1 @-@ receptor blocked sh@@ r .

systemic toxicity and resuscitation in bup@@ ivac@@ ain@@ e- , lev@@ ob@@ up@@ ivac@@ ain@@ e- , or ropivacaine @-@ infused rat@@ s. we compared the systemic toxicity of bupivacaine , lev@@ ob@@ up@@ ivacaine , and ropivacaine in anesthetized rat@@ s. we also compared the ability to resuscit@@ ate rats after lethal doses of these local anesthe@@ tic@@ s. bupivacaine , lev@@ ob@@ up@@ ivacaine , or ropivacaine was infused at a rate of 2 m@@ g. kg ( -1 ) . min ( -1 ) while electrocardiogram , electroencephalogram , and arterial pressure were continuously monit@@ ore@@ d. when as@@ yst@@ ole was recorded , drug infusion was stopped and a resuscitation sequence was beg@@ un@@ . epinephrine 0.01 mg / kg was administered at 1 @-@ min intervals while external cardiac com@@ pressions were appli@@ ed@@ . resuscitation was considered successful when a systolic arterial pressure &gt; or = 100 mm h@@ g was achieved within 5 min@@ . the cumulative doses of lev@@ ob@@ up@@ ivacaine and ropivacaine that produced seizures were similar and were larger than those of bup@@ ivac@@ ain@@ e. the cumulative doses of lev@@ ob@@ up@@ ivacaine that produced dys@@ rhyth@@ mias and as@@ yst@@ ole were smaller than the corresponding doses of ropivacaine , but they were larger than those of bup@@ ivac@@ ain@@ e. the number of successful res@@ usc@@ itations did not differ among grou@@ ps@@ . however , a smaller dose of epinephrine was required in the ropivacaine group than in the other grou@@ ps@@ . we conclude that the systemic toxicity of lev@@ ob@@ up@@ ivacaine is intermediate between that of ropivacaine and bupivacaine when administered at the same rate and that ropivacaine @-@ induced cardiac arrest appears to be more susceptible to treatment than that induced by bupivacaine or lev@@ ob@@ up@@ ivacaine .
22 @-@ ox@@ ac@@ al@@ cit@@ riol suppresses secondary hyperparathyroidism without inducing low bone turnover in dogs with renal fail@@ ure@@ . background : calcitriol therapy suppresses serum levels of parathyroid hormone ( p@@ th ) in patients with renal failure but has several drawbacks , including hypercalcemia and / or marked suppression of bone turnover , which may lead to ad@@ ynamic bone dise@@ as@@ e. a new vitamin d analogue , 22 @-@ ox@@ ac@@ al@@ cit@@ riol ( oc@@ t ) , has been shown to have promising characteris@@ tic@@ s. this study was undertaken to determine the effects of oc@@ t on serum p@@ th levels and bone turnover in states of normal or impaired renal function@@ . methods : sixty dogs were either neph@@ rectomized ( n@@ x , n = 38 ) or sham @-@ operated ( sham , n = 22 ) . the animals received supplemental phosphate to enhance p@@ th secre@@ tion@@ . fourteen weeks after the start of phosphate supplementation , half of the n@@ x and sham dogs received doses of oc@@ t ( three times per week ) ; the other half were given vehicle for 60 week@@ s. thereafter , the treatment modalities for a subset of animals were crossed over for an additional eight mon@@ th@@ s. biochemical and hormonal indices of calcium and bone metabolism were measured throughout the study , and bone biopsies were done at baseline , 60 weeks after oc@@ t or vehicle treatment , and at the end of the crossover period@@ . results : in n@@ x dogs , oc@@ t significantly decreased serum p@@ th levels soon after the induction of renal insuffici@@ enc@@ y@@ . in long @-@ standing secondary hyperparathyroidism , oc@@ t ( 0.03 microg / kg ) stabilized serum p@@ th levels during the first mon@@ th@@ s. serum p@@ th levels rose thereafter , but the rise was less pronounced compared with baseline than the rise seen in n@@ x contro@@ l@@ . these effects were accompanied by episodes of hypercalcemia and hyper@@ phosphat@@ em@@ i@@ a. in animals with normal renal function , oc@@ t induced a transient decrease in serum p@@ th levels at a dose of 0.1 microg / kg , which was not sustained with lowering of the dos@@ es@@ . in n@@ x dogs , oc@@ t reversed abnormal bone formation , such as woven osteoid and fibrosis , but did not significantly alter the level of bone tur@@ no@@ ver@@ . in addition , oc@@ t improved mineralization lag time , ( that is , the rate at which osteoid miner@@ alizes ) in both n@@ x and sham dog@@ s. conclusions : these results indicate that even though oc@@ t does not completely prevent the occurrence of hypercalcemia in experimental dogs with renal insufficiency , it may be of use in the management of secondary hyperparathyroidism because it does not induce low bone turnover and , therefore , does not increase the risk of ad@@ ynamic bone disease .
chemotherapy of advanced inoperable non @-@ small cell lung cancer with paclitaxel : a phase ii tri@@ al@@ . paclitaxel ( taxol ; bri@@ st@@ ol @-@ my@@ ers squ@@ ib@@ b company , princ@@ eton , n@@ j ) has demonstrated significant antineoplastic activity against different tumor types , notably ovarian and breast carcin@@ om@@ a. two phase ii trials of 24 @-@ hour paclitaxel infusions in chemotherapy @-@ naive patients with stage i@@ i@@ ib or iv non @-@ small cell lung cancer ( ns@@ cl@@ c ) reported response rates of 21 % and 24 % . leukopenia was dose limiting : as many as 62.5 % of patients experienced grade 4 leuk@@ open@@ i@@ a. we investigated the efficacy and toxicity of a 3 @-@ hour paclitaxel infusion in a phase ii trial in patients with inoperable stage i@@ i@@ ib or iv ns@@ cl@@ c. the 58 patients treated ( 41 men and 17 women ) had a median age of 59 years ( age range , 25 to 75 ) and a performance status of 0 through 2. most patients ( 7@@ 2.4 % ) had stage iv ns@@ cl@@ c. paclitaxel 225 mg / m2 was infused over 3 hours every 3 weeks with standard prophylactic pre@@ medic@@ ation@@ . of 50 patients evaluable for response , 12 ( 24 % ) had partial remission , 26 ( 52 % ) had no change , and 12 had disease progression ( 24 % ) . hematologic toxicities were mild : only one patient ( 2 % ) developed grade 3 or 4 neutropenia , while 29 % had grade 1 or 2. grade 1 or 2 polyneuropathy affected 56 % of patients while only one ( 2 % ) experienced severe poly@@ neuro@@ path@@ y@@ . similarly , grade 1 or 2 myalgia / arthralgia was observed in 6@@ 3.2 % of patients , but only 14.3 % experienced grade 3 or 4@@ . nausea and vomiting were infrequent , with 14 % of patients experiencing grade 1 or 2 and only 2 % experiencing grade 3 or 4@@ . paclitaxel is thus an active single agent in this patient population , with a 3 @-@ hour infusion proving comparably effective to a 24 @-@ hour infusion and superior in terms of the incidence of hematologic and non@@ hematologic toxic@@ it@@ y@@ . further phase ii studies with paclitaxel combined with other drugs active against ns@@ cl@@ c are indicated , and phase iii studies comparing paclitaxel with standard chemotherapy remain to be completed .
cerebral hemorrhage associated with phenyl@@ propan@@ olamine in combination with caffe@@ ine@@ . phenyl@@ propan@@ olamine ( pp@@ a ) is a drug that has been associated with serious side effects including stro@@ ke@@ . it is often combined with caffeine in diet preparations and &quot; look @-@ alike &quot; pill@@ s. in order to determine if pp@@ a / caffeine can lead to stroke in normotensive and / or hypertensive rats , we administered the combination in six times the allowed human dose calculated on a per weight basis for the rats two times per day for five day@@ s. subarachnoid and cerebral hemorrhage was noted in 18 % of the hypertensive rat@@ s. a single pp@@ a / caffeine administration ( same dose ) lead to acute hypertension in both the normotensive and hypertensive anim@@ al@@ s. these results suggest that pp@@ a / caffeine can lead to cerebral hemorrhage in previously hypertensive animals when administered in greater than the allowed dos@@ ag@@ e. an acute elevation in blood pressure may be a contributing factor .
long @-@ term efficacy and toxicity of high @-@ dose amiodarone therapy for ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrill@@ ation@@ . amiodarone was administered to 154 patients who had sustained , symptomatic ventricular tachycardia ( v@@ t ) ( n = 118 ) or a cardiac arrest ( n = 36 ) and who were refractory to conventional antiarrhythmic dru@@ g@@ s. the loading dose was 800 mg / day for 6 weeks and the maintenance dose was 600 mg / day@@ . sixty @-@ nine percent of patients continued treatment with amiodarone and had no recurrence of symptomatic v@@ t or ventricular fibrillation ( v@@ f ) over a follow @-@ up of 6 to 52 months ( mean + / - standard deviation 14.2 + / - 8.2 ) . six percent of the patients had a nonfatal recurrence of v@@ t and were successfully managed by continuing amiodarone at a higher dose or by the addition of a conventional antiarrhythmic dru@@ g. one or more adverse drug reactions occurred in 51 % of patient@@ s. adverse effects forced a reduction in the dose of amiodarone in 41 % and discontinuation of amiodarone in 10 % of patient@@ s. the most common symptomatic adverse reactions were tremor or ataxia ( 35 % ) , nausea and anorexia ( 8 % ) , visual hal@@ os or blur@@ ring ( 6 % ) , thyroid function abnormalities ( 6 % ) and pulmonary interstitial infiltrates ( 5 % ) . although large @-@ dose amiodarone is highly effective in the long @-@ term treatment of v@@ t or v@@ f refractory to conventional antiarrhythmic drugs , it causes significant toxicity in approximately 50 % of patient@@ s. however , when the dose is adjusted based on clinical response or the development of adverse effects , 75 % of patients with v@@ t or v@@ f can be successfully managed with amiodarone .
effect of calcium chloride and 4 @-@ aminopyridine therapy on desipramine toxicity in rat@@ s. background : hypotension is a major contributor to mortality in tricyclic antidepressant over@@ dos@@ e. recent data suggest that tricyclic antidepressants inhibit calcium influx in some tissu@@ es@@ . this study addressed the potential role of calcium channel blockade in tricyclic antidepressant @-@ induced hypot@@ en@@ sion@@ . methods : two interventions were studied that have been shown previously to improve blood pressure with calcium channel blocker over@@ dos@@ e. c@@ ac@@ l@@ 2 and 4 @-@ aminopyr@@ idine@@ . anesthetized rats received the tricyclic antidepressant desipramine ip to produce hypotension , q@@ rs prolongation , and brady@@ cardi@@ a. fifteen min later , animals received c@@ ac@@ l@@ 2 , na@@ h@@ co@@ 3 , or sal@@ ine@@ . in a second experiment , rats received tricyclic antidepressant desipramine ip followed in 15 min by 4 @-@ aminopyridine or sal@@ ine@@ . results : na@@ h@@ co@@ 3 briefly ( 5 min ) reversed hypotension and q@@ rs prolong@@ ation@@ . c@@ ac@@ l@@ 2 and 4 @-@ aminopyridine failed to improve blood pres@@ su@@ re@@ . the incidence of ventricular arrhythmias ( p = 0.004 ) and seizures ( p = 0.03 ) in the c@@ ac@@ l@@ 2 group was higher than the other grou@@ ps@@ . conclusion : the administration of c@@ ac@@ l@@ 2 or 4 @-@ aminopyridine did not reverse tricyclic antidepressant @-@ induced hypotension in rat@@ s. c@@ ac@@ l@@ 2 therapy may possibly worsen both cardiovascular and central nervous system toxic@@ it@@ y@@ . these findings do not support a role for calcium channel inhibition in the pathogenesis of tricyclic antidepressant @-@ induced hypotension .
phase i trial of 13 @-@ cis @-@ retinoic acid in children with neuroblastoma following bone marrow transpl@@ ant@@ ation@@ . purpose : treatment of neuroblastoma cell lines with 13 @-@ cis @-@ retinoic acid ( cis @-@ ra ) can cause sustained inhibition of prolifer@@ ation@@ . since cis @-@ ra has demonstrated clinical responses in neuroblastoma patients , it may be effective in preventing relapse after cytotoxic therap@@ y@@ . this phase i trial was designed to determine the maximal @-@ tolerated dosage ( mt@@ d ) , toxicities , and pharmacokinetics of cis @-@ ra administered on an intermittent schedule in children with neuroblastoma following bone marrow transplantation ( b@@ mt ) . patients and methods : fifty @-@ one assess@@ able patients , 2 to 12 years of age , were treated with oral cis @-@ ra administered in two equally divided doses daily for 2 weeks , followed by a 2 @-@ week rest period , for up to 12 cour@@ ses@@ . the dose was escal@@ ated from 100 to 200 mg / m2 / d until dose @-@ limiting toxicity ( d@@ lt ) was obser@@ ve@@ d. a single intrap@@ ati@@ ent dose escalation was per@@ mit@@ te@@ d. results : the mt@@ d of cis @-@ ra was 160 mg / m2 / d. dose @-@ limiting toxicities in six of nine patients at 200 mg / m2 / d included hypercalcemia ( n = 3 ) , rash ( n = 2 ) , and anemia / thrombocytopenia / emesis / rash ( n = 1 ) . all toxicities resolved after cis @-@ ra was discontinu@@ ed@@ . three complete responses were observed in marrow metast@@ as@@ es@@ . serum levels of 7.4 + / - 3.0 mumol / l ( peak ) and 4.0 + / - 2.8 mumol / l ( trough ) at the mt@@ d were maintained during 14 days of therap@@ y@@ . the d@@ lt correlated with serum levels &gt; or = 10 mumol / l@@ . conclusion : the mt@@ d of cis @-@ ra given on this intermittent schedule was 160 mg / m2 / d. serum levels known to be effective against neuroblastoma in vitro were achieved at this dos@@ e. the d@@ lt included hypercalcemia , and may be predicted by serum cis @-@ ra lev@@ el@@ s. monitoring of serum calcium and cis @-@ ra levels is indicated in future trials .
effect of calcium chloride on gross behavioural changes produced by carbachol and es@@ erine in cat@@ s. the effect of calcium chloride injected into the cerebral ventricles of group @-@ housed un@@ anaesthetized cats upon voc@@ alization ( r@@ age , his@@ sing and s@@ nar@@ ling ) , fighting ( attack with pa@@ ws and cl@@ aws , defense with pa@@ ws and cl@@ aws and biting ) , my@@ dri@@ asis , tremor and clonic @-@ tonic convulsions produced by carbachol and es@@ erine injected similarly was investig@@ ated@@ . calcium chloride depressed or almost completely abolished the voc@@ alization and fighting due to carbachol and es@@ er@@ ine@@ . on the other hand , my@@ dri@@ asis , tremor and clonic @-@ tonic convulsions evoked by carbachol and es@@ erine were not significantly changed by calcium chlor@@ ide@@ . it is apparent that calcium chloride can &quot; dissociate &quot; voc@@ alization and fighting from autonomic and motor phenomena such as my@@ dri@@ asis , tremor and clonic @-@ tonic convulsions caused by carbachol and es@@ er@@ ine@@ . calcium chloride inhibited the voc@@ alization and fighting produced by carbachol and es@@ erine most probably by a nonspecific stabilizing action on central muscarinic chol@@ inoc@@ eptive sit@@ es@@ . these results further support the view that calcium ions in excess have an atropine @-@ like action also in the central nervous system .
multiple side effects of penicillamine therapy in one patient with rheumatoid arth@@ ri@@ tis@@ . skin r@@ ashes , proteinuria , systemic lupus erythematosus , polymy@@ ositis and myasthenia gravis have all been recorded as complications of penicillamine therapy in patients with rheumatoid arth@@ ri@@ tis@@ . a patient who had developed all 5 is now describ@@ ed@@ . the skin lesion resembled elast@@ osis perfor@@ ans ser@@ pig@@ in@@ osa , which has been reported as a rare side effect in patients with wil@@ son &apos;s disease but not in patients with rheumatoid arthritis treated with penicillamine .
electrocardiographic changes and cardiac arrhythmias in patients receiving psychotropic dru@@ g@@ s. eight patients had cardiac manifestations that were life @-@ threatening in five while taking psychotropic drugs , either phenothi@@ azines or tricyclic antidepress@@ ant@@ s. although most patients were receiving several drugs , mell@@ ari@@ l ( thi@@ or@@ id@@ azine ) appeared to be responsible for five cases of ventricular tachycardia , one of which was fatal in a 35 year old wom@@ an@@ . supraventricular tachycardia developed in one patient receiving thor@@ azine ( chlorpromazine ) . av@@ ent@@ yl ( nor@@ trip@@ tyline ) and el@@ avi@@ l ( amitriptyline ) each produced left bundle branch block in a 73 year old wom@@ an@@ . electrocardiographic t and u wave abnormalities were present in most patient@@ s. the ventricular arrhythmias responded to intravenous administration of lidocaine and to direct current electric shock ; ventricular pacing was required in some instances and intravenous administration of propranolol combined with ventricular pacing in on@@ e. the tachyarrhythmias generally subsided within 48 hours after administration of the drugs was stop@@ ped@@ . five of the eight patients were 50 years of age or younger ; only one clearly had antecedent heart dise@@ as@@ e. major cardiac arrhythmias are a potential hazard in patients without heart disease who are receiving custom@@ ary therapeutic doses of psychotropic dru@@ g@@ s. a prospective clinical trial is suggested to quantify the risk of cardiac complications to patients receiving phenothi@@ azines or tricyclic antidepressant drugs .

sustained clinical improvement of a patient with decompensated hepatitis b virus @-@ related cirrhosis after treatment with lamivudine mono@@ therap@@ y@@ . hepatitis b virus ( h@@ b@@ v ) infection , which causes liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma , remains a major health problem in asian coun@@ tri@@ es@@ . recent development of vaccine for prevention is reported to be successful in reducing the size of chronically infected carriers , although the standard medical therapies have not been established up to n@@ ow@@ . in this report , we encountered a patient with decompensated h@@ b@@ v @-@ related cirrhosis who exhibited the dramatic improvements after antiviral therap@@ y@@ . the patient was a 50 @-@ year @-@ old wom@@ an@@ . previous conventional medical treatments were not effective for this patient , thus this patient had been referred to our hospit@@ al@@ . however , the administration of lamivudine , a reverse transcriptase inhibitor , for 23 months dramatically improved her liver sever@@ it@@ y@@ . during this period , no drug resistant mutant h@@ b@@ v emerged , and the serum h@@ b@@ v @-@ d@@ na level was continuously sup@@ pres@@ sed@@ . these virological responses were also maintained even after the antiviral therapy was discontinu@@ ed@@ . moreover , both hepatitis b surface antigen and e antigen were observed to have disappeared in this patient@@ . the administration of lamivudine to patients with h@@ b@@ v @-@ related cirrhosis , like our present case , should be considered as an initial medical therapeutic option , especially in countries where liver transplantation is not reliably available .
dual effects of melatonin on barbit@@ urate @-@ induced nar@@ cosis in rat@@ s. melatonin affects the circadian sleep / wake cycle , but it is not clear whether it may influence drug @-@ induced narco@@ si@@ s. sodium thi@@ open@@ thal was administered intraperitoneally into male rats pre @-@ treated with melatonin ( 0.05 , 0.5 , 5 and 50 mg / kg ) . melatonin pre @-@ treatment affected in a dual manner barbit@@ urate nar@@ cosis , however , no dose @-@ effect correlation was found@@ . in particular , low doses reduced the latency to and prolonged the duration of barbit@@ urate narco@@ si@@ s. in contrast , the highest dose of melatonin ( 50 mg / kg ) caused a paradoxical increase in the latency and produced a sustained reduction of the duration of nar@@ cosis , and a reduction in mortality rat@@ e. melatonin 0.5 and 5 mg / kg influenced the duration but not the latency of ket@@ amin@@ e- or diazepam @-@ induced narco@@ si@@ s. thus , the dual action of melatonin on pharmacological nar@@ cosis seems to be specific for the barbit@@ urate mechanism of action .
effects of ni@@ k @-@ 247 on cholinesterase and scopolamine @-@ induced amne@@ si@@ a. the effects of ni@@ k @-@ 247 on cholinesterase , scopolamine @-@ induced amnesia and spontaneous movement were examined and compared with those of the well @-@ known cholinesterase inhibitors tac@@ rine and e @-@ 20@@ 20@@ . ni@@ k @-@ 247 , tac@@ rine and e @-@ 2020 all strongly inhibited acetylcholinesterase ( ache ) in human red blood cells ( ic@@ 50s = 1.0 x 10 ( -6 ) , 2.9 x 10 ( -7 ) and 3.7 x 10 ( -8 ) m , respectively ) . in addition , ni@@ k @-@ 247 and tac@@ rine , but not e @-@ 2020 , strongly inhibited butyr@@ yl@@ chol@@ ine@@ str@@ ase ( bu@@ che ) in human ser@@ um@@ . all three drugs produced mixed inhibition of ache activ@@ it@@ y@@ . moreover , the inhibitory effect of ni@@ k @-@ 247 on ache was rever@@ si@@ ble@@ . all compounds at 0.1 @-@ 1 mg / kg p.o. significantly improved the amnesia induced by scopolamine ( 0.5 mg / kg s.c. ) in rats performing a passive avoidance tas@@ k@@ . the three compounds at 1 and 3 mg / kg p.o. did not significantly decrease spontaneous movement by rat@@ s. these findings suggest that ni@@ k @-@ 247 at a low dose ( 0.1 @-@ 1 mg / kg p.o. ) improves scopolamine @-@ induced amnesia but does not affect spontaneous mo@@ v@@ ement@@ . the findings suggest that ni@@ k @-@ 247 may be a useful drug for the treatment of al@@ z@@ heimer &apos;s disease .

apparent cure of rheumatoid arthritis by bone marrow transpl@@ ant@@ ation@@ . we describe the induction of sustained remissions and possible cure of severe erosive rheumatoid arthritis ( ra ) by bone marrow transplantation ( b@@ mt ) in 2 patient@@ s. b@@ mt was used to treat severe aplastic anemia which was caused by gold in one case and d @-@ penicillamine in the other@@ . in the 8 and 6 years since the transplants ( representing 8 and 4 years since cessation of all immunosuppressive therapy , respectively ) , the ra in each case has been completely qui@@ esc@@ ent@@ . although short term remission of severe ra following b@@ mt has been reported , these are the first cases for which prolonged followup has been avail@@ ab@@ le@@ . this experience raises the question of the role of b@@ mt itself as a therapeutic option for patients with uncontrolled destructive synovitis .
urinary enzymes and protein patterns as indicators of injury to different regions of the kidne@@ y@@ . acute experimental models of renal damage to the proximal tubular , glomerular , and papillary regions of the rat were produced by administration of hex@@ ach@@ lor@@ o @-@ 1 : 3 @-@ but@@ adiene ( h@@ c@@ b@@ d ) , puromycin amin@@ onucle@@ oside ( pan ) , and 2 @-@ bromo@@ ethylamine ( be@@ a ) , respec@@ ti@@ vel@@ y@@ . several routine indicators of nephrotoxicity , the enzymes alkaline phosphatase and n @-@ acetyl @-@ beta @-@ glucosaminidase , and the molecular weight of protein excretion were determined on urine sam@@ pl@@ es@@ . tubular damage produced by h@@ c@@ b@@ d or be@@ a was discriminated both quantitatively and qualitatively from glomerular damage produced by pan@@ . the latter was characterized by a pronounced increase in protein excretion , especially proteins with molecular weight greater than 40,000 da@@ . in contrast , protein excretion in tubular damage was raised only slightly and characterized by excretion of proteins of a wide range of molecular weigh@@ ts@@ . proximal tubular damage caused by h@@ c@@ b@@ d and papillary damage caused by be@@ a were distinguished both by conventional urinalysis ( volume and specific gravity ) and by measurement of the two urinary enzym@@ es@@ . alkaline phosphatase and glucose were markedly and transiently elevated in proximal tubular damage and n @-@ acetyl @-@ beta @-@ glucosaminidase showed a sustained elevation in papillary dam@@ ag@@ e. it is concluded that both selective urinary enzymes and the molecular weight pattern of urinary proteins can be used to provide diagnostic information about the possible site of renal damage .

tolerability of nim@@ es@@ ul@@ ide and paracetamol in patients with n@@ said @-@ induced urticaria / angio@@ ede@@ ma@@ . previous studies evaluated the tolerance of nim@@ es@@ ul@@ ide and paracetamol in subjects with cutaneous , respiratory and anaphy@@ lacto@@ id reactions induced by nonsteroidal anti @-@ inflammatory drugs ( n@@ sa@@ ids ) . in this study we investigated tolerability and reliability of nim@@ es@@ ul@@ ide and paracetamol in a very large number of patients with an exclusive well @-@ documented history of n@@ said @-@ induced urticaria / angio@@ ede@@ ma@@ . furthermore , we evaluated whether some factors have the potential to increase the risk of reaction to paracetamol and nim@@ es@@ ul@@ ide@@ . a single @-@ placebo @-@ controlled oral challenge procedure with nim@@ es@@ ul@@ ide or paracetamol was applied to 8@@ 29 patients with a history of n@@ said @-@ induced urticaria / angio@@ ede@@ ma@@ . a total of 75 / 8@@ 29 ( 9.4 % ) patients experienced reactions to nim@@ es@@ ul@@ ide or par@@ acet@@ am@@ ol@@ . of the 7@@ 15 patients tested with nim@@ es@@ ul@@ ide 62 ( 8.6 % ) showed a positive test , while of 114 subjects submitted to the challenge with paracetamol , 13 ( 9.6 % ) did not tolerate this dru@@ g. furthermore , 18.@@ 28 % of patients with a history of chronic urticaria and 11.8 % of subjects with an history of n@@ said @-@ induced urticaria / angioedema or angioedema alone ( with or without chronic urticaria ) resulted to be intolerant to alternative dru@@ g@@ s. taken together , our results confirm the good tolerability of nim@@ es@@ ul@@ ide and paracetamol in patients who experienced urticaria / angioedema caused by n@@ sa@@ id@@ s. however , the risk of reaction to these alternative study drugs is statistically increased by a history of chronic urticaria and , above all , by a history of n@@ said @-@ induced angioedema .
effects of verapamil on atrial fibrillation and its electrophysiological determinants in dog@@ s. background : atrial tachycardia @-@ induced remodeling promotes the occurrence and maintenance of atrial fibrillation ( af ) and decreases l @-@ type ca ( 2 + ) curren@@ t. there is also a clinical suggestion that acute l @-@ type ca ( 2 ) channel blockade can promote af , consistent with an af promoting effect of ca ( 2 + ) channel inhib@@ iti@@ on@@ . methods : to evaluate the potential mechanisms of af promotion by ca ( 2 + ) channel blockers , we administered verapamil to morphine @-@ chlor@@ al@@ ose anesthetized dog@@ s. diltiazem was used as a comparison drug and autonomic blockade with atropine and nad@@ olol was applied in some experim@@ ent@@ s. epicardial mapping with 240 epicardial electrodes was used to evaluate activation during af@@ . results : verapamil caused af promotion in six dogs , increasing mean duration of af induced by burst pacing , from 8 + / -4 s ( mean + / -@@ s.@@ e. ) to 95 + / -@@ 39 s ( p &lt; 0.01 vs. control ) at a loading dose of 0.1 mg / kg and 228 + / -@@ 101 s ( p &lt; 0.0005 vs. control ) at a dose of 0.2 mg / k@@ g. underlying electrophysiological mechanisms were studied in detail in five additional dogs under control conditions and in the presence of the higher dose of ver@@ ap@@ amil@@ . in these experiments , verapamil shortened mean effective refractory period ( er@@ p ) from 122 + / -5 to 114 + / -4 ms ( p &lt; 0.02 ) at a cycle length of 300 ms , decreased er@@ p heterogeneity ( from 15 + / -1 to 10 + / -1 % , p &lt; 0.05 ) , heterogene@@ ously accelerated atrial conduction and decreased the cycle length of af ( 94 + / -4 to 84 + / -3 ms , p &lt; 0.005 ) . diltiazem did not affect er@@ p , af cycle length or af duration , but produced conduction acceleration similar to that caused by verapamil ( n = 5 ) . in the presence of autonomic blockade , verapamil failed to promote af and increased , rather than decreasing , refrac@@ tor@@ in@@ ess@@ . neither verapamil nor diltiazem affected atrial conduction in the presence of autonomic bloc@@ k@@ ade@@ . epicardial mapping suggested that verapamil promoted af by increasing the number of simultaneous wave@@ fron@@ ts reflected by separate zones of reactivation in each cycl@@ e. conclusions : verapamil promotes af in normal dogs by promoting multiple circuit reentry , an effect dependent on intact autonomic tone and not shared by diltiazem .
hypotension , bradycardia , and as@@ yst@@ ole after high @-@ dose intravenous methylprednisolone in a monitored patient@@ . we report a case of hypotension , bradycardia , and as@@ yst@@ ole after intravenous administration of high @-@ dose methylprednisolone in a 73 @-@ year @-@ old patient who underwent electrocardiographic ( ec@@ g ) monitoring throughout the ep@@ iso@@ de@@ . there was a history of ischemic cardiac disease 9 years earli@@ er@@ . the patient was admitted with a pulmonary @-@ renal syndrome with hemoptysis , rapidly progressive renal failure , and hypoxemia that required mechanical ventilation in the intensive care un@@ it@@ . after receiving advanced cardiopulmonary resuscitation , the patient recovered cardiac rhyth@@ m. the ec@@ g showed a junctional rhythm without ventricular arrhyth@@ mi@@ a. this study reviews the current proposed mechanisms of sudden death after a high dose of intravenous methylprednisolone ( iv@@ m@@ p ) . these mechanisms are not well understood because , in most cases , the patients were not monitored at the moment of the event@@ . rapid infusion and underlying cardiac disease were important risk factors in the case reported here , and the authors dis@@ count ventricular arrhythmia as the main mechanism .
lifetime treatment of mice with az@@ id@@ oth@@ ym@@ idine ( az@@ t ) produces myelodys@@ plasi@@ a. az@@ t has induced a macro@@ cytic anemia in aids patients on long term az@@ t therap@@ y@@ . it is generally assumed that d@@ na elongation is stopped by the insertion of az@@ t into the chain in place of thymidine thus preventing the phosphate hydroxyl linkages and therefore suppresses hemopoietic progenitor cell proliferation in an early stage of differenti@@ ation@@ . c@@ ba / ca male mice started on az@@ t 0.75 mg / ml h@@ 2@@ o at 84 days of age and kept on it for 6@@ 87 days when dosage reduced to 0.5 mg / ml h@@ 2@@ o for a group , another group removed from az@@ t to see recovery , and third group remained on 0.75 m@@ g. at 6@@ 87 days mice that had been on 0.75 mg had average platelet counts of 2.5 x 10 ( 6 ) . histological examination on 9 of 10 mice with such thrombocytopenia showed changes compatible with myelodysplastic syndrome ( m@@ ds ) . a variety of histological patterns was obser@@ ve@@ d. there were two cases of hyp@@ ocellular myelodys@@ plasia , two cases of hyper@@ segmented myelodysplastic granul@@ ocytosis , two cases of hyper@@ cellular marrow with abnormal megakaryocytes with b@@ iz@@ ar@@ re nuclei , one case of megakary@@ ocytic myel@@ osis associated with a hyperplastic marrow , dys@@ myel@@ opoiesis and a hyp@@ ocellular marrow and two cases of myelodys@@ plasia with dy@@ ser@@ y@@ thro@@ po@@ iesis , hem@@ osider@@ osis and a hyp@@ ocellular mar@@ row@@ . above mentioned az@@ t incorporation may have induced an ineffective hem@@ opoiesis in the primitive hemopoietic progenitor cells , which is known to be seen commonly in the myelodysplastic syndrome .
influence of diet free of n@@ ad @-@ precursors on acetaminophen hepatotoxicity in mic@@ e. recently , we demonstrated the hepatoprotective effects of nicotinic acid amide , a selective inhibitor of poly ( ad@@ p @-@ ribose ) polymerase ( par@@ p ; e@@ c 2.@@ 4.@@ 2.30 ) on mice suffering from acetaminophen ( a@@ ap ) -@@ hepatitis , suggesting that the a@@ ap @-@ induced liver injury involves a step which depends on aden@@ orib@@ osyl@@ ation@@ . the present study investigates the effects of a diet free of precursors of n@@ ad , the substrate on which par@@ p acts , in female nm@@ ri mice with a@@ ap hepatitis and evaluates the influence of simultaneous ethanol consumption in these anim@@ al@@ s. liver injuries were quantified as serum activities of glutamate @-@ oxal@@ oacetate transaminase ( got ) and glutamate @-@ pyruvate transaminase ( gp@@ t ) . while a@@ ap caused a 117 @-@ fold elevation of serum transaminase activities in mice kept on a standard laboratory diet , which was significantly exacerbated by ethanol and inhibited by nicotinic acid amide ( na@@ a ) , adverse effects were noted in animals fed a diet free of precursors of nad@@ . in these animals , only minor increases of serum transaminase activities were measured in the presence of a@@ ap , and unlike the exacerbation caused by ethanol in mice on a standard diet , the liver damage was inhibited by 50 % by ethan@@ ol@@ . a further 64 % reduction of hepatitis was observed , when na@@ a was given to ethanol / a@@ ap @-@ mic@@ e. our results provide evidence that the a@@ ap @-@ induced hepatitis and its exacerbation by ethanol can either be reduced by end @-@ product inhibition of par@@ p by na@@ a or by dietary depletion of the enzyme &apos;s substrate nad@@ . we see the main application of na@@ a as for the combin@@ ational use in pharmaceutical preparations of acetaminophen in order to avoid hepatic damage in patients treated with this widely used analgesic .
antiarrhythmic plasma concentrations of c@@ ib@@ enz@@ oline on canine ventricular arrhyth@@ mi@@ as@@ . using two @-@ stage coronary lig@@ ation- , digit@@ alis@@ - , and adrenaline @-@ induced canine ventricular arrhythmias , antiarrhythmic effects of c@@ ib@@ enz@@ oline were examined and the minimum effective plasma concentration for each arrhythmia model was determin@@ ed@@ . c@@ ib@@ enz@@ oline suppressed all the arrhythmias , and the minimum effective plasma concentrations for arrhythmias induced by 24 @-@ h coronary ligation , 48 @-@ h coronary ligation , digitalis , and adrenaline were 1.9 + / - 0.9 ( by 8 mg / kg i.v. ) , 1.6 + / - 0.5 ( by 8 mg / kg i.v. ) , 0.6 + / - 0.2 ( by 2 mg / kg i.v. ) , and 3.5 + / - 1.3 ( by 5 mg / kg i.v. ) micrograms / ml , respectively ( mean + / - s@@ d@@ m , n = 6 @-@ 7 ) . the concentration for adrenaline @-@ induced arrhythmia was significantly higher than those for the other types of arrhyth@@ mi@@ as@@ . this pharmacological profile is similar to those of mex@@ ile@@ tine and toc@@ ainide , and all three drugs have central nervous system ( c@@ ns ) stimulant action@@ . because c@@ ib@@ enz@@ oline had only weak hypotensive and sinus node depressive effects and was found to be orally active when given to coronary ligation arrhythmia dogs , its clinical usefulness is expected .
immun@@ opathology of penicillamine @-@ induced glomerular dise@@ as@@ e. four patients with rheumatoid arthritis developed heavy proteinuria after five to 12 months of treatment with d @-@ penicill@@ amin@@ e. light microscopy of renal biopsy samples showed minimal glomerular capillary wall thickening and mesangial matrix increase , or no departure from normal@@ . electron microscopy , however , revealed subepithelial electron @-@ dense deposits , fusion of epithelial cell foot processes , and evidence of mesangial cell hyper@@ activ@@ it@@ y@@ . immunofluorescence microscopy demonstrated granular capillary wall deposits of ig@@ g and c@@ 3. the findings were similar to those in early membranous glomerulonephritis , differences being observed however in the results of staining for the early @-@ acting complement components c@@ 1@@ q and c@@ 4@@ . it is tentatively concluded that complement was activated by the classical pathway .
ventricular fibrillation from di@@ atr@@ iz@@ oate with and without chelating ag@@ ent@@ s. the toxicity of ren@@ ogra@@ fin 76 % was compared with that of hy@@ pa@@ que 76 % by selective injection of each into the right coronary artery of dog@@ s. ren@@ ogra@@ fin contains the chelating agents sodium citrate and disodium ede@@ tate , while hy@@ pa@@ que contains calcium disodium ede@@ tate and no sodium citr@@ at@@ e. ventricular fibrillation occurred significantly more often with ren@@ ogra@@ fin , suggesting that chelating agents contribute to toxicity in coronary angiography .
rapid reversal of anticoagulation reduces hemorrhage volume in a mouse model of warfarin @-@ associated intracerebral hemorrh@@ ag@@ e. warfarin @-@ associated intracerebral hemorrhage ( w @-@ ich ) is a severe type of stro@@ ke@@ . there is no consensus on the optimal treatment for w @-@ ich@@ . using a mouse model , we tested whether the rapid reversal of anticoagulation using human prothrombin complex concentrate ( p@@ cc ) can reduce hemorrhagic blood volu@@ me@@ . male c@@ d @-@ 1 mice were treated with warfarin ( 2 mg / kg over 24 h ) , resulting in a mean ( + / -@@ s.d. ) international normalized ratio of 3.5 + / -@@ 0.9@@ . first , we showed that an intravenous administration of human p@@ cc rapidly reversed anticoagulation in mic@@ e. second , a stereotactic injection of collagenase was administered to induce hemorrhage in the right stri@@ at@@ um@@ . forty @-@ five minutes later , the animals were randomly treated with p@@ cc ( 100 u / kg ) or saline i.v. ( n = 12 per group ) . twenty @-@ four hours after hemorrhage induction , hemorrhagic blood volume was quantified using a photometric hemoglobin ass@@ ay@@ . the mean hemorrhagic blood volume was reduced in p@@ cc @-@ treated animals ( 6.5 + / -@@ 3.1 microl ) compared with saline controls ( 15.3 + / -@@ 11.2 microl , p = 0.015 ) . in the saline group , 45 % of the mice developed large hematomas ( i.e. , &gt; 15 microl ) . in contrast , such extensive lesions were never found in the p@@ cc grou@@ p. we provide experimental data suggesting p@@ cc to be an effective acute treatment for w @-@ ich in terms of reducing hemorrhagic blood volu@@ me@@ . future studies are needed to assess the therapeutic potential emerging from our finding for human w @-@ ich .
impact of alcohol exposure after pregnancy recognition on ultrasonographic fetal growth measu@@ res@@ . background : more than 3 decades after j@@ ones and sm@@ ith ( 1973 ) reported on the devast@@ ation caused by alcohol exposure on fetal development , the rates of heavy drinking during pregnancy remain relatively un@@ chang@@ ed@@ . early identification of fetal alcohol exposure and maternal abstinence led to better infant outcom@@ es@@ . this study examined the utility of bi@@ ometry for detecting alcohol @-@ related fetal growth impair@@ ment@@ . methods : we obtained fetal ultrasound measures from routine ultrasound examinations for 167 pregnant hazardous drinkers who were enrolled in a brief alcohol intervention stud@@ y@@ . the fetal measures for women who quit after learning of their pregnancies were compared with measures for women who continued some drinking throughout the course of their pregn@@ anc@@ i@@ es@@ . because intensity of alcohol consumption is associated with poorer fetal outcomes , separate analyses were conducted for the heavy ( average of &gt; or = 5 drinks per drinking day ) alcohol con@@ su@@ mer@@ s. fetal measures from the heavy @-@ exposed fetuses were also compared with measures from a non@@ drinking group that was representative of normal , uncomplicated pregnancies from our clinic@@ s. analyses of covariance were used to determine whether there were differences between groups after controlling for influences of gestational age and drug ab@@ use@@ . results : nearly half of the pregnant drinkers ab@@ stained after learning of their pregn@@ anc@@ i@@ es@@ . when women reportedly quit drinking early in their pregnancies , fetal growth measures were not significantly different from a non @-@ alcohol @-@ exposed group , regardless of prior drinking pattern@@ s. any alcohol consumption post@@ pregnancy recognition among the heavy drinkers resulted in reduced cerebellar growth as well as decreased cranial to body growth in comparison with women who either quit drinking or who were non@@ drin@@ ker@@ s. amphetamine abuse was predictive of larger cranial to body growth rati@@ os@@ . conclusions : alterations in fetal bi@@ ometric measurements were observed among the heavy drinkers only when they continued drinking after becoming aware of their pregn@@ anc@@ i@@ es@@ . although the reliance on self @-@ reported drinking is a limitation in this study , these findings support the benefits of early abstinence and the potential for ultrasound examinations in the detection of fetal alcohol effects .

acute cholestatic hepatitis after exposure to iso@@ flur@@ ane@@ . objective : to report a case of acute cholestatic hepatitis following exposure to the inhal@@ ational anesthetic iso@@ flur@@ ane@@ . case summary : a 70 @-@ year @-@ old healthy woman from ir@@ a@@ q developed acute cholestatic hepatitis 3 weeks following repair of the right rotator cuff under general anesthesi@@ a. there was no evidence for viral , autoimmune , or metabolic causes of hepati@@ tis@@ . no other medications were involved except for di@@ pyr@@ one for analge@@ si@@ a. the alanine aminotransferase was elevated to a peak concentration of 15@@ 33 u / l and the serum bilirubin reached a peak of 17.0 mg / dl@@ . there was slow improvement over 4 mon@@ th@@ s. accidental re@@ exposure by the patient to di@@ pyr@@ one was unevent@@ ful@@ . discussion : the clinical and histologic picture of this case resembles halothane hepatitis , which has a significant mortality rat@@ e. conclusions : isoflurane , a common anesthetic agent , can cause severe cholestatic hepatitis .
calcitonin gene @-@ related peptide levels during nitric oxide @-@ induced headache in patients with chronic tension @-@ type head@@ ac@@ he@@ . it has been proposed that nitric oxide ( no ) induced headache in primary headaches may be associated with release of calcitonin gene @-@ related peptide ( c@@ gr@@ p ) . in the present study we aimed to investigate plasma levels of c@@ gr@@ p during headache induced by the no donor glycer@@ yl trin@@ itrate ( g@@ t@@ n ) in 16 patients with chronic tension @-@ type headache and 16 healthy contro@@ l@@ s. the subjects were randomly allocated to receive 0.5 microg / kg / min g@@ t@@ n or placebo over 20 min on two headache @-@ free day@@ s. blood samples were collected at baseline , 10 , 20 and 60 min after start of infu@@ sion@@ . both patients and controls developed significantly stronger immediate headache on the g@@ t@@ n day than on the placebo day and the headache was significantly more pronounced in patients than in contro@@ l@@ s. there was no difference between the area under the c@@ gr@@ p curve ( auc@@ c@@ gr@@ p ) on g@@ t@@ n vs. placebo day in either patients ( p = 0.65 ) or controls ( p = 0.48 ) . the auc@@ c@@ gr@@ p recorded on the g@@ t@@ n day did not differ between patients and controls ( p = 0.36 ) . both in patients and controls , c@@ gr@@ p levels changed significantly over time , on both the g@@ t@@ n and placebo days ( p &lt; 0.05 ) . the present study indicates that no @-@ induced immediate headache is not associated with release of c@@ gr@@ p .
myocardial ischemia due to coronary artery spasm during dobutamine stress echocardi@@ og@@ rap@@ hy@@ . dobutamine stress echocardiography ( d@@ se ) is a useful and safe provocation test for myocardial ischem@@ i@@ a. until now , the test has been focused only on the organic lesion in the coronary artery , and positive d@@ se has indicated the presence of significant fixed coronary artery sten@@ osi@@ s. the aim of the present study is to examine whether myocardial ischemia due to coronary spasm is induced by d@@ obut@@ amin@@ e. we performed d@@ se on 51 patients with coronary spastic angina but without significant fixed coronary artery sten@@ osi@@ s. all patients had anginal attacks at rest with st elevation on the electrocardiogram ( variant angina ) . coronary spasm was induced by intracoronary injection of acetylcholine , and no fixed coronary artery stenosis was documented on angiograms in all patient@@ s. d@@ se was performed with intravenous dobutamine infusion with an incremental doses of 5 , 10 , 20 , 30 , and 40 microg / kg / min every 5 min@@ ut@@ es@@ . of the 51 patients , 7 patients showed as@@ yn@@ ergy with st elev@@ ation@@ . all 7 patients ( 13.7 % ) had chest pain during as@@ yn@@ ergy , and both chest pain and electrocardiographic changes were preceded by as@@ yn@@ erg@@ y@@ . these findings indicate that dobutamine can provoke coronary spasm in some patients with coronary spastic ang@@ in@@ a. when d@@ se is performed to evaluate coronary artery disease , not only fixed coronary stenosis , but also coronary spasm should be considered as a genesis of as@@ yn@@ ergy .
nitric oxide synthase expression in the course of lead @-@ induced hyper@@ ten@@ sion@@ . we recently showed elevated reactive oxygen species ( ro@@ s ) , reduced urinary excretion of no metabolites ( no@@ x ) , and increased no sequestration as nitro@@ tyrosine in various tissues in rats with lead @-@ induced hyper@@ ten@@ sion@@ . this study was designed to discern whether the reduction in urinary no@@ x in lead @-@ induced hypertension is , in part , due to depressed no synthase ( nos ) expres@@ sion@@ . male sp@@ rag@@ ue @-@ d@@ aw@@ ley rats were randomly assigned to a lead @-@ treated group ( given lead acetate , 100 ppm , in drinking water and regular rat chow ) , a group given lead and vitamin e @-@ fortified chow , or a normal control group given either regular food and water or vitamin e @-@ fortified food for 12 week@@ s. tail blood pressure , urinary no@@ x excretion , plasma malondialdehyde ( m@@ da ) , and endothelial and inducible nos ( en@@ os and in@@ os ) isotypes in the aorta and kidney were measure@@ d. the lead @-@ treated group exhibited a rise in blood pressure and plasma m@@ da concentration , a fall in urinary no@@ x excretion , and a paradoxical rise in vascular and renal tissue en@@ os and in@@ os expres@@ sion@@ . vitamin e supplementation ameliorated hypertension , lowered plasma m@@ da concentration , and raised urinary no@@ x excretion while significantly lowering vascular , but not renal , tissue en@@ os and in@@ os expres@@ sion@@ . vitamin e supplementation had no effect on either blood pressure , plasma m@@ da , or nos expression in the control grou@@ p. the study also revealed significant inhibition of nos enzymatic activity by lead in cell @-@ free prepar@@ ation@@ s. in conclusion , lead @-@ induced hypertension in this model was associated with a compensatory upregulation of renal and vascular en@@ os and in@@ os expres@@ sion@@ . this is , in part , due to ro@@ s @-@ mediated no inactivation , lead @-@ associated inhibition of nos activity , and perhaps stimulatory actions of increased shear stress associated with hypertension .
risk for valvular heart disease among users of fenfluramine and dex@@ fenfluramine who underwent echocardiography before use of medic@@ ation@@ . background : because uncontrolled echocardiographic surveys suggested that up to 30 % to 38 % of users of fenfluramine and dex@@ fenfluramine had valvular disease , these drugs were withdrawn from the mark@@ et@@ . objective : to determine the risk for new or worsening valvular abnormalities among users of fenfluramine or dex@@ fenfluramine who underwent echocardiography before they began to take these medic@@ ation@@ s. design : cohort stud@@ y@@ . setting : academic primary care practic@@ es@@ . patients : 46 patients who used fenfluramine or dex@@ fenfluramine for 14 days or more and had echocardiograms obtained before therap@@ y@@ . measurements : follow @-@ up echocardi@@ og@@ rap@@ hy@@ . the primary outcome was new or worsening valvul@@ opathy , defined as progression of either aortic or mitral regurgitation by at least one degree of severity and disease that met u@@ .@@ s. food and drug administration criteria ( at least mild aortic regurgitation or moderate mitral regurgitation ) . results : two patients ( 4.3 % &#91; 95 % ci , 0.6 % to 14.8 % &#93; ) receiving fenfluramine @-@ phen@@ ter@@ mine developed valvular heart dise@@ as@@ e. one had baseline bic@@ uspid aortic valve and mild aortic regurgitation that progressed to moderate regurg@@ it@@ ation@@ . the second patient developed new moderate aortic insuffici@@ enc@@ y@@ . conclusion : users of diet medications are at risk for valvular heart dise@@ as@@ e. however , the incidence may be lower than that reported previously .
carboplatin toxic effects on the peripheral nervous system of the rat@@ . background : the most striking of carboplatin &apos;s advantages ( c@@ b@@ d@@ ca ) over cisplatin ( cd@@ d@@ p ) is its markedly reduced rate of neurotoxic effec@@ ts@@ . however , the use of c@@ b@@ d@@ ca higher @-@ intensity schedules and the association with other neurotoxic drugs in poly@@ chemotherapy may cause some concern about its safety with respect to peripheral nervous system dam@@ ag@@ e. materials and methods : two different schedules of c@@ b@@ d@@ ca administration ( 10 mg / kg and 15 mg / kg i.p. twice a week for nine times ) were evaluated in w@@ istar rat@@ s. neurotoxicity was assessed for behavioral ( tail @-@ flick test ) , neurophysiological ( nerve conduction velocity in the tail nerve ) , morphological , morph@@ ometrical and analytical effec@@ ts@@ . results : c@@ b@@ d@@ ca administration induced dose @-@ dependent peripheral neuro@@ toxic@@ it@@ y@@ . pain perception and nerve conduction velocity in the tail were significantly impaired , particularly after the high @-@ dose treat@@ ment@@ . the dorsal root ganglia sensory neurons and , to a lesser extent , satellite cells showed the same changes as those induced by cd@@ d@@ p , mainly affecting the nucleus and nucleolus of ganglionic sensory neuron@@ s. moreover , significant amounts of platinum were detected in the dorsal root ganglia and kidney after c@@ b@@ d@@ ca treat@@ ment@@ . conclusions : c@@ b@@ d@@ ca is neurotoxic in our model , and the type of pathological changes it induces are so closely similar to those caused by cd@@ d@@ p that it is probable that neurotoxicity is induced in the two drugs by the same mechanis@@ m. this model can be used alone or in combination with other drugs to explore the effect of c@@ b@@ d@@ ca on the peripheral nervous system .
iatrogenic risks of endometrial carcinoma after treatment for breast cancer in a large f@@ rench case @-@ control stud@@ y@@ . f d ration nation@@ ale des centres de lut@@ te contr@@ e le cancer ( f@@ n@@ cl@@ cc ) . since tamoxifen is widely used in breast cancer treatment and has been proposed for the prevention of breast cancer , its endometrial iatrogenic effects must be carefully examin@@ ed@@ . we have investigated the association between endometrial cancer and tamoxifen use or other treatments in women treated for breast cancer in a case @-@ control stud@@ y@@ . cases of endometrial cancer diagnosed after breast cancer ( n = 135 ) and 4@@ 67 controls matched for age , year of diagnosis of breast cancer and hospital and survival time with an intact uterus were in@@ clu@@ de@@ d. women who had received tamoxifen were significantly more likely to have endometrial cancer diagnosed than those who had not ( crude relative risk = 4.9 , p = 0.0001 ) . univariate and adjusted analyses showed that the risk increased with the length of treatment ( p = 0.0001 ) or the cumulative dose of tamoxifen received ( p = 0.0001 ) , irrespective of the daily dos@@ e. women who had undergone pelvic radiotherapy also had a higher risk ( crude relative risk = 7.8 , p = 0.0001 ) . after adjusting for confounding factors , the risk was higher for tamoxifen users ( p = 0.00@@ 12 ) , treatment for more than 3 years ( all p &lt; 0.03 ) and pelvic radiotherapy ( p = 0.012 ) . women who had endometrial cancer and had received tamoxifen had more advanced disease and poorer prognosis than those with endometrial cancer who had not received this treat@@ ment@@ . our results suggest a causal role of tamoxifen in endometrial cancer , particularly when used as currently proposed for breast cancer pre@@ venti@@ on@@ . pelvic radiotherapy may be an additional iatrogenic factor for women with breast cancer@@ . endometrial cancers diagnosed in women treated with tamoxifen have poorer prog@@ no@@ si@@ s. women who receive tamoxifen for breast cancer should be offered gynaecological surveillance during and after treat@@ ment@@ . a long @-@ term evaluation of the risk @-@ benefit ratio of tamoxifen as a preventive treatment for breast cancer is clearly warranted .
granulosa cell tumor of the ovary associated with antecedent tamoxifen use@@ . background : increased attention has been focused recently on the estrogenic effects of tam@@ oxif@@ en@@ . review of the literature reveals an association between tamoxifen use and gynecologic tumor@@ s. case : a 52 @-@ year @-@ old postmenopausal woman was treated with tamoxifen for stage ii estrogen receptor @-@ positive breast carcin@@ om@@ a. her aspartate transaminase and alanine transaminase levels increase markedly after 6 months of tamoxifen use@@ . after an additional 17 months of elevated serum transaminases , the patient was found to have a stage ic granulosa cell tumor of the ov@@ ary@@ . conclusion : patients with tamoxifen @-@ induced liver dysfunction may be at increased risk for granulosa cell tumors because of alterations in tamoxifen metabolism .
a murine model of adenomy@@ osis : the effects of hyperprolactinemia induced by fluoxetine hydrochloride , a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor , on adenomy@@ osis induction in w@@ istar albino rat@@ s. objective : the aim of this study was to investigate whether fluoxetine given to castrated and non@@ castrated rats caused hyperprolactinemia and its effects with respect to adenomy@@ osi@@ s. design : fluoxetine , a serotonin reuptake inhibitor , was given to w@@ istar albino rats for 98 days to produce hyperprolactin@@ em@@ i@@ a. the drug was given to two groups consisting of castrated and non@@ castrated rats and compared to two groups of castrated and non@@ castrated contro@@ l@@ s. prolactin levels were measured and the uteri of the rats were removed for histopathological analysis at the end of 98 day@@ s. setting : mar@@ mar@@ a university school of medicine , department of histology and embry@@ ology , z@@ ey@@ ne@@ p k@@ amil women and children &apos;s hospit@@ al@@ . main outcome measures : serum prolactin levels , uterine histopath@@ olog@@ y@@ . results : the prolactin levels of castrated and non@@ castrated groups treated with fluoxetine were statistically significantly higher when compared to their respective control grou@@ ps@@ . histological studies revealed 11 cases of adenomy@@ osis , all within the non@@ castrated group receiving flu@@ ox@@ eti@@ ne@@ . conclusion : it was suggested that high serum prolactin levels cause degeneration of myometrial cells in the presence of ovarian steroids that results in a myometrial invasion by endometrial stro@@ ma@@ . this invasion eventually progresses to adenomy@@ osis .
effects of deliberate hypotension induced by lab@@ et@@ alol with isoflurane on neuropsychological function@@ . the effect of deliberate hypotension on brain function measured by neuropsychological tests was studied in 41 adult patient@@ s. twenty @-@ four patients were anaesthetized for middle @-@ ear surgery with deliberate hypotension induced by lab@@ et@@ alol with isoflurane ( hypotensive group ) . seventeen patients without hypotension served as a control grou@@ p. the mean arterial pressure was 77 + / - 2 mm@@ h@@ g ( 10.3 + / - 0.3 k@@ pa ) before hypotension and 50 + / - 0 mm@@ h@@ g ( 6.7 + / - 0.0 k@@ pa ) during hypotension in the hypotensive group , and 86 + / - 2 mm@@ h@@ g ( 11.5 + / - 0.3 k@@ pa ) during anaesthesia in the control grou@@ p. the following psychological tests were performed : four sub@@ tests of the w@@ ech@@ sler adult intelligence scale ( similarities , digit span , vocabulary and digit symbol ) , tra@@ il @-@ making tests a and b , z@@ ung tests ( self @-@ rating anxiety scale and self @-@ rating depression scale ) and two @-@ part memory test battery with immediate and delayed rec@@ all@@ . the tests were performed preoperatively and 2 days post@@ oper@@ ati@@ vel@@ y@@ . there were no statistically significant differences between the groups in any of the tests in the changes from preoperative value to postoperative valu@@ e. the results indicate that hypotension induced by lab@@ et@@ alol with isoflurane has no significant harmful effects on mental functions compared to normotensive anaesthesia .
auditory disturbance associated with inter@@ scal@@ ene brachial plexus bloc@@ k@@ . we performed an audi@@ ometric study in 20 patients who underwent surgery of the shoulder region under an inter@@ scal@@ ene brachial plexus block ( ib@@ p@@ b ) . bupivacaine 0.75 % with adrenaline was given followed by a 24 @-@ hr continuous infusion of 0.25 % bup@@ ivac@@ ain@@ e. three audi@@ ometric threshold measurements ( 0.25 @-@ 18 kh@@ z ) were made : the first before ib@@ p@@ b , the second 2 @-@ 6 h after surgery and the third on the first day after operation@@ . in four patients hearing impairment on the side of the block was demonstrated after operation , in three measurements on the day of surgery and in one on the following day@@ . the frequencies at which the impairment occurred varied between patients ; in one only low frequencies ( 0.25 @-@ 0.5 kh@@ z ) were invol@@ ve@@ d. the maximum change in threshold was 35 db at 6 kh@@ z measured at the end of the continuous infusion of bup@@ ivac@@ ain@@ e. this patient had hearing threshold changes ( 15 @-@ 20 db ) at 6 @-@ 10 kh@@ z on the opposite side al@@ so@@ . ib@@ p@@ b may cause transient auditory dysfunction in the ipsilateral ear , possibly via an effect on sympathetic innervation .
midazolam compared with thi@@ opent@@ one as an induction ag@@ ent@@ . in patients pre@@ medicated with scopolamine + morphine ( + 5 mg nit@@ razepam the evening before surgery ) , the sleep @-@ inducing effect of midazolam 0.15 mg / kg i.v. was clearly slower in onset than that of thi@@ opent@@ one 4.@@ 67 mg / kg i.v. somewhat fewer cardiovascular and local sequelae were found in the midazolam group , but , although apnoea occurred less often in the midazolam group it lasted long@@ er@@ . on the whole , the differences between midazolam and thi@@ opent@@ one had no apparent clinical con@@ sequ@@ enc@@ es@@ . midazolam is a new alternative agent for induction in combination anaesthesia .
cardi@@ otoxic and possible leukem@@ ogenic effects of adriamycin in nonhuman primates . 10 monkeys ( macaques ) received adriamycin by monthly intravenous injections at 12 mg / m2 ( 1 mg / kg ) . 8 of the 10 monkeys developed congestive heart failure at an average cumulative adriamycin dose ( 310 mg / m2 ) well below that considered the safe upper limit ( 550 mg / m2 ) in man@@ . histologically , the myocardial lesions resembled those found in human anthracycline @-@ induced cardiomyopathy . 1 of the 10 monkeys developed acute myel@@ oblastic leukemia after receiving 324 mg / m2 of adriamycin ; the 10th monkey is alive and well 26 months after the last dose of dru@@ g. our results suggest that adriamycin is a more potent cardi@@ otoxin in monkeys than in man , and that leukemia may be a consequence of prolonged treatment with this drug .
doxorubicin cardiomyopathy in children with left @-@ sided wil@@ ms tumor@@ . two children with wil@@ ms tumor of the left kidney experienced severe anthracycline cardiomyopathy after irradiation to the tumor bed and conventional dosage of dox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in@@ . the cardiomyopathy is attributed 1 ) to the fact that radiation fields for left wil@@ ms tumor include the lower portion of the heart and 2 ) to the interaction of doxorubicin and irradiation on cardiac mus@@ cle@@ . it is recommended that doxorubicin dosage be sharply restricted in children with wil@@ ms tumor of the left kidney who receive postoperative irradiation .
promo@@ tional effects of testosterone and dietary fat on prostate carcinogenesis in genetically susceptible rat@@ s. germ@@ free ( g@@ f ) lob@@ und strain w@@ istar ( l@@ w ) rats , fed vegetable diet l @-@ 485 , have developed prostate adenocarcinomas spontaneously ( 10 % incidence ) at average age 34 mon@@ th@@ s. conventional l@@ w rats , implanted with testosterone at age 4 months , developed a higher incidence of prostate cancer after an average interval of 14 months : 24 % had developed gross tumors , and 40 % when it included microscopic tumor@@ s. preliminary results indicate that testosterone @-@ treated l@@ w rats that were fed the same diet , which was supplemented with corn oil up to 20 % fat , developed prostate cancer after intervals of 6 @-@ 12 mon@@ th@@ s. aged g@@ f sp@@ rag@@ ue @-@ d@@ aw@@ ley ( sd ) rats have not developed prostate cancer spont@@ ane@@ ous@@ ly@@ . conventional sd rats fed diet l @-@ 485 and treated with testosterone developed only prost@@ ati@@ tis@@ . experimental designs should consider genetic susceptibility as a basic prerequisite for studies on experimental prostate cancer .
mitomycin c associated hemolytic uremic syn@@ dro@@ me@@ . mitomycin c associated hemolytic uremic syndrome ( h@@ us ) is a potentially fatal but uncommon condition that is not yet widely recogn@@ is@@ ed@@ . it consists of micro@@ angi@@ opathic hemolytic anemia , thrombocytopenia and progressive renal failure associated with mitomycin c treatment and affects about 10 % of patients treated with this ag@@ ent@@ . the renal failure usually develops about 8 @-@ 10 m@@ th after start of mitomycin c treatment and the mortality is approximately 60 % from renal failure or pulmonary ede@@ ma@@ . renal lesions are similar to those seen in idiopathic h@@ us and include arteriolar fibrin thrombi , expanded sub@@ endothelial zones in glomerular capillary walls , ischemic wrin@@ kling of glomerular basement membranes and mes@@ angi@@ ol@@ ysi@@ s. the mechanism of action is postulated as mitomycin c @-@ induced endothelial cell dam@@ ag@@ e. we describe the clinical course and pathological findings in a 65 yr @-@ old man with gastric adenocarcinoma who developed renal failure and thrombocytopenia while on treatment with mitomycin c and died in pulmonary edema .
continuous ambulatory ec@@ g monitoring during fluorouracil therapy : a prospective stud@@ y@@ . although there have been anecdotal reports of cardiac toxicity associated with fluorouracil ( 5 @-@ f@@ u ) therapy , this phenomenon has not been studied in a systematic fash@@ ion@@ . we prospectively performed continuous ambulatory ec@@ g monitoring on 25 patients undergoing 5 @-@ f@@ u infusion for treatment of solid tumors in order to assess the incidence of ischemic st chang@@ es@@ . patients were monitored for 23 + / - 4 hours before 5 @-@ f@@ u infusion , and 98 + / - 9 hours during 5 @-@ f@@ u infu@@ sion@@ . anginal episodes were rare : only one patient had angina ( during 5 @-@ f@@ u infusion ) . however , asymptomatic st changes ( greater than or equal to 1 mm st deviation ) were common : six of 25 patients ( 24 % ) had st changes before 5 @-@ f@@ u infusion v 17 ( 68 % ) during 5 @-@ f@@ u infusion ( p less than .002 ) . the incidence of ischemic episodes per patient per hour was 0.05 + / - 0.02 prior to 5 @-@ f@@ u infusion v 0.13 + / - 0.03 during 5 @-@ f@@ u infusion ( p less than .001 ) ; the duration of ec@@ g changes was 0.6 + / - 0.3 minutes per patient per hour before 5 @-@ f@@ u v 1.9 + / - 0.5 minutes per patient per hour during 5 @-@ f@@ u ( p less than .01 ) . ec@@ g changes were more common among patients with known coronary artery dise@@ as@@ e. there were two cases of sudden death , both of which occurred at the end of the chemotherapy cour@@ se@@ . we conclude that 5 @-@ f@@ u infusion is associated with a significant increase in silent st segment deviation suggestive of ischemia , particularly among patients with coronary artery dise@@ as@@ e. the mechanism and clinical significance of these ec@@ g changes remain to be determined .
lethal an@@ uria complicating high dose ifosfamide chemotherapy in a breast cancer patient with an impaired renal function@@ . a sixty @-@ year @-@ old woman with advanced breast cancer , previously treated with cisplatin , developed an irreversible lethal renal failure with an@@ uria , the day after 5 g / m2 bolus ifos@@ fam@@ ide@@ . post@@ renal failure was excluded by ech@@ og@@ rap@@ hy@@ . a pre@@ renal component could have contributed to renal failure because of a transient hypotension , due to an increasing asc@@ itis , occurring just before an@@ ur@@ i@@ a. however , correction of the hemodynamic parameters did not improve renal function@@ . ifosfamide is a known nephrotoxic drug with demonstrated tubul@@ opath@@ i@@ es@@ . we strongly suspect that this lethal an@@ uria was mainly due to ifosfamide , occurring in a patient having received previous cisplatin chemotherapy and with poor kidney perfusion due to transient hypot@@ en@@ sion@@ . we recommend careful use of ifosfamide in patients pretreated with nephrotoxic chemotherapy and inadequate renal perfusion .

amelioration of b@@ end@@ ro@@ flu@@ azide @-@ induced hypokalemia by tim@@ ol@@ ol@@ . the beta adrenergic blocking drug , timolol , tended to correct the hypokalemia of short @-@ term b@@ end@@ ro@@ flu@@ azide treatment in 6 healthy male subjects and although the effect was small it was signific@@ ant@@ . timolol also reduced the rise in plasma aldosterone and urine potassium excretion following b@@ end@@ ro@@ flu@@ azide and increased the urine sodium / potassium rati@@ o. there was no evidence of a shift of potassium from the intracellular to the extracellular space .
a cross @-@ sectional evaluation of the effect of risperidone and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors on bone mineral density in bo@@ ys@@ . objective : the aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of risperidone @-@ induced hyperprolactinemia on trabecular bone mineral density ( b@@ m@@ d ) in children and adolesc@@ ent@@ s. method : medically healthy 7- to 17 @-@ year @-@ old males chronically treated , in a naturalistic setting , with risperidone were recruited for this cross @-@ sectional study through child psychiatry outpatient clinics between nov@@ ember 2005 and j@@ une 200@@ 7@@ . anthropometric measurements and laboratory testing were conduc@@ te@@ d. the clinical diagnoses were based on chart review , and developmental and treatment history was obtained from the medical recor@@ d. volumetric b@@ m@@ d of the ultra@@ distal radius was measured using peripheral quantitative computed tomography , and are@@ al b@@ m@@ d of the lumbar spine was estimated using dual @-@ energy x @-@ ray absorp@@ ti@@ ometr@@ y@@ . results : hyperprolactinemia was present in 49 % of 83 boys ( n = 41 ) treated with risperidone for a mean of 2.9 year@@ s. serum testosterone concentration increased with pubertal status but was not affected by hyperprolactin@@ em@@ i@@ a. as expected , bone mineral content and b@@ m@@ d increased with sexual matur@@ it@@ y@@ . after adjusting for the stage of sexual development and height and b@@ mi z scores , serum prolactin was negatively associated with trabecular volumetric b@@ m@@ d at the ultra@@ distal radius ( p &lt; .03 ) . controlling for relevant covariates , we also found treatment with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ( ss@@ ris ) to be associated with lower trabecular b@@ m@@ d at the radius ( p = .03 ) and b@@ m@@ d z score at the lumbar spine ( p &lt; .05 ) . these findings became more marked when the analysis was restricted to non @-@ his@@ panic white patient@@ s. of 13 documented fractures , 3 occurred after risperidone and ss@@ ris were started , and none occurred in patients with hyperprolactin@@ em@@ i@@ a. conclusions : this is the first study to link risperidone @-@ induced hyperprolactinemia and ss@@ ri treatment to lower b@@ m@@ d in children and adolesc@@ ent@@ s. future research should evaluate the longitudinal course of this adverse event to determine its temporal stability and whether a higher fracture rate ensu@@ es .

mice lacking mp@@ ges @-@ 1 are resistant to lithium @-@ induced poly@@ ur@@ i@@ a. cyclooxygenase @-@ 2 activity is required for the development of lithium @-@ induced poly@@ ur@@ i@@ a. however , the involvement of a specific , terminal prostaglandin ( pg ) isomerase has not been evalu@@ ated@@ . the present study was undertaken to assess lithium @-@ induced poly@@ uria in mice deficient in microsomal prostaglandin e synthase @-@ 1 ( mp@@ ges @-@ 1 ) . a 2 @-@ wk administration of lic@@ l ( 4 mm@@ ol.@@ kg ( -1 ) .@@ day ( -1 ) ip ) in mp@@ ges @-@ 1 + / + mice led to a marked poly@@ uria with hypos@@ mo@@ tic ur@@ ine@@ . this was associated with elevated renal mp@@ ges @-@ 1 protein expression and increased urine p@@ ge ( 2 ) excre@@ tion@@ . in contrast , mp@@ ges @-@ 1 - / - mice were largely resistant to lithium @-@ induced poly@@ uria and a urine concentrating defect , accompanied by nearly complete blockade of high urine p@@ ge ( 2 ) and cam@@ p out@@ put@@ . immunoblotting , immunohistochemistry , and quantitative ( q ) rt @-@ p@@ cr consistently detected a significant decrease in aquaporin @-@ 2 ( a@@ q@@ p2 ) protein expression in both the renal cortex and medulla of lithium @-@ treated + / + mic@@ e. this decrease was significantly attenuated in the - / - mic@@ e. q@@ rt @-@ p@@ cr detected similar patterns of changes in a@@ q@@ p2 m@@ r@@ na in the medulla but not in the cor@@ tex@@ . similarly , the total protein abundance of the na @-@ k @-@ 2@@ cl cotransporter ( n@@ k@@ cc@@ 2 ) in the medulla but not in the cortex of the + / + mice was significantly reduced by lithium treat@@ ment@@ . in contrast , the dow@@ regulation of renal medullary n@@ k@@ cc@@ 2 expression was significantly attenuated in the - / - mic@@ e. we conclude that mp@@ ges @-@ 1 @-@ derived p@@ ge ( 2 ) mediates lithium @-@ induced poly@@ uria likely via inhibition of a@@ q@@ p2 and n@@ k@@ cc@@ 2 expression .
identification of a simple and sensitive micro@@ plate method for the detection of over@@ sulfated chondroitin sulfate in heparin produc@@ ts@@ . heparin is a commonly implemented anticoagulant used to treat critically ill patient@@ s. recently , a number of commercial lots of heparin products were found to be contaminated with an over@@ sulfated chondroitin sulfate ( osc@@ s ) derivative that could elicit a hypotensive response in pigs following a single high @-@ dose infu@@ sion@@ . using both contaminated heparin products and the syn@@ thetically produced derivative , we showed that the osc@@ s produces dose @-@ dependent hypotension in pig@@ s. the no observed effect level ( no@@ el ) for this contaminant appears to be approximately 1@@ mg / kg , corresponding to a contamination level of approximately 3 % . we also demonstrated that osc@@ s can be identified in heparin products using a simple , inexpensive , commercially available heparin enzyme immunoassay ( e@@ ia ) kit that has a limit of detection of approximately 0.1 % , well below the no@@ el@@ . this kit may provide a useful method to test heparin products for contamination with over@@ sulfated gag derivatives .
doxorubicin cardiomyopathy @-@ induced inflammation and apoptosis are attenuated by gene deletion of the kinin b1 recep@@ tor@@ . clinical use of the anthracycline doxorubicin ( dox ) is limited by its cardi@@ otoxic effects , which are attributed to the induction of apopto@@ si@@ s. to elucidate the possible role of the kinin b1 receptor ( b@@ 1@@ r ) during the development of dox cardiomyopathy , we studied b@@ 1@@ r knockout mice ( b@@ 1@@ r ( - / - ) ) by investigating cardiac inflammation and apoptosis after induction of dox @-@ induced cardiomy@@ opath@@ y@@ . dox control mice showed cardiac dysfunction measured by pressure @-@ volume loops in viv@@ o. this was associated with a reduced activation state of ak@@ t , as well as an increased b@@ ax / b@@ cl@@ 2 ratio in western blots , indicating cardiac apopto@@ si@@ s. furthermore , m@@ r@@ na levels of the proinflammatory cytokine interleukin 6 were increased in the cardiac tissu@@ e. in dox b@@ 1@@ r ( - / - ) mice , cardiac dysfunction was improved compared to dox control mice , which was associated with normalization of the b@@ ax / bcl @-@ 2 ratio and interleukin 6 , as well as ak@@ t activation stat@@ e. these findings suggest that b@@ 1@@ r is detrimental in dox cardiomyopathy in that it mediates the inflammatory response and apopto@@ si@@ s. these insights might have useful implications for future studies utilizing b@@ 1@@ r antagonists for treatment of human dox cardiomyopathy .
hepatotoxicity associated with sulf@@ asalazine in inflammatory arthritis : a case series from a local surveillance of serious adverse event@@ s. background : spontaneous reporting systems for adverse drug reactions ( ad@@ rs ) are handicapped by under @-@ reporting and limited detail on individual cas@@ es@@ . we report an investigation from a local surveillance for serious adverse drug reactions associated with disease modifying anti @-@ rheumatic drugs that was triggered by the occurrence of liver failure in two of our patient@@ s. methods : serious ad@@ r reports have been sol@@ ic@@ ited from local clinicians by regular post@@ cards over the past seven year@@ s. patients &apos; , who had hepatotoxicity on sulf@@ asalazine and met a definition of a serious ad@@ r , were identi@@ fi@@ ed@@ . two clinicians reviewed structured case reports and assessed causality by consensus and by using a causality assessment instrum@@ ent@@ . the likely frequency of hepatotoxicity with sulf@@ asalazine was estimated by making a series of conservative as@@ sump@@ tion@@ s. results : ten cases were identified : eight occurred during surve@@ ill@@ anc@@ e. eight patients were hospitalised , two in hepatic failure - one died after a liver transpl@@ ant@@ . all but one event occurred within 6 weeks of treat@@ ment@@ . seven patients had a skin rash , three eosinophilia and one interstitial neph@@ ri@@ tis@@ . five patients were of black bri@@ tish of af@@ r@@ ican or car@@ ib@@ bean des@@ cent@@ . liver enzymes showed a hepatocellular pattern in four cases and a mixed pattern in six@@ . drug @-@ related hepatotoxicity was judged probable or highly probable in 8 patient@@ s. the likely frequency of serious hepatotoxicity with sulf@@ asalazine was estimated at 0.4 % of treated patient@@ s. conclusion : serious hepatotoxicity associated with sulf@@ asalazine appears to be under @-@ appreciated and intensive monitoring and vigilance in the first 6 weeks of treatment is especially important .
an evaluation of amikacin nephrotoxicity in the hematology / oncology popul@@ ation@@ . amikacin is an aminoglycoside commonly used to provide empirical double gram @-@ negative treatment for febrile neutropenia and other suspected infec@@ tion@@ s. strategies of extended @-@ interval and conventional dosing have been utilized extensively in the general medical population ; however , data are lacking to support a dosing strategy in the hematology / oncology popul@@ ation@@ . to evaluate amikacin @-@ associated nephrotoxicity in an adult hematology / oncology population , a prospective , randomized , open @-@ label trial was conducted at a university @-@ affiliated medical c@@ enter@@ . forty patients with a diagnosis consistent with a hematologic / oncologic disorder that required treatment with an aminoglycoside were randomized to either conventional or extended @-@ interval amik@@ acin@@ . the occurrence of nephrotoxicity by means of an increase in serum creatinine and evaluation of efficacy via amikacin serum concentrations with respective pathogens were ass@@ es@@ sed@@ . the occurrence of nephrotoxicity was similar between the conventional and extended @-@ interval groups , at 10 % and 5 % , respectively ( p = 1.00 ) . six patients in the conventional group had a positive culture , compared with none in the extended @-@ interval group ( p = 0.002 ) . the occurrence of nephrotoxicity was similar between the two dosing regimens , but the distribution of risk factors was variable between the two grou@@ ps@@ . efficacy could not be assessed .
memory function and serotonin transporter promoter gene polymorphism in ec@@ st@@ asy ( md@@ ma ) us@@ er@@ s. although 3,4 @-@ methylenedi@@ oxy@@ methamphetamine ( md@@ ma or ec@@ st@@ asy ) has been shown to damage brain serotonin ( 5 @-@ h@@ t ) neurons in animals and possibly humans , little is known about the long @-@ term consequences of md@@ ma @-@ induced 5 @-@ h@@ t neurotoxic lesions on functions in which 5 @-@ h@@ t is involved , such as cognitive function@@ . because 5 @-@ h@@ t transporters play a key element in the regulation of synaptic 5 @-@ h@@ t transmission it may be important to control for the potential covariance effect of a polymorphism in the 5 @-@ h@@ t transporter promoter gene region ( 5 @-@ htt@@ lpr ) when studying the effects of md@@ ma as well as cognitive function@@ ing@@ . the aim of the study was to investigate the effects of moderate and heavy md@@ ma use on cognitive function , as well as the effects of long @-@ term ab@@ sten@@ tion from md@@ ma , in subjects genotyped for 5 @-@ htt@@ l@@ pr@@ . a second aim of the study was to determine whether these effects differ for females and mal@@ es@@ . fifteen moderate md@@ ma users ( &lt; 55 lifetime tablets ) , 22 heavy md@@ ma + users ( &gt; 55 lifetime tablets ) , 16 ex @-@ md@@ ma + users ( last tablet &gt; 1 year ago ) and 13 controls were compared on a battery of neuropsychological test@@ s. d@@ na from peripheral nuclear blood cells was genotyped for 5 @-@ htt@@ lpr using standard polymerase chain reaction method@@ s.@@ a significant group effect was observed only on memory function tasks ( p = 0.04 ) but not on reaction times ( p = 0.61 ) or attention / executive functioning ( p = 0.59 ) . heavy and ex @-@ md@@ ma + users performed significantly poorer on memory tasks than contro@@ l@@ s. in contrast , no evidence of memory impairment was observed in moderate md@@ ma us@@ er@@ s. no significant effect of 5 @-@ htt@@ lpr or gender was obser@@ ve@@ d. while the use of md@@ ma in quantities that may be considered &quot; moderate &quot; is not associated with impaired memory functioning , heavy use of md@@ ma use may lead to long lasting memory impair@@ ment@@ s. no effect of 5 @-@ htt@@ lpr or gender on memory function or md@@ ma use was observed .

nephrotoxic effects in high @-@ risk patients undergoing angi@@ og@@ rap@@ hy@@ . background : the use of iodinated contrast medium can result in nephro@@ path@@ y@@ . whether iso @-@ osmolar contrast medium is less nephrotoxic than low @-@ osmolar contrast medium in high @-@ risk patients is uncer@@ tain@@ . methods : we conducted a randomized , double @-@ blind , prospective , multicenter study comparing the nephrotoxic effects of an iso @-@ osmolar , dimeric , nonionic contrast medium , iodi@@ x@@ anol , with those of a low @-@ osmolar , nonionic , monomeric contrast medium , i@@ ohex@@ ol@@ . the study involved 129 patients with diabetes with serum creatinine concentrations of 1.5 to 3.5 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter who underwent coronary or aorto@@ femoral angi@@ og@@ rap@@ hy@@ . the primary end point was the peak increase from base line in the creatinine concentration during the three days after angi@@ og@@ rap@@ hy@@ . other end points were an increase in the creatinine concentration of 0.5 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter or more , an increase of 1.0 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter or more , and a change in the creatinine concentration from day 0 to day 7@@ . results : the creatinine concentration increased significantly less in patients who received iodi@@ x@@ an@@ ol@@ . from day 0 to day 3 , the mean peak increase in creatinine was 0.13 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter in the iodi@@ x@@ anol group and 0.55 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter in the i@@ ohex@@ ol group ( p = 0.001 ; the increase with iodi@@ x@@ anol minus the increase with i@@ ohex@@ ol , -0.@@ 42 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter &#91; 95 percent confidence interval , -@@ 0.73 to -0.@@ 22 &#93; ) . two of the 64 patients in the iodi@@ x@@ anol group ( 3 percent ) had an increase in the creatinine concentration of 0.5 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter or more , as compared with 17 of the 65 patients in the i@@ ohex@@ ol group ( 26 percent ) ( p = 0.002 ; odds ratio for such an increase in the iodi@@ x@@ anol group , 0.09 &#91; 95 percent confidence interval , 0.02 to 0.41 &#93; ) . no patient receiving iodi@@ x@@ anol had an increase of 1.0 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter or more , but 10 patients in the i@@ ohex@@ ol group ( 15 percent ) di@@ d. the mean change in the creatinine concentration from day 0 to day 7 was 0.07 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter in the iodi@@ x@@ anol group and 0.24 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter in the i@@ ohex@@ ol group ( p = 0.003 ; value in the iodi@@ x@@ anol group minus the value in the i@@ ohex@@ ol group , -0.@@ 17 mg per dec@@ il@@ iter &#91; 95 percent confidence interval , -0.@@ 34 to -@@ 0.07 &#93; ) . conclusions : nephropathy induced by contrast medium may be less likely to develop in high @-@ risk patients when iodi@@ x@@ anol is used rather than a low @-@ osmolar , nonionic contrast medium .
experimental cranial pain elicited by capsaicin : a pet stud@@ y@@ . using a positron emission tomography ( pet ) study it was shown recently that in migraine without aura certain areas in the brain stem were activated during the headache state , but not in the headache free inter@@ val@@ . it was suggested that this brain stem activation is inherent to the migraine attack itself and represents the so called &apos; migraine generator &apos; . to test this hypothesis we performed an experimental pain study in seven healthy volunteers , using the same positioning in the pet scanner as in the migraine patient@@ s. a small amount of capsaicin was administered subcutaneously in the right forehead to evoke a burning painful sensation in the first division of the trigeminal ner@@ ve@@ . increases of regional cerebral blood flow ( r@@ c@@ b@@ f ) were found bilaterally in the insula , in the anterior cingulate cortex , the cavernous sinus and the cerebell@@ um@@ . using the same stereotactic space limits as in the above mentioned migraine study no brain stem activation was found in the acute pain state compared to the pain free stat@@ e. the increase of activation in the region of the cavernous sinus however , suggests that this structure is more likely to be involved in trigeminal transmitted pain as such , rather than in a specific type of headache as was suggested for cluster headache .
neuroleptic malignant syndrome with ris@@ perid@@ on@@ e. neuroleptic malignant syndrome is thought to be a result of dopamine d2 receptor blockade in the striatum of the basal gangli@@ a. risperidone , a benz@@ is@@ oxazole derivative antipsychotic , has high serotonin 5 @-@ ht@@ 2 receptor blockade and dose @-@ related d2 receptor bloc@@ k@@ ade@@ . the high ratio is believed to im@@ part the low frequency of extrapyramidal symptoms with risperidone at low dos@@ ag@@ es@@ . with this low frequency of extrapyramidal symptoms , it was thought the frequency of neuroleptic malignant syndrome might also be low@@ ere@@ d. a 73 @-@ year @-@ old woman developed neuroleptic malignant syndrome after monotherapy with ris@@ perid@@ on@@ e. the syndrome reversed after discontinuing risperidone and starting treatment with dan@@ tro@@ l@@ ene and brom@@ ocrip@@ ti@@ ne@@ . it appears that the protection from extrapyramidal side effects observed with risperidone does not ensure protection from neuroleptic malignant syndrome .
hepatic and extrahepatic angiotensinogen gene expression in rats with acute nephrotic syn@@ dro@@ me@@ . plasma concentration and urine excretion of the renin @-@ angiotensin system proteins are altered in rats with nephrotic syndrome ( ns ) . in this work the messenger ribonucleic acid ( m@@ r@@ na ) levels of angiotensinogen ( ao ) were analyzed with the s@@ lot @-@ blot hybridization technique in liver and other extrahepatic tissues : kidney , heart , brain , and adrenal gland from control , nephrotic , and pair @-@ fed ( p@@ f ) rat@@ s. ns was induced by a single injection of puromycin amino @-@ nucleoside ( pan ) . although a great urinary excretion and half @-@ normal plasma levels of ao were observed on day 6 after pan injection , when ns was clearly established , hepatic ao m@@ r@@ na levels did not chang@@ e. furthermore , the ao m@@ r@@ na levels did not change in any of the extrahepatic tissues studied on day 6 , nor did its hepatic levels at days 1 , 3 , 5 , or 7 after pan injec@@ tion@@ . these data suggest that the hepatic and extrahepatic ao m@@ r@@ na levels are unaltered during the development of the acute ns induced by pan .

acute blood pressure elevations with caffeine in men with borderline systemic hyper@@ ten@@ sion@@ . whether the vasoconstric@@ tive actions of caffeine are enhanced in hypertensive persons has not been demonstr@@ ated@@ . thus , caffeine ( 3.3 mg / kg ) versus placebo was tested in 48 healthy men ( aged 20 to 35 years ) selected after screening on 2 separate occa@@ sion@@ s. borderline hypertensive men ( n = 24 ) were selected with screening systolic blood pressure ( bp ) of 140 to 160 mm h@@ g and / or diastolic bp 90 to 99 mm h@@ g. low @-@ risk controls ( n = 24 ) reported no parental history of hypertension and had screening bp &lt; 130 / 85 mm h@@ g. participants were then tested on 2 occasions after 12 @-@ hour abstinence from caffeine in each of 2 protocols ; this required a total of 4 laboratory vis@@ it@@ s. caffeine @-@ induced changes in diastolic bp were 2 to 3 times larger in borderline subjects than in controls ( + 8.4 vs + 3.8 mm h@@ g , p &lt; 0.0001 ) , and were attributable to larger changes in impedance @-@ derived measures of systemic vascular resistance ( + 135 vs + 45 dyn@@ es.@@ s.@@ cm @-@ 5 , p &lt; 0.004 ) . these findings were consistent and reached significance in both protoc@@ ol@@ s. the percentage of borderline subjects in whom diastolic bp changes exceeded the median control response was 96 % . consequently , whereas all participants exhibited normotensive levels during the resting pre@@ drug baseline , 33 % of borderline subjects achieved hypertensive bp levels after caffeine ing@@ estion@@ . thus , in borderline hypertensive men , exaggerated responses to caffeine were : selective for diastolic bp , consistent with greater vasoconstriction , replicated in 2 protocols , and representative of nearly all borderline hyper@@ tensi@@ v@@ es@@ . we suspect that the potential for caffeine to stabilize high resistance states in susceptible persons suggests that its use may facilitate their disease progression , as well as hinder accurate diagnosis and treatment .

adequate timing of ribavirin reduction in patients with hemolysis during combination therapy of interferon and ribavirin for chronic hepatitis c. background : hemolytic anemia is one of the major adverse events of the combination therapy of interferon and rib@@ avir@@ in@@ . because of ribavirin @-@ related hemolytic anemia , dose reduction is a common event in this therap@@ y@@ . in this clinical retrospective cohort study we have examined the suitable timing of ribavirin reduction in patients with hemolysis during combination therap@@ y@@ . methods : thirty @-@ seven of 160 patients who had h@@ cv @-@ genotype 1b , had high virus load , and received 24 @-@ week combination therapy developed anemia with hemoglobin level &lt; 10 g / dl or anemia @-@ related signs during therap@@ y@@ . after that , these 37 patients were reduced one tablet of ribavirin ( 200 mg ) per day@@ . after reduction of ribavirin , 27 of 37 patients could continue combination therapy for a total of 24 weeks ( group a ) . however , 10 of 37 patients with reduction of ribavirin could not continue combination therapy because their &lt; 8.5 g / dl hemoglobin values decreased to or anemia @-@ related severe side effects occurred ( group b ) . we assessed the final efficacy and safety after reduction of ribavirin in groups a and b@@ . results : a sustained virological response ( s@@ v@@ r ) was 29.6 % ( 8 / 27 ) in group a and 10 % ( 1 / 10 ) in group b , respec@@ ti@@ vel@@ y@@ . a 34.4 % ( 12 / 27 ) of s@@ v@@ r + biological response in group a was higher than 10 % ( 1 / 10 ) in group b ( p = 0.0@@ 51 ) , with slight signific@@ anc@@ e. with respect to hemoglobin level at the time of ribavirin reduction , a rate of continuation of therapy in patients with &gt; or = 10 g / dl hemoglobin was higher than that in patients with &lt; 10 g / dl ( p = 0.036 ) . conclusions : reduction of ribavirin at hemoglobin level &gt; or = 10 g / dl is suitable in terms of efficacy and side effects .
increased expression and apical targeting of renal en@@ ac subunits in puromycin amin@@ onucle@@ oside @-@ induced nephrotic syndrome in rat@@ s. nephrotic syndrome is often accompanied by sodium retention and generalized ede@@ ma@@ . however , the molecular basis for the decreased renal sodium excretion remains un@@ defin@@ ed@@ . we hypothesized that epithelial na channel ( en@@ ac ) subunit dysregulation may be responsible for the increased sodium ret@@ enti@@ on@@ . an experimental group of rats was treated with puromycin amin@@ onucle@@ oside ( pan ; 180 mg / kg iv ) , whereas the control group received only veh@@ ic@@ le@@ . after 7 days , pan treatment induced significant proteinuria , hypoalbumin@@ emia , decreased urinary sodium excretion , and extensive asc@@ it@@ es@@ . the protein abundance of alpha @-@ en@@ ac and beta @-@ en@@ ac was increased in the inner stripe of the outer medulla ( is@@ om ) and in the inner medulla ( im ) but was not altered in the cor@@ tex@@ . gamma @-@ en@@ ac abundance was increased in the cortex , is@@ om , and im@@ . immunoperoxidase br@@ ight@@ fi@@ el@@ d- and laser @-@ scanning confocal fluorescence microscopy demonstrated increased targeting of alpha @-@ en@@ ac , beta @-@ en@@ ac , and gamma @-@ en@@ ac subunits to the apical plasma membrane in the distal convoluted tubule ( d@@ ct@@ 2 ) , connecting tubule , and cortical and medullary collecting duct segment@@ s. immunoelectron microscopy further revealed an increased labeling of alpha @-@ en@@ ac in the apical plasma membrane of cortical collecting duct principal cells of pan @-@ treated rats , indicating enhanced apical targeting of alpha @-@ en@@ ac sub@@ un@@ it@@ s. in contrast , the protein abundances of na ( + ) / h ( + ) exchanger type 3 ( n@@ he@@ 3 ) , na ( + ) -@@ k ( + ) -2@@ cl ( - ) cotransporter ( b@@ sc @-@ 1 ) , and thiazide @-@ sensitive na ( + ) -@@ cl ( - ) cotransporter ( ts@@ c ) were decre@@ as@@ ed@@ . moreover , the abundance of the alpha ( 1 ) -@@ subunit of the na @-@ k @-@ at@@ p@@ ase was decreased in the cortex and is@@ om , but it remained unchanged in the im@@ . in conclusion , the increased or sustained expression of en@@ ac subunits combined with increased apical targeting in the d@@ ct@@ 2 , connecting tubule , and collecting duct are likely to play a role in the sodium retention associated with pan @-@ induced nephrotic syn@@ dro@@ me@@ . the decreased abundance of n@@ he@@ 3 , b@@ sc @-@ 1 , ts@@ c , and na @-@ k @-@ at@@ p@@ ase may play a compensatory role to promote sodium excretion .
does hormone therapy for the treatment of breast cancer have a detrimental effect on memory and cognition ? a pilot stud@@ y@@ . this pilot study examines whether hormone therapy for breast cancer affects cogn@@ iti@@ on@@ . patients participating in a randomised trial of an@@ astro@@ zole , tamoxifen alone or combined ( at@@ ac ) ( n = 94 ) and a group of women without breast cancer ( n = 35 ) completed a battery of neuropsychological measu@@ res@@ . compared with the control group , the patients were impaired on a processing speed task ( p = 0.032 ) and on a measure of immediate verbal memory ( p = 0.026 ) after controlling for the use of hormone replacement therapy in both grou@@ ps@@ . patient group performance was not significantly related to length of treatment or measures of psychological morb@@ id@@ it@@ y@@ . the results showed specific impairments in processing speed and verbal memory in women receiving hormonal therapy for the treatment of breast cancer@@ . verbal memory may be especially sensitive to changes in oestrogen levels , a finding commonly reported in studies of hormone replacement therapy in healthy wom@@ en@@ . in view of the increased use of hormone therapies in an adjuvant and preventative setting their impact on cognitive functioning should be investigated more thoroughly .
association of nitric oxide production and apoptosis in a model of experimental nephro@@ path@@ y@@ . background : in recent studies increased amounts of nitric oxide ( no ) and apoptosis have been implicated in various pathological conditions in the kidne@@ y@@ . we have studied the role of no and its association with apoptosis in an experimental model of nephrotic syndrome induced by a single injection of adriamycin ( ad@@ r ) . methods : the alteration in the no pathway was assessed by measuring nitrite levels in serum / urine and by evaluating the changes in vascular reactivity of the isolated perfused rat kidney ( ipr@@ k ) system@@ . rats were stratified into control groups and ad@@ r @-@ induced nephropathy grou@@ ps@@ . these two groups were then divided into : group 1 , animals receiving saline ; and group 2 , animals receiving amin@@ oguanidine ( ag ) which is a specific inhibitor of inducible @-@ no synth@@ as@@ e. on day 21 , rats were sacrificed after obtaining material for biochemical analy@@ si@@ s. results : histopathological examination of the kidneys of rats treated with ad@@ r revealed focal areas of mesangial proliferation and mild tubulointerstitial inflam@@ m@@ ation@@ . they also had significantly higher levels of proteinuria compared with control and treatment groups ( p &lt; 0.05 ) . urine nitrite levels were significantly increased in the ad@@ r @-@ nephropathy group ( p &lt; 0.05 ) . in the ipr@@ k phenylephrine and acetylcholine related responses were significantly impaired in the ad@@ r @-@ nephropathy grou@@ p. apoptosis was not detected in contro@@ l@@ s. however , in the ad@@ r @-@ nephropathy group , numerous apoptotic cells were identified in the tubulointerstitial are@@ as@@ . double staining revealed numerous interstitial apoptotic cells to stain for ed@@ 1 , a marker for monocytes / macroph@@ ag@@ es@@ . treatment with ag prevented the impairment of renal vascular bed responses and reduced both urine nitrite levels and apoptosis to control lev@@ el@@ s. conclusion : we suggest that interactions between no and apoptosis are important in the pathogenesis of the ad@@ r @-@ induced neph@@ rosis .
the attenuating effect of car@@ te@@ olol hydrochloride , a beta @-@ adrenoceptor antagonist , on neuroleptic @-@ induced catal@@ epsy in rat@@ s. it is known that beta @-@ adrenoceptor antagonists are effective in the treatment of ak@@ athi@@ sia , one of the extrapyramidal side effects that occur during neuroleptic treat@@ ment@@ . neuroleptic @-@ induced catal@@ epsy , a model of neuroleptic @-@ induced extrapyramidal side effects , was considered suitable as a model for predicting neuroleptic @-@ induced ak@@ athi@@ sia in humans , although neuroleptic @-@ induced catal@@ epsy was not considered a specific test for neuroleptic @-@ induced ak@@ athi@@ si@@ a. therefore , the effects of car@@ te@@ olol , a beta @-@ adrenoceptor antagonist , on haloperidol @-@ induced catal@@ epsy in rats were behaviorally studied and compared with those of propranolol and bi@@ peri@@ den , a muscarinic receptor antagon@@ ist@@ . car@@ te@@ olol , as well as propranolol and bi@@ peri@@ den , inhibited the haloperidol @-@ induced catal@@ ep@@ sy@@ . the inhibitory effect of car@@ te@@ olol was almost comparable to that of propranolol , but was weaker than that of bi@@ per@@ iden@@ . car@@ te@@ olol did not evoke postsynaptic dopamine receptor @-@ stimulating behavioral signs such as stere@@ otypy and hyper@@ locomotion in rat@@ s. car@@ te@@ olol did not antagonize the inhibitory effects of haloperidol on apomorphine @-@ induced stere@@ otypy and locomotor activity in rat@@ s. in addition , car@@ te@@ olol did not evoke 5 @-@ ht@@ 1a receptor @-@ stimulating behavioral signs such as flat body posture and fore@@ paw tre@@ ading and did not inhibit 5 @-@ hydroxy@@ tryptophan @-@ induced head twitch in rat@@ s. finally , car@@ te@@ olol did not inhibit physostigmine @-@ induced lethality in rat@@ s. these results strongly suggest that car@@ te@@ olol improves haloperidol @-@ induced catal@@ epsy via its beta @-@ adrenoceptor antagonistic activity and is expected to be effective in the treatment of ak@@ athi@@ sia without attenuating neuroleptic @-@ induced antipsychotic effects due to its postsynaptic dopamine receptor antagonistic activity .
penicillamine @-@ induced rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis in a patient with rheumatoid arth@@ ri@@ tis@@ . a 67 @-@ year @-@ old woman with rheumatoid arthritis presented rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis ( rp@@ gn ) after 5 months of d @-@ penicillamine ( 250 mg / day ) treat@@ ment@@ . light microscopy study showed severe glomerulonephritis with cresc@@ ent formation in 60 % of the glomeruli and infiltration of inflammatory cells in the wall of an arteri@@ ol@@ e. immunofluorescence revealed sc@@ ant@@ y granular ig@@ g , ig@@ a and c@@ 3 deposits along the capillary walls and mes@@ angi@@ um@@ . the patient was treated with steroid pulse , plasmapheresis , cyclophosphamide and antiplatelet ag@@ ent@@ s. a complete recovery of renal function was achieved in a few week@@ s. this new case of rp@@ gn in the course of d @-@ penicillamine treatment emphasizes the need for frequent monitoring of renal function and evaluation of urinary sediment and proteinuria in these patient@@ s. the prompt discontinuation of d @-@ penicillamine and vigorous treatment measures could allow for a good prognosis as in this case .

effects of umb@@ 24 and ( + / - ) -@@ s@@ m 21 , putative sigma@@ 2 @-@ preferring antagonists , on behavioral toxic and stimulant effects of cocaine in mic@@ e. earlier studies have demonstrated that antagonism of sigma@@ 1 receptors attenuates the convulsive , lethal , locomotor stimulatory and rewarding actions of cocaine in mic@@ e. in contrast , the contribution of sigma@@ 2 receptors is unclear because experimental tools to selectively target this subtype are un@@ avail@@ ab@@ le@@ . to begin addressing this need , we characterized umb@@ 24 ( 1- ( 2 @-@ phen@@ ethyl ) -@@ 4- ( 2 @-@ pyridyl ) -@@ piperazine ) and ( + / - ) -@@ s@@ m 21 ( 3alpha @-@ tro@@ pan@@ yl @-@ 2- ( 4 @-@ choro@@ phenoxy ) butyrate ) in receptor binding and behavioral studi@@ es@@ . receptor binding studies confirmed that umb@@ 24 and ( + / - ) -@@ s@@ m 21 display preferential affinity for sigma@@ 2 over sigma@@ 1 recep@@ tor@@ s. in behavioral studies , pretreatment of sw@@ iss web@@ ster mice with umb@@ 24 or ( + / - ) -@@ s@@ m 21 significantly attenuated cocaine @-@ induced convulsions and locomotor activity , but not le@@ thal@@ it@@ y@@ . when administered alone , ( + / - ) -@@ s@@ m 21 produced no significant effects compared to control injections of saline , but umb@@ 24 had locomotor depressant action@@ s. together , the data suggest that sigma@@ 2 receptor antagonists have the potential to attenuate some of the behavioral effects of cocaine , and further development of more selective , high affinity ligands are warranted .
meth@@ im@@ azole @-@ induced cholestatic jaun@@ dic@@ e. meth@@ im@@ azole is a widely used and generally well @-@ tolerated anti@@ thyroid ag@@ ent@@ . a 43 @-@ year @-@ old woman had severe jaundice and itching 1 month after receiving meth@@ im@@ azole ( 10 mg tid ) and propranolol ( 20 mg tid ) for treatment of hyper@@ thyro@@ i@@ dis@@ m. the patient continued treatment for another 4 days after the appearance of jaundice until she finished both medic@@ ation@@ s. when seen at the emergency department 2 weeks later , she still had severe ic@@ ter@@ us , pruritus , and hyperbilirubinemia , formed mainly of the conjugated fraction@@ . meth@@ im@@ azole @-@ induced cholestasis was diagnosed , and propranolol therapy was res@@ u@@ med@@ . over the following 9 days , the symptoms improved and plasma bilirubin levels were normal after 12 weeks without meth@@ im@@ azol@@ e. in rare cases within the first few weeks of therapy , this drug can cause severe and reversible cholestatic jaun@@ dic@@ e. physicians and patients should be aware of this adverse effect so that , upon occurrence , they can dis@@ continue meth@@ im@@ azole therapy and avoid unnecessary invasive procedures .

vasopressin in the treatment of mil@@ rinone @-@ induced hypotension in severe heart fail@@ ure@@ . the use of phosphodiesterase inhibitors such as mil@@ rinone in the treatment of severe heart failure is frequently restricted because they cause vasodilation and hypot@@ en@@ sion@@ . in patients with decompensated heart failure with hypotension after treatment with mil@@ rinone , low doses of vasopressin restored blood pressure without inhibiting the inotropic effect of mil@@ rinone .
halogenated anesthetics form liver adducts and antigens that cross @-@ react with halothane @-@ induced anti@@ bodi@@ es@@ . two halogenated anesthetics , enflurane and isoflurane , have been associated with an allergic @-@ type hepatic injury both alone and following previous exposure to hal@@ oth@@ ane@@ . halothane hepatitis appears to involve an aberrant immune respon@@ se@@ . an antibody response to a protein @-@ bound biotransformation product ( trifluoro@@ acetyl adduct ) has been detected on halothane hepatitis patient@@ s. this study was performed to determine cross @-@ reactivity between enflurane and isoflurane with the hypersensitivity induced by hal@@ oth@@ ane@@ . the subcellular and lobular production of hepatic neo@@ antigens recognized by halothane @-@ induced antibodies following enflurane and isoflurane , and the biochemical nature of these neo@@ antigens was investigated in two animal mod@@ el@@ s. enflurane administration resulted in neo@@ antigens detected in both the microsomal and cytosolic fraction of liver homogenates and in the centr@@ il@@ obular region of the li@@ ver@@ . in the same liver , biochemical analysis detected fluorinated liver adducts that were up to 20 @-@ fold greater in guinea pigs than in rat@@ s. this supports and extends previous evidence for a mechanism by which enflurane and / or isoflurane could produce a hypersensitivity condition similar to that of halothane hepatitis either alone or subsequent to halothane administr@@ ation@@ . the guinea pig would appear to be a useful model for further investigations of the immunological response to these antigens .
induction by paracetamol of bladder and liver tumours in the rat@@ . effects on hepatocyte fine struc@@ ture@@ . groups of male and female inbred le@@ eds strain rats were fed diets containing either 0.5 % or 1.0 % paracetamol by weight for up to 18 mon@@ th@@ s. at the 1.0 % dosage level , 20 % of rats of both sexes developed neoplastic nodules of the liver , a statistically significant incid@@ enc@@ e. these rats also showed gross enlargement of their livers and an increase in foci of cellular alteration , the latter also being observed in the low dosage male rat@@ s. papillomas of the transitional epithelium of the bladder developed in all paracetamol @-@ treated groups , and three rats bore bladder carcin@@ omas@@ . however , significant yields of bladder tumours were only obtained from low dosage females and high dosage mal@@ es@@ . additionally , 20 to 25 % of paracetamol @-@ treated rats developed hyperplasia of the bladder epithelium , which was not coincident with the presence of bladder calcul@@ i. a low yield of tumours at various other sites also arose following paracetamol feed@@ ing@@ . an electron microscope study of the livers of paracetamol @-@ treated rats revealed ultrastructural changes in the hepatocytes that resemble those that result from exposure to a variety of known hepatocarcin@@ ogens .
rat extraocular muscle re@@ gener@@ ation@@ . repair of local anesthetic @-@ induced dam@@ ag@@ e. local anesthetics that are commonly used in ophthalmic surgery ( 0.75 % bupivacaine hydrochloride , 2.0 % me@@ piv@@ ac@@ aine hydrochloride , and 2.0 % lidocaine hydrochloride plus 1 : 100,000 epinephrine ) were injected into the retro@@ bulbar area of rat ey@@ es@@ . controls were injected with physiological sal@@ ine@@ . all three anesthetics produced massive degeneration of the extraocular mus@@ cl@@ es@@ . muscle degeneration is followed by regeneration of the damaged muscle fiber@@ s. in addition to muscle damage , severe damage was also seen in har@@ deri@@ an glands , especially after exposure to me@@ piv@@ ac@@ aine and lidocaine plus ep@@ in@@ eph@@ r@@ ine@@ . with these findings in rats , it is hypothesized that the temporary diplopia sometimes seen in patients after ophthalmic surgery might be due to anesthetic @-@ induced damage to the extraocular muscles .

diazepam facilitates reflex bradycardia in conscious rat@@ s. the effects of diazepam on cardiovascular function were assessed in conscious rat@@ s. intravenous administration of diazepam ( 1 @-@ 30 mg kg @-@ 1 ) produced a dose @-@ dependent decrease in both the mean arterial pressure and the heart rat@@ e. also , reflex bradycardia was produced in rats by intravenous infusion of adrenaline ( 1.25 @-@ 2.5 micrograms kg @-@ 1 ) . intravenous pretreatment of the rats with diazepam , although causing no change in the adrenaline @-@ induced pressor effect , did enhance the adrenaline @-@ induced reflex brady@@ cardi@@ a. however , the diazepam enhancement of adrenaline @-@ induced reflex bradycardia was antagonized by pretreatment of rats with an intravenous dose of picro@@ toxin ( an agent blocks chloride channels by binding to sites associated with the benzodiazepine @-@ gab@@ a @-@ chloride channel macromolecular complex ) . the data indicate that diazepam acts through the benzodiazepine @-@ gab@@ a @-@ chloride channel macromolecular complex within the central nervous system to facilitate reflex bradycardia mediated through baroreceptor reflexes in response to an acute increase in arterial pressure .
chronic carbamazepine inhibits the development of local anesthetic seizures kindled by cocaine and lid@@ oc@@ ain@@ e. the effects of carbamazepine ( c@@ b@@ z ) treatment on local anesthetic @-@ kindled seizures and lethality were evaluated in different stages of the kindling process and under different methods of c@@ b@@ z administr@@ ation@@ . chronic oral c@@ b@@ z inhibited the development of both lid@@ oc@@ ain@@ e- and cocaine @-@ induced seizures , but had little effect on the fully developed local anesthetic seiz@@ u@@ res@@ . chronic c@@ b@@ z also decreased the incidence of seizure @-@ related mortality in the cocaine @-@ injected rat@@ s. acute c@@ b@@ z over a range of doses ( 15 @-@ 50 mg / kg ) had no effect on completed lidocaine @-@ kindled or acute cocaine @-@ induced seiz@@ u@@ res@@ . repeated i.p. injection of c@@ b@@ z ( 15 mg / kg ) also was without effect on the development of lid@@ oc@@ ain@@ e- or cocaine @-@ kindled seiz@@ u@@ res@@ . the differential effects of c@@ b@@ z depending upon stage of seizure development suggest that distinct mechanisms underlie the development versus maintenance of local anesthetic @-@ kindled seiz@@ u@@ res@@ . the effectiveness of chronic but not repeated , intermittent injections of c@@ b@@ z suggests that different biochemical consequences result from the different treatment reg@@ im@@ ens@@ . the possible utility of chronic c@@ b@@ z in preventing the development of toxic side effects in human cocaine users is suggested by these data , but remains to be directly evaluated .

sirolimus and mycophenolate mofetil for calcineurin @-@ free immunosuppression in renal transplant recipi@@ ent@@ s. calcineurin inhibitors , such as cyclosporine and tacrolimus , have been available for almost 20 year@@ s. although these drugs are highly effective and represent the mainstay of transplant immunosuppression , they are associated with acute and chronic nephro@@ toxic@@ it@@ y@@ . acute nephrotoxicity , which occurs in the early period after transplantation , leads to a higher rate of dialysis , and chronic nephrotoxicity may eventually result in graft los@@ s. acute and chronic nephrotoxicity is becoming more common as the use of marginal kidneys for transplantation incre@@ as@@ es@@ . two recently available immunosuppressive agents , mycophenolate mofetil and sirolimus ( rapamycin ) , have no nephro@@ toxic@@ it@@ y@@ . the use of these drugs in combination with other agents has led to the development of new paradigms of immunosuppressive therap@@ y@@ . this paper reviews the results of clinical trials that have investigated these new approaches to immunosuppression in renal transplant recipients .
erythropoietin restores the anemia @-@ induced reduction in cyclophosphamide cytotoxicity in rat tumor@@ s. the aim of this study was to examine the impact of anemia prevention by recombinant human erythropoietin ( rh@@ u@@ ep@@ o ) treatment on the cytotoxicity of cyclophosphamide in solid experimental tumor@@ s. anemia was induced using a single dose of carboplatin ( 50 mg / kg i.v. ) resulting in a long @-@ lasting reduction ( 30 % ) of the hemoglobin concentr@@ ation@@ . in a second group , the development of anemia was prevented by rh@@ u@@ ep@@ o ( 1000 i@@ u / kg ) administered s.c. three times / week starting 7 days before carboplatin applic@@ ation@@ . four days after carboplatin treatment , tumors ( ds @-@ sarcoma of the rat ) were implanted s.c. onto the hind food dor@@ sum@@ . neither carboplatin nor rh@@ u@@ ep@@ o treatment influenced tumor growth rate per se@@ . when tumors were treated with a single dose of cyclophosphamide ( 60 mg / kg i.p. ) 5 days after implantation , a growth delay with a subsequent regrowth of the tumors was obser@@ ve@@ d. in the anemia group , the growth delay was significantly shorter compared with non@@ anemic controls ( 13.3 days versus 8.6 days ) . in the group where anemia was prevented by rh@@ u@@ ep@@ o treatment , growth delay was comparable with that of non@@ anemic controls ( 13.3 days ) . these results suggest that chemotherapy @-@ induced anemia reduces cytotoxicity of cyclophosphamide in tumors , whereas correction of anemia by rh@@ u@@ ep@@ o treatment ( epo@@ etin alpha ) increases the sensitivity , probably as a result of an improved oxygen supply to tumor tissue .

effects of the hippocampal deep brain stimulation on cortical epileptic discharges in penicillin - induced epilepsy model in rat@@ s. aim : experimental and clinical studies have revealed that hippocampal d@@ bs can control epileptic activity , but the mechanism of action is obscure and optimal stimulation parameters are not clearly defin@@ ed@@ . the aim was to evaluate the effects of high frequency hippocampal stimulation on cortical epileptic activity in penicillin @-@ induced epilepsy mod@@ el@@ . material and methods : twenty @-@ five sp@@ rag@@ ue @-@ d@@ aw@@ ley rats were implanted d@@ bs electro@@ des@@ . in group @-@ 1 ( n = 10 ) hippocampal d@@ bs was off and in the group @-@ 2 ( n = 10 ) hippocampal d@@ bs was on ( 185 h@@ z , 0.5@@ v , 1@@ v , 2@@ v , and 5@@ v for 60 sec ) following penicillin g injection intracor@@ tic@@ all@@ y@@ . in the control group hippocampal d@@ bs was on following 8 l saline injection intracor@@ tic@@ all@@ y@@ . e@@ eg recordings were obtained before and 15 minutes following penicillin @-@ g injection , and at 10th minutes following each stimulus for analysis in terms of frequency , amplitude , and power spectr@@ um@@ . results : high frequency hippocampal d@@ bs suppressed the acute penicillin @-@ induced cortical epileptic activity independent from stimulus inten@@ sit@@ y@@ . in the control group , hippocampal stimulation alone lead only to diffuse slowing of cerebral bioelectrical activity at 5@@ v stimul@@ ation@@ . conclusion : our results revealed that continuous high frequency stimulation of the hippocampus suppressed acute cortical epileptic activity effectively without causing secondary epileptic dis@@ charg@@ es@@ . these results are important in terms of defining the optimal parameters of hippocampal d@@ bs in patients with epilepsy .
neural correlates of s @-@ ketamine induced psychosis during overt continuous verbal flu@@ enc@@ y@@ . the glutamatergic n @-@ methyl @-@ d @-@ aspartate ( nm@@ da ) receptor has been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophren@@ i@@ a. administered to healthy volunteers , a sub@@ anesthetic dose of the non @-@ competitive nm@@ da receptor antagonist ketamine leads to psychopathological symptoms similar to those observed in schizophren@@ i@@ a. in patients with schizophrenia , ketamine exacerbates the core symptoms of illness , supporting the hypothesis of a glutamatergic dys@@ function@@ . in a counter@@ balanced , placebo @-@ controlled , double @-@ blind study design , healthy subjects were administered a continuous sub@@ anesthetic s @-@ ketamine infusion while differences in b@@ old responses measured with f@@ m@@ ri were detec@@ te@@ d. during the scanning period , subjects performed continuous overt verbal fluency tasks ( phonological , lexical and semantic ) . ketamine @-@ induced psychopathological symptoms were assessed with the positive and negative syndrome scale ( pan@@ ss ) . ketamine elicited psychosis like psych@@ opath@@ olog@@ y@@ . post @-@ hoc t @-@ tests revealed significant differences between placebo and ketamine for the amounts of words generated during lexical and semantic verbal fluency , while the phonological domain remained un@@ aff@@ ec@@ te@@ d. ketamine led to enhanced cortical activations in supram@@ arg@@ inal and frontal brain regions for phonological and lexical verbal fluency , but not for semantic verbal flu@@ enc@@ y@@ . ketamine induces activation changes in healthy subjects similar to those observed in patients with schizophrenia , particularly in frontal and temporal brain regi@@ on@@ s. our results provide further support for the hypothesis of an nm@@ da receptor dysfunction in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia .
dopamine is not essential for the development of methamphetamine @-@ induced neuro@@ toxic@@ it@@ y@@ . it is widely believed that dopamine ( da ) mediates methamphetamine ( meth ) -induced toxicity to brain dopaminergic neurons , because drugs that interfere with da neurotransmission decrease toxicity , whereas drugs that increase da neurotransmission enhance toxic@@ it@@ y@@ . however , temperature effects of drugs that have been used to manipulate brain da neurotransmission con@@ found interpretation of the dat@@ a. here we show that the recently reported ability of l @-@ dihydroxy@@ phenylalanine to reverse the protective effect of alpha @-@ methyl @-@ para @-@ tyrosine on meth @-@ induced da neurotoxicity is also confounded by drug effects on body temper@@ at@@ ure@@ . further , we show that mice genetically engineered to be deficient in brain da develop meth neurotoxicity , as long as the thermic effects of meth are preser@@ ve@@ d. in addition , we demonstrate that mice genetically engineered to have unilateral brain da deficits develop meth @-@ induced dopaminergic deficits that are of comparable magnitude on both sides of the bra@@ in@@ . taken together , these findings demonstrate that da is not essential for the development of meth @-@ induced dopaminergic neurotoxicity and suggest that mechanisms independent of da warrant more intense investigation .

cardiac arrest after intravenous metoclopramide - a case of five repeated injections of metoclopramide causing five episodes of cardiac ar@@ rest@@ . we describe a patient where intravenous injection of metoclopramide was immediately followed by as@@ yst@@ ole repeat@@ ed@@ ly@@ . the patient received metoclopramide 10 mg i.v. five times during 48 h@@ . after interviewing the attending nurses and reviewing the written documentation , it is clear that every administration of metoclopramide was immediately ( within s ) followed by as@@ yst@@ ol@@ e. the as@@ yst@@ ole lasted 15 @-@ 30 s on four occasions , on one occasion it lasted 2 min@@ . the patient received atropine 0.5 @-@ 1 mg and chest com@@ pressions , before sinus rhythm again took over@@ . we interpret this as episodes of cardiac arrest caused by met@@ ocl@@ op@@ ram@@ ide@@ . the rapid injection via the central venous route and the concomitant tapering of dopamine infusion might have contributed in precipitating the adverse drug reaction .

cauda equ@@ ina syndrome after spinal anaesthesia with hyperbaric 5 % lign@@ ocaine : a review of six cases of cauda equ@@ ina syndrome reported to the swe@@ dish pharmaceutical insurance 1993 @-@ 199@@ 7@@ . six cases of cauda equ@@ ina syndrome with varying severity were reported to the swe@@ dish pharmaceutical insurance during the period 1993 @-@ 199@@ 7@@ . all were associated with spinal anaesthesia using hyperbaric 5 % lignoc@@ ain@@ e. five cases had single @-@ shot spinal anaesthesia and one had a repeat spinal anaesthetic due to inadequate bloc@@ k@@ . the dose of hyperbaric 5 % lign@@ ocaine administered ranged from 60 to 120 m@@ g. three of the cases were most likely caused by direct neurotoxicity of hyperbaric 5 % lignoc@@ ain@@ e. in the other 3 cases , direct neurotoxicity was also probable , but unfortunately radiological investigations were not done to definitely exclude a compressive a@@ eti@@ olog@@ y@@ . all cases sustained permanent neurological defic@@ it@@ s. we recommend that hyperbaric lign@@ ocaine should be administered in concentrations not greater than 2 % and at a total dose preferably not exceeding 60 mg .
cortical motor over@@ activation in parkinsonian patients with l @-@ dopa @-@ induced peak @-@ dose dys@@ kine@@ si@@ a. we have studied the regional cerebral blood flow ( r@@ c@@ b@@ f ) changes induced by the execution of a finger @-@ to @-@ thumb op@@ position motor task in the supplementary and primary motor cortex of two groups of parkinsonian patients on l @-@ dopa medication , the first one without l @-@ dopa induced dyskinesia ( n = 23 ) and the other with moderate peak @-@ dose dyskinesia ( n = 15 ) , and of a group of 14 normal subjec@@ ts@@ . single photon emission tomography with i.v. 13@@ 3@@ x@@ e was used to measure the r@@ c@@ b@@ f chang@@ es@@ . the dys@@ kinetic parkinsonian patients exhibited a pattern of response which was markedly different from those of the normal subjects and non @-@ dys@@ kinetic parkinsonian patients , with a significant over@@ activation in the supplementary motor area and the ipsi@@ - and contralateral primary motor are@@ as@@ . these results are compatible with the hypothesis that an hyper@@ kinetic abnormal involuntary movement , like l @-@ dopa @-@ induced peak dose dyskinesia , is due to a dis@@ inhibition of the primary and associated motor cortex secondary to an excessive outflow of the pall@@ id@@ oth@@ al@@ am@@ ocortical motor loop .
dexamethasone @-@ induced ocular hypertension in perfusion @-@ cultured human ey@@ es@@ . purpose : glucocorticoid administration can lead to the development of ocular hypertension and corticosteroid glaucoma in a subset of the population through a decrease in the aqueous humor outflow facilit@@ y@@ . the purpose of this study was to determine whether glucocorticoid treatment can directly affect the outflow facility of isolated , perfusion @-@ cultured human ey@@ es@@ . methods : the anterior segments of human donor eyes from regional eye banks were placed in a constant flow , variable pressure perfusion culture system@@ . paired eyes were perfused in serum @-@ free media with or without 10 ( -7 ) m dexamethasone for 12 day@@ s. intraocular pressure was monitored d@@ ail@@ y@@ . after incubation , the eyes were morphologically characterized by light microscopy , transmission and scanning electron microscopy , and scanning laser confocal microscop@@ y@@ . results : a significant increase in intraocular pressure developed in 13 of the 44 pairs of eyes perfused with dexamethasone with an average pressure rise of 17.5 + / - 3.8 mm h@@ g after 12 days of dexamethasone expos@@ ure@@ . the contralateral control eyes , which did not receive dexamethasone , maintained a stable intraocular pressure during the same period@@ . the outflow pathway of the untreated eyes appeared morphologically normal@@ . in contrast , the dexamethasone @-@ treated hypertensive eyes had thickened trabecular beams , decreased inter@@ trabecular spaces , thickened jux@@ tac@@ anal@@ icular tissue , activated trabecular meshwork cells , and increased amounts of amorph@@ ogran@@ ular extracellular material , especially in the jux@@ tac@@ anal@@ icular tissue and beneath the endothelial lining of the canal of sch@@ lem@@ m. the dexamethasone @-@ treated non@@ responder eyes appeared to be morphologically similar to the untreated eyes , although several subtle dexamethasone @-@ induced morphologic changes were evid@@ ent@@ . conclusion : dexamethasone treatment of isolated , perfusion @-@ cultured human eyes led to the generation of ocular hypertension in approximately 30 % of the dexamethasone @-@ treated ey@@ es@@ . steroid treatment resulted in morphologic changes in the trabecular meshwork similar to those reported for corticosteroid glaucoma and open angle glauc@@ om@@ a. this system may provide an acute model in which to study the pathogenic mechanisms involved in steroid glaucoma and primary open angle glaucoma .

long @-@ term lithium treatment and the kidne@@ y@@ . interim report on fifty patient@@ s. this is a report on the first part of our study of the effects of long @-@ term lithium treatment on the kidne@@ y@@ . creatinine clearance , maximum urinary osmolality and 24 hour urine volume have been tested in 50 aff@@ ec@@ tively ill patients who have been on long @-@ term lithium for more than one year@@ . these findings have been compared with norms and with values of the same tests from screening prior to lithium , available for most of our patient@@ s. no evidence was found for any reduction of glomerular filtration during lithium treat@@ ment@@ . low clearance values found in several patients could be accounted for by their age and their pre @-@ lithium valu@@ es@@ . urinary concentration defect appeared frequent but the extent of the impairment is difficult to assess because of the uncertainty about the norms applicable to this group of patient@@ s. the concentration defect appeared reversible , at least in part@@ . poly@@ uria above 3 lit@@ res / 24 hours was found in 10 % of patient@@ s. an attempt is made to draw practical conclusions from the preliminary findings .

the epidemiology of the acute flank pain syndrome from su@@ prof@@ en@@ . su@@ profen , a new nonsteroidal anti @-@ inflammatory drug , was marketed in early 1986 as an analgesic ag@@ ent@@ . until physicians began reporting an unusual acute flank pain syndrome to the spontaneous reporting system , 7@@ 00@@ ,000 persons used the drug in the un@@ ited stat@@ es@@ . through aug@@ ust 1986 , a total of 163 cases of this syndrome were repor@@ te@@ d. to elucidate the epidemiology of the syndrome , a case @-@ control study was performed , comparing 62 of the case patients who had been reported to the spontaneous reporting system to 185 su@@ profen @-@ exposed control subjects who did not have the syn@@ dro@@ me@@ . case patients were more likely to be men ( odds ratio , 3.8 ; 95 % confidence interval , 1.2 @-@ 12.1 ) , suffer from hay fever and asthma ( odds ratio , 3.4 ; 95 % confidence interval , 1.0 @-@ 11.9 ) ; to participate in regular exercise ( odds ratio , 5.9 ; 95 % confidence interval , 1.1 @-@ 30.7 ) , especially in the use of n@@ au@@ til@@ us equipment ( p = 0.02 ) ; and to use alcohol ( odds ratio , 4.4 ; 95 % confidence interval , 1.1 @-@ 17.5 ) . possible risk factors included young age , concurrent use of other analgesic agents ( especially ibuprofen ) , preexisting renal disease , a history of kidney stones , a history of gout , a recent increase in activity , a recent increase in sun exposure , and residence in the sun@@ bel@@ t. these were findings that were suggestive but did not reach conventional statistical signific@@ anc@@ e. these findings are consistent with the postulated mechanism for this unusual syndrome : acute diffuse crystallization of uric acid in renal tubules .
hemolytic @-@ uremic syndrome associated with ingestion of quin@@ ine@@ . hemolytic @-@ uremic syndrome following quinine ingestion is a newly described phenomenon , with just two previous descriptions of 4 cases in the liter@@ at@@ ure@@ . we describe a 5th cas@@ e. the reaction may be mediated by the presence of antibodies reactive against platelets in the presence of quin@@ ine@@ . treatment has included use of plasma exchange , prednisone , aspirin , and dipyrid@@ am@@ ol@@ e. the patients have all regained some degree of renal function@@ . however , it is unclear whether pharmacological treatment or spontaneous resolution is responsible for the impro@@ v@@ ement@@ . quinine @-@ associated hemolytic @-@ uremic syndrome probably occurs more often than is recogn@@ iz@@ ed@@ . it is important to recognize this reaction when it occurs and to avoid further quinine exposure , since the reaction seems to be recurrent .
pyel@@ ou@@ reteral filling defects associated with systemic anticoagulation : a case repor@@ t. the etiology of pyel@@ oure@@ ter@@ itis cys@@ tica has long been attributed to chronic infection and inflam@@ m@@ ation@@ . a case is presented that is unique in that the acute onset and the rapid resolution of pyel@@ ou@@ reteral filling defects in this patient were documented by radi@@ og@@ rap@@ hy@@ . there is no evidence of antecedent or concurrent infection in this patient@@ . the disease occurred subsequent to the initiation of heparin therapy for suspected pelvic thromb@@ oph@@ le@@ bitis and cleared rapidly subsequent to its discontinu@@ ation@@ . the rate of resolution of the radiographic findings may be helpful in distinguishing between true pyel@@ oure@@ ter@@ itis cys@@ tica and submucosal hemorrhage .
changes in peroxisomes in preneoplastic liver and hepatoma of mice induced by alpha @-@ benzene hex@@ ach@@ lor@@ ide@@ . peroxisomes in hepat@@ omas and hyperplastic preneoplastic liver lesions induced in mice by 500 ppm alpha @-@ benzene hex@@ ach@@ loride were examined histochemically and electron microscop@@ ic@@ all@@ y@@ . although most of the hepat@@ omas were well @-@ differentiated tumors and contained a considerable number of peroxisomes , the tumor cells did not respond to ethyl @-@ alpha @-@ p @-@ chloro@@ phenoxy@@ isobut@@ yrate with proliferation of peroxis@@ om@@ es@@ . at the 16@@ th week of carcinogen feeding , hyperplastic nodules appeared and advanced to further stag@@ es@@ . a majority of the nodules showed a considerable number of peroxisomes and the inductive proliferation of peroxis@@ om@@ es@@ . within the nodules , foci of proliferation of the cells that showed no inducibility of proliferation of peroxisomes appe@@ are@@ d. these cells proliferated further , replacing the most part of the nodules , and with this process hepat@@ omas appeared to have been for@@ med@@ . no abnormal matr@@ ical inclusions of peroxisomes were formed in the cells of hyperplastic nodules by ethyl @-@ alpha @-@ p @-@ chloro@@ phenoxy@@ isobut@@ yrate unlike in the case of rats .
quinidine hepati@@ tis@@ . long @-@ term administration of quinidine was associated with persistent elevation of serum concentrations of s@@ got , lactic acid dehydrogenase , and alkaline phosphat@@ as@@ e. liver biopsy showed active hepati@@ tis@@ . discontinu@@ ance of quinidine therapy led to normalization of liver function test@@ s. a challenge dose of quinidine caused clinical symptoms and abrupt elevation of s@@ got , alkaline phosphatase , and lactic acid dehydrogenase valu@@ es@@ . we concluded that this patient had quinidine hepatotoxicity and believe that this is the first case reported with liver biopsy docum@@ ent@@ ation@@ . this report also suggests that , even after long @-@ term administration , the hepatic toxicity is reversible .
cholesteryl hemis@@ uccin@@ ate treatment protects rodents from the toxic effects of acetaminophen , adriamycin , carbon tetrachloride , chloroform and galactos@@ amin@@ e. in addition to its use as a stabilizer / rig@@ idi@@ fier of membranes , cholesteryl hemis@@ uccin@@ ate , tris salt ( cs ) administration has also been shown to protect rats from the hepat@@ otoxic effects of carbon tetrachloride ( c@@ cl@@ 4 ) . to further our understanding of the mechanism of cs cyto@@ protection , we examined in rats and mice the protective abilities of cs and the non @-@ hydroly@@ zable ether form of cs , gamma @-@ cholester@@ yloxy@@ butyric acid , tris salt ( c@@ se ) against acet@@ aminophen@@ - , ad@@ ri@@ amy@@ cin@@ - , carbon tetrach@@ lor@@ ide@@ - , chloro@@ form@@ - and galactosamine @-@ induced toxic@@ it@@ y@@ . the results of these studies demonstrated that cs @-@ mediated protection is not selective for a particular species , organ system or toxic chem@@ ic@@ al@@ . a 24 @-@ h pretreatment of both rats and mice with a single dose of cs ( 100@@ mg / kg , i.p. ) , resulted in significant protection against the hepat@@ otoxic effects of c@@ cl@@ 4 , ch@@ cl@@ 3 , acetaminophen and galactosamine and against the lethal ( and presumably cardi@@ otoxic ) effect of adriamycin administr@@ ation@@ . maximal cs @-@ mediated protection was observed in experimental animals pretreated 24 h prior to the toxic insul@@ t. these data suggest that cs interven@@ es in a critical cellular event that is an important common pathway to toxic cell de@@ ath@@ . the mechanism of cs protection does not appear to be dependent on the inhibition of chemical bio@@ activation to a toxic reactive intermediate ( in light of the protection observed against galactosamine hepatotoxicity ) . however , based on the data presented , we can not exclude the possibility that cs administration inhibits chemical bio@@ activ@@ ation@@ . our findings do suggest that cs @-@ mediated protection is dependent on the action of the intact anionic cs molecule ( non @-@ hydroly@@ zable c@@ se was as protective as cs ) , whose mechanism has yet to be defined .

results of a comparative , phase iii , 12 @-@ week , multicenter , prospective , randomized , double @-@ blind assessment of the efficacy and tolerability of a fixed @-@ dose combination of tel@@ mis@@ artan and amlodipine versus amlodipine monotherapy in in@@ dian adults with stage ii hyper@@ ten@@ sion@@ . objective : the aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of a new fixed @-@ dose combination ( f@@ dc ) of tel@@ mis@@ artan 40 mg + amlodipine 5 mg ( t + a ) compared with amlodipine 5 @-@ mg monotherapy ( a ) in adult in@@ dian patients with stage ii hyper@@ ten@@ sion@@ . methods : this comparative , phase iii , 12 @-@ week , multicenter , prospective , randomized , double @-@ blind study was conducted in in@@ dian patients aged 18 to 65 years with established stage ii hyper@@ ten@@ sion@@ . patients were treated with oral f@@ dc of t + a or a q@@ d before breakfast for 12 weeks ; blood pressure ( bp ) and heart rate were measured in the sitting posi@@ tion@@ . primary efficacy end points were reduction in clinical systolic bp ( s@@ bp ) / diastolic bp ( d@@ bp ) from baseline to study end and number of responders ( ie , patients who achieved target s@@ bp / d@@ bp &lt; 130 / &lt; 80 mm h@@ g ) at end of stud@@ y@@ . tolerability was assessed by treatment @-@ emergent adverse events , identified using physical examination , laboratory analysis , and electrocardi@@ og@@ rap@@ hy@@ . results : a total of 210 patients were enrolled in the study ; 203 patients ( 143 men , 60 women ) completed the study while 7 were lost to follow @-@ up ( 4 patients in the t + a group and 3 in the a group ) and considered with @-@ draw@@ n@@ . at study end , statistically significant percentage reductions from baseline within groups and between groups were observed in s@@ bp ( t + a &#91; -2@@ 7.4 % &#93; ; a &#91; -@@ 16.6 % &#93; ) and d@@ bp ( t + a &#91; -2@@ 0.1 % &#93; ; a &#91; -@@ 13.3 % &#93; ) ( all , p &lt; 0.05 ) . response rates were 8@@ 7.3 % ( 89 / 102 ) in the t + a group and 6@@ 9.3 % ( 70 / 101 ) in the a group ( p &lt; 0.05 ) . the prevalences of adverse events were not significantly different between the 2 treatment groups ( t + a , 16.0 % &#91; 17 / 106 &#93; ; a , 15.4 % &#91; 16 / 104 &#93; ) . peripheral edema was reported in 8.5 % patients ( 9 / 106 ) in the t + a group compared with 13.5 % ( 14 / 104 ) in the a group , and cough was reported in 3.8 % patients ( 4 / 106 ) in the t + a group and 1.0 % ( 1 / 104 ) patients in the a group ; these differences did not reach statistical signific@@ anc@@ e. the incidences of headache , dizziness , and diarrhea were similar between the 2 grou@@ ps@@ . conclusions : among these in@@ dian patients with stage ii hypertension , the f@@ dc of t + a was found to be significantly more effective , with regard to bp reductions , than a , and both treatments were well tolerated .
cutaneous leuc@@ ocyt@@ oc@@ lastic vasculitis associated with ox@@ ac@@ il@@ lin@@ . a 67 @-@ year @-@ old man who was treated with oxacillin for one week because of staphyloc@@ occus aureus bacteremia , developed renal failure and diffuse , symmetric , palpable purpur@@ ic lesions on his fe@@ et@@ . necrotic bli@@ sters were noted on his finger@@ s. skin biopsies showed findings diagnostic of leuc@@ ocyt@@ oc@@ lastic vascul@@ iti@@ s. oxacillin was discontinued and patient was treated with cortico@@ steroid@@ s. the rash disappeared after three weeks and renal function returned to normal@@ . leuc@@ ocyt@@ oc@@ lastic vasculitis presents as palpable purpura of the lower extremities often accompanied by abdominal pain , arthralgia , and renal invol@@ v@@ ement@@ . etiologic factors or associated disorders include infections , medications , collagen vascular disease and neo@@ plasi@@ a. however , in half of the cases no etiologic factor is identi@@ fi@@ ed@@ . usually it is a self @-@ limited disorder , but corticosteroid therapy may be needed in life @-@ threatening cases since early treatment with corticosteroids in severe cases can prevent complic@@ ation@@ s. oxacillin should be included among the drugs that can cause leuc@@ ocyt@@ oc@@ lastic vasculitis .
nal@@ ox@@ azone pretreatment modifies cardiorespiratory , temperature , and behavioral effects of morph@@ ine@@ . behavioral and cardiorespiratory responses to a lethal dose of morphine were evaluated in rats pretreated with saline or nal@@ ox@@ azone , an antagonist of high @-@ affinity mu 1 opioid recep@@ tor@@ s. pretreatment with nal@@ ox@@ azone significantly blocked morphine analgesia , catal@@ epsy and hypothermia at a dose which completely eliminated high @-@ affinity binding in brain membran@@ es@@ . moreover , nal@@ ox@@ azone significantly attenuated the morphine @-@ induced hypotension and respiratory depression , whereas morphine @-@ induced bradycardia was less aff@@ ec@@ te@@ d. results indicate that subpopulations of mu receptors may mediate selective behavioral and cardiorespiratory responses to morphine .
dex@@ raz@@ oxane protects against myelosuppression from the d@@ na cleavage @-@ enhancing drugs etoposide and daunorubicin but not dox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in@@ . purpose : the anthracyclines daunorubicin and doxorubicin and the epi@@ pod@@ ophyll@@ otoxin etoposide are potent d@@ na cleavage @-@ enhancing drugs that are widely used in clinical oncology ; however , myelosuppression and cardiac toxicity limit their use@@ . dex@@ raz@@ oxane ( ic@@ r@@ f @-@ 187 ) is recommended for protection against anthracycline @-@ induced cardi@@ otoxic@@ it@@ y@@ . experimental design : because of their widespread use , the hematologic toxicity following coadministration of dex@@ raz@@ oxane and these three structurally different d@@ na cleavage enhancers was investigated : sensitivity of human and murine blood progenitor cells to etoposide , daunorubicin , and doxorubicin + / - dex@@ raz@@ oxane was determined in granulocyte @-@ macrophage colony forming ass@@ ay@@ s. likewise , in vivo , b@@ 6@@ d@@ 2@@ f1 mice were treated with etoposide , daunorubicin , and doxorubicin , with or without dex@@ raz@@ oxane over a wide range of doses : posttreatment , a full hematologic evaluation was don@@ e. results : nontoxic doses of dex@@ raz@@ oxane reduced myelosuppression and weight loss from daunorubicin and etoposide in mice and antagonized their antiproliferative effects in the colony assay ; however , dex@@ raz@@ oxane neither reduced myelosuppression , weight loss , nor the in vitro cytotoxicity from dox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in@@ . conclusion : although our findings support the observation that dex@@ raz@@ oxane reduces neither hematologic activity nor antitumor activity from doxorubicin clinically , the potent antagonism of daunorubicin activity raises concern ; a possible interference with anticancer efficacy certainly would call for renewed att@@ enti@@ on@@ . our data also suggest that significant etoposide dose escalation is perhaps possible by the use of dex@@ raz@@ ox@@ ane@@ . clinical trials in patients with brain metastases combining dex@@ raz@@ oxane and high doses of etoposide is ongoing with the aim of improving efficacy without aggrav@@ ating hematologic toxic@@ it@@ y@@ . if successful , this represents an exciting mechanism for pharmacologic regulation of side effects from cytotoxic chemotherapy .

apomorphine : an under@@ utilized therapy for parkin@@ son &apos;s dise@@ as@@ e. apomorphine was the first dopaminergic drug ever used to treat symptoms of parkin@@ son &apos;s dise@@ as@@ e. while powerful anti@@ parkinsonian effects had been observed as early as 19@@ 51 , the potential of treating fluctuating parkin@@ son &apos;s disease by subcutaneous administration of apomorphine has only recently become the subject of systematic stud@@ y@@ . a number of small scale clinical trials have unequivocally shown that intermittent subcutaneous apomorphine injections produce anti@@ parkinsonian benefit close if not identical to that seen with levodopa and that apomorphine rescue injections can reliably rever@@ t off @-@ periods even in patients with complex on @-@ off motor sw@@ ing@@ s. continuous subcutaneous apomorphine infusions can reduce daily off @-@ time by more than 50 % in this group of patients , which appears to be a stronger effect than that generally seen with add @-@ on therapy with oral dopamine agonists or com@@ t inhibit@@ or@@ s. extended follow @-@ up studies of up to 8 years have demonstrated long @-@ term persistence of apomorphine efficac@@ y@@ . in addition , there is convincing clinical evidence that monotherapy with continuous subcutaneous apomorphine infusions is associated with marked reductions of preexisting levodopa @-@ induced dys@@ kine@@ si@@ as@@ . the main side effects of subcutaneous apomorphine treatment are related to cutaneous tolerability problems , whereas sedation and psychiatric complications play a lesser ro@@ le@@ . given the marked degree of efficacy of subcutaneous apomorphine treatment in fluctuating parkin@@ son &apos;s disease , this approach seems to deserve more widespread clinical use .

nerve growth factor and prostaglandins in the urine of female patients with overactive bl@@ ad@@ der@@ . purpose : n@@ g@@ f and p@@ gs in the bladder can be affected by pathological changes in the bladder and these changes can be detected in ur@@ ine@@ . we investigated changes in urinary n@@ g@@ f and p@@ gs in women with o@@ ab@@ . materials and methods : the study groups included 65 women with o@@ ab and 20 without bladder symptoms who served as contro@@ l@@ s. evaluation included patient history , urinalysis , a voiding diary and urodynamic studi@@ es@@ . urine samples were collec@@ te@@ d. n@@ g@@ f , p@@ ge@@ 2 , p@@ g@@ f@@ 2alpha and p@@ gi@@ 2 were measured using enzyme @-@ linked immunosorbent assay and compared between the grou@@ ps@@ . in addition , correlations between urinary n@@ g@@ f and pg , and urodynamic parameters in patients with o@@ ab were examin@@ ed@@ . results : urinary n@@ g@@ f , p@@ ge@@ 2 and p@@ g@@ f@@ 2alpha were significantly increased in patients with o@@ ab compared with controls ( p &lt; 0.05 ) . however , urinary p@@ gi@@ 2 was not different between controls and patients with o@@ ab@@ . in patients with o@@ ab urinary p@@ ge@@ 2 positively correlated with volume at first desire to void and maximum cyst@@ ometric capacity ( p &lt; 0.05 ) . urinary n@@ g@@ f , p@@ g@@ f@@ 2alpha and p@@ gi@@ 2 did not correlate with urodynamic parameters in patients with o@@ ab@@ . conclusions : n@@ g@@ f and p@@ gs have important roles in the development of o@@ ab symptoms in female patient@@ s. urinary levels of these factors may be used as markers to evaluate o@@ ab symptoms .
acute low back pain during intravenous administration of amiodarone : a report of two cas@@ es@@ . amiodarone represents an effective antiarrhythmic drug for cardioversion of recent @-@ onset atrial fibrillation ( af ) and maintenance of sinus rhyth@@ m. we briefly describe two patients suffering from recent @-@ onset atrial fibrillation , who experienced an acute devastating low back pain a few minutes after initiation of intravenous amiodarone load@@ ing@@ . notably , this side effect has not been ever reported in the medical liter@@ at@@ ure@@ . clinicians should be aware of this reaction since prompt termination of parenteral administration leads to complete resolution .
postoperative myalgia after succin@@ ylcholine : no evidence for an inflammatory orig@@ in@@ . a common side effect associated with succin@@ ylcholine is postoperative my@@ al@@ gi@@ a. the pathogenesis of this myalgia is still unclear ; inflammation has been suggested but without convincing evid@@ enc@@ e. we designed the present study to investigate whether an inflammatory reaction contributes to this my@@ al@@ gi@@ a. the incidence and severity of succin@@ ylcholine @-@ associated myalgia was determined in 64 patients pretreated with saline or dexamethasone before succin@@ ylcholine ( n = 32 for each ) . incidence and severity of myalgia did not differ significantly between the two groups : 15 patients in the dexamethasone group complained of myalgia compared with 18 patients in the saline group , and severe myalgia was reported by five patients and three patients , respectively ( not significant ) . at 48 h after surgery , 12 patients in both groups still suffered from myalgia ( not significant ) . in addition , interleukin @-@ 6 ( il @-@ 6 ) as an early marker of inflammation was assessed in a subgroup of 10 patients pretreated with sal@@ ine@@ . we found an increase of il @-@ 6 for only three patients , but only one patient reported myalgia ; no relationship between myalgia and the increase of il @-@ 6 was found@@ . in conclusion , there is no evidence for an inflammatory origin of succin@@ ylcholine @-@ associated my@@ al@@ gi@@ a. implications : administration of dexamethasone before succin@@ ylcholine was not effective in decreasing the incidence or the severity of succin@@ ylcholine @-@ induced postoperative my@@ al@@ gi@@ a. furthermore , there was no significant relationship between postoperative myalgia and time course of interleukin @-@ 6 concentrations , a marker of inflam@@ m@@ ation@@ . pretreatment with dexamethasone is not justified to prevent postoperative myalgia after succin@@ ylcholine .

protective effect of ed@@ ar@@ av@@ one against streptomycin @-@ induced vestibul@@ otoxicity in the guinea pig@@ . this study investigated alleviation of streptomycin @-@ induced vestibul@@ otoxicity by ed@@ ar@@ av@@ one in guinea pig@@ s. ed@@ ar@@ av@@ one , a free radical scavenger , has potent free radical quenching action and is used in clinical practice to treat cerebral infarc@@ tion@@ . streptomycin was administered to the inner ear by osmotic pump for 24 h , and ed@@ ar@@ av@@ one ( n = 8 ) or saline ( n = 6 ) was intraperitoneally injected once a day for 7 day@@ s. we observed horizontal vestibul@@ o @-@ ocular reflex as a marker of postoperative vestibular function@@ . animals injected with saline showed statistically smaller gains than those injected with ed@@ ar@@ av@@ on@@ e. these results suggest that ed@@ ar@@ av@@ one suppresses streptomycin @-@ induced vestibul@@ otoxicity .
ketamine in war / tropical surgery ( a final trib@@ ute to the racemic mixture ) . a technique of continuous intravenous anaesthesia with ketamine was used successfully during the som@@ alia civil war in 1994 and in north ug@@ anda in 1999 for 64 operations in 62 patients , aged from 6 weeks to 70 years , undergoing limb and abdominal surgery including ca@@ es@@ arian sections and interventions in neon@@ at@@ es@@ . operations lasting up to 2h could be performed in the absence of sophisticated equipment such as pulse ox@@ im@@ eters or venti@@ lators in patients on spontaneous ventilation breathing air / oxygen on@@ ly@@ . after premedication with diazepam , glyc@@ opyr@@ ro@@ late and local anaesthesia , and induction with standard doses of ketamine , a maintenance dose of 10 @-@ 20 microg / kg / min of ketamine proved safe and effec@@ ti@@ ve@@ . emphasis was placed on bedside clinical monitoring , relying heavily on the heart rat@@ e. diazepam , unless contraindicated or risky , remains the only necessary complementary drug to ketamine as it buffers its cardiovascular response and decreases the duration and intensity of operative and postoperative halluc@@ in@@ ation@@ s. local anaesthetic blocks were useful in decreasing the requirement for postoperative analge@@ si@@ a. an anti@@ sial@@ og@@ ue was usually unnecessary in operations lasting up to 2 h , glyc@@ opyr@@ ro@@ late being the best choice for its lowest psychotropic and chronotropic effects , especially in a hot clim@@ at@@ e. experience in war / tropical settings suggests this technique could be useful in civilian contexts such as outdoor life @-@ saving emergency surgery or in mass casu@@ alties where , e.g. amputation and rapid extr@@ ication were required .
steroid structure and pharmacological properties determine the anti @-@ amne@@ sic effects of pregnenolone sulphate in the passive avoidance task in rat@@ s. pregnenolone sulphate ( pre@@ gs ) has generated interest as one of the most potent memory @-@ enhancing neuro@@ steroids to be examined in rodent learning studies , with particular importance in the ageing process@@ . the mechanism by which this endogenous steroid enhances memory formation is hypothesized to involve actions on glutamatergic and gab@@ a@@ ergic system@@ s. this hypothesis stems from findings that pre@@ gs is a potent positive modulator of n @-@ methyl @-@ d @-@ aspartate receptors ( n@@ md@@ ars ) and a negative modulator of gamma @-@ aminobutyric acid ( a ) receptors ( gab@@ a ( a ) rs ) . moreover , pre@@ gs is able to reverse the amne@@ sic @-@ like effects of n@@ md@@ ar and gab@@ a ( a ) r lig@@ and@@ s. to investigate this hypothesis , the present study in rats examined the memory @-@ altering abilities of structural analogs of pre@@ gs , which differ in their modulation of n@@ md@@ ar and / or gab@@ a ( a ) r function@@ . the analogs tested were : 11 @-@ ket@@ opre@@ gn@@ enolone sulphate ( an agent that is inactive at gab@@ a ( a ) rs and n@@ md@@ ars ) , epi@@ pregn@@ an@@ olone ( &#91; 3beta @-@ hydroxy @-@ 5@@ beta @-@ pregn@@ an @-@ 20 @-@ one &#93; sulphate , an inhibitor of both gab@@ a ( a ) rs and n@@ md@@ ars ) , and a newly synthesized ( - ) pre@@ gs enantiomer ( which is identical to pre@@ gs in effects on gab@@ a ( a ) rs and n@@ md@@ ars ) . the memory @-@ enhancing effects of pre@@ gs and its analogs were tested in the passive avoidance task using the model of scopolamine @-@ induced amne@@ si@@ a. both pre@@ gs and its ( - ) enantiomer blocked the effects of scop@@ ol@@ amin@@ e. the results show that , unlike pre@@ gs , 11 @-@ ket@@ opre@@ gn@@ enolone sulphate and epi@@ pregn@@ an@@ olone sulphate failed to block the effect of scopolamine , suggesting that altering the modulation of nm@@ da receptors diminishes the memory @-@ enhancing effects of preg@@ s. moreover , enantioselectivity was demonstrated by the ability of natural pre@@ gs to be an order of magnitude more effective than its synthetic enantiomer in reversing scopolamine @-@ induced amne@@ si@@ a. these results identify a novel neuro@@ pharmacological site for the modulation of memory processes by neuro@@ active steroids .
preliminary efficacy assessment of intrathecal injection of an amer@@ ican formulation of adenosine in human@@ s. background : preclinical studies of intrathecal adenosine suggest it may be effective in the treatment of acute and chronic pain in humans , and preliminary studies in volunteers and patients with a swe@@ dish formulation of adenosine suggests it may be effective in hypersensitivity states but not with acute noxious stimul@@ ation@@ . the purpose of this study was to screen for efficacy of a different formulation of adenosine marketed in the us , using both acute noxious stimulation and capsaicin @-@ evoked mechanical hyper@@ sensi@@ tiv@@ it@@ y@@ . methods : following food and drug administration and institutional review board approval and written informed consent , 65 volunteers were studied in two trials : an open @-@ label , dose @-@ escalating trial with intrathecal adenosine doses of 0.25 @-@ 2.0 mg and a double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled trial of adenosine , 2 m@@ g. cerebrospinal fluid was obtained for pharmacokinetic analysis , and pain ratings in response to acute heat stimuli and areas of mechanical hyperalgesia and allodynia after intradermal capsaicin injection were determin@@ ed@@ . results : adenosine produced no effect on pain report to acute noxious thermal or chemical stimulation but reduced mechanical hyperalgesia and allodynia from intradermal capsaicin injection for at least 24 h@@ . in contrast , residence time of adenosine in cerebrospinal fluid was short ( &lt; 4 h ) . conclusions : these results show selective inhibition by intrathecal adenosine of hypersensitivity , presumed to reflect central sensitization in humans after peripheral capsaicin injec@@ tion@@ . the long @-@ lasting effect is consistent with that observed in preliminary reports of patients with chronic neuropathic pain and is not due to prolonged residence of adenosine in cerebrospinal fluid .
effect of lithium maintenance therapy on thyroid and parathyroid function@@ . objectives : to assess changes induced by lithium maintenance therapy on the incidence of thyroid , parathyroid and ion alter@@ ation@@ s. these were evaluated with respect to the duration of lithium therapy , age , sex , and family history ( whether or not the patient had a first @-@ degree relative with thyroid disease ) . design : prospective stud@@ y@@ . setting : affective disorders clinic at st@@ . mary &apos;s hospital , mon@@ tre@@ al@@ . patients : one hundred and one patients ( 28 men and 73 women ) with bipolar disorder receiving lithium maintenance therapy ranging from 1 year &apos;s to 32 years &apos; dur@@ ation@@ . the control group consisted of 82 patients with no psychiatric or endocrin@@ ological diagnoses from the hospital &apos;s out @-@ patient clinic@@ s. outcome measures : laboratory analyses of calcium , magnesium and thyroid @-@ stimulating hormone levels performed before beginning lithium therapy and at bi@@ annual follow @-@ up@@ . results : hypothyroidism developed in 40 patients , excluding 8 patients who were hypothyroid at bas@@ el@@ ine@@ . all patients having first @-@ degree relatives affected by thyroid illness had accelerated onset of hypothyroidism ( 3.7 years after onset of lithium therapy ) compared with patients without a family history ( 8.6 years after onset of lithium therapy ) . women over 60 years of age were more often affected by hypothyroidism than women under 60 years of age ( 34.6 % versus 31.9 % ) . magnesium levels in patients on lithium treatment were unchanged from baseline lev@@ el@@ s. after lithium treatment , calcium levels were higher than either baseline levels or control lev@@ el@@ s. thus , lithium treatment counteracted the decrease in plasma calcium levels associated with ag@@ ing@@ . conclusions : familial thyroid illness is a risk factor for hypothyroidism and hypercalcemia during lithium therapy .
systemic toxicity following administration of sirolimus ( formerly rapamycin ) for psoriasis : association of capillary leak syndrome with apoptosis of lesional lymph@@ ocyt@@ es@@ . background : sirolimus ( formerly rapamycin ) is an immunosuppressive agent that interferes with t @-@ cell activ@@ ation@@ . after 2 individuals with psoriasis developed a capillary leak syndrome following treatment with oral sirolimus lesional skin cells and activated peripheral blood cells were analyzed for induction of apopto@@ si@@ s. observations : a kerat@@ ome skin specimen from 1 patient with sirolimus @-@ induced capillary leak syndrome had a 2.3 @-@ fold increase in percentage of apoptotic cells ( to 48 % ) compared with an unaffected sirolimus @-@ treated patient with psoriasis ( 21 % ) . activated peripheral blood t cells from patients with psoriasis tended to exhibit greater spontaneous or dexamethasone @-@ induced apoptosis than did normal t cells , particularly in the presence of si@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ . conclusions : severe adverse effects of sirolimus include fever , anemia , and capillary leak syn@@ dro@@ me@@ . these symptoms may be the result of drug @-@ induced apoptosis of lesional leukocytes , especially activated t lymphocytes , and possibly release of inflammatory medi@@ ator@@ s. because patients with severe psoriasis may develop capillary leak from various systemic therapies , clinical monitoring is advisable for patients with inflammatory diseases who are treated with immune modulators .
contribution of the glycine site of nm@@ da receptors in rostral and intermediate @-@ caudal parts of the striatum to the regulation of muscle tone in rat@@ s. the aim of the present study was to assess the contribution of the glycine site of nm@@ da receptors in the striatum to the regulation of muscle ton@@ e. muscle tone was examined using a combined mechano@@ and electromyographic method , which measured simultaneously the muscle resistance ( m@@ mg ) of the rat &apos;s hind foot to passive extension and flexion in the ankle joint and the electromyographic activity ( em@@ g ) of the antagonistic muscles of that joint : gastrocnemius and tibialis anteri@@ or@@ . muscle rigidity was induced by haloperidol ( 2.5 mg / kg i.p. ) . 5,7 @-@ dichloro@@ kynu@@ renic acid ( 5,7 @-@ d@@ c@@ ka ) , a selective glycine site antagonist , injected in doses of 2.5 and 4.5 microg / 0.5 microl bilaterally , into the rostral region of the striatum , decreased both the haloperidol @-@ induced muscle rigidity ( m@@ mg ) and the enhanced electromyographic activity ( em@@ g ) . 5,7 @-@ d@@ c@@ ka injected bilaterally in a dose of 4.5 microg / 0.5 microl into the intermediate @-@ caudal region of the striatum of rats not pretreated with haloperidol had no effect on the muscle ton@@ e. the present results suggest that blockade of the glycine site of nm@@ da receptors in the rostral part of the striatum may be mainly responsible for the anti@@ parkinsonian action of this drug .

the ability of insulin treatment to reverse or prevent the changes in urinary bladder function caused by streptozotocin @-@ induced diabetes mellitus . 1@@ . the effects of insulin treatment on in vivo and in vitro urinary bladder function in streptozotocin @-@ diabetic rats were investigated . 2. diabetes of 2 months duration resulted in decreases in body weight and increases in fluid consumption , urine volume , frequency of micturition , and average volume per micturition ; effects which were prevented by insulin treatment . 3. insulin treatment also prevented the increases in contractile responses of bladder body strips from diabetic rats to nerve stimulation , at@@ p , and be@@ than@@ ech@@ ol . 4@@ . diabetes of 4 months duration also resulted in decreases in body weight , and increases in fluid consumption , urine volume , frequency of micturition , and average volume per micturition , effects which were reversed by insulin treatment for the final 2 months of the study . 5@@ . insulin treatment reversed the increases in contractile responses of bladder body strips from diabetic rats to nerve stimulation , at@@ p , and be@@ than@@ ech@@ ol . 6@@ . the data indicate that the effects of streptozotocin @-@ induced diabetes on urinary bladder function are both prevented and reversed by insulin treatment .
delayed institution of hypertension during focal cerebral ischemia : effect on brain ede@@ ma@@ . the effect of induced hypertension instituted after a 2 @-@ h delay following middle cerebral artery occlusion ( m@@ ca@@ o ) on brain edema formation and histochemical injury was studi@@ ed@@ . under isoflurane anesthesia , the m@@ ca of 14 spontaneously hypertensive rats was oc@@ clu@@ de@@ d. in the control group ( n = 7 ) , the mean arterial pressure ( map ) was not manip@@ ul@@ ated@@ . in the hypertensive group ( n = 7 ) , the map was elevated by 25 @-@ 30 mm h@@ g beginning 2 h after m@@ ca@@ o. four hours after m@@ ca@@ o , the rats were killed and the brains harve@@ ste@@ d. the brains were sectioned along coronal planes spanning the distribution of ischemia produced by m@@ ca@@ o. specific gravity ( s@@ g ) was determined in the sub@@ cortex and in two sites in the cortex ( core and periphery of the ischemic territory ) . the extent of neuronal injury was determined by 2,@@ 3,5 @-@ triphenyl@@ tetrazolium stain@@ ing@@ . in the ischemic core , there was no difference in s@@ g in the sub@@ cortex and cortex in the two grou@@ ps@@ . in the periphery of the ischemic territory , s@@ g in the cortex was greater ( less edema accumulation ) in the hypertensive group ( 1.0@@ 41 + / - 0.001 vs 1.0@@ 39 + / - 0.001 , p less than 0.05 ) . the area of histochemical injury ( as a percent of the cross @-@ sectional area of the hemisphere ) was less in the hypertensive group ( 33 + / - 3 % vs 21 + / - 2 % , p less than 0.05 ) . the data indicate that phenylephrine @-@ induced hypertension instituted 2 h after m@@ ca@@ o does not aggravate edema in the ischemic core , that it improves edema in the periphery of the ischemic territory , and that it reduces the area of histochemical neuronal dysfunction .
amiodarone pulmonary toxic@@ it@@ y@@ . amiodarone is an effective antiarrhythmic agent whose utility is limited by many side @-@ effects , the most problematic being pneumon@@ iti@@ s. the pulmonary toxicity of amiodarone is thought to result from direct injury related to the intracellular accumulation of phospholipid and t cell @-@ mediated hypersensitivity pneumon@@ iti@@ s. the clinical and radiographic features of amiodarone @-@ induced pulmonary toxicity are characteristic but non@@ specific@@ . the diagnosis depends on exclusion of other entities , such as heart failure , infection , and malign@@ anc@@ y@@ . while withdrawal of amiodarone leads to clinical improvement in majority of cases , this is not always possible or advis@@ ab@@ le@@ . dose reduction or concomitant steroid therapy may have a role in selected patients .
light chain proteinuria and cellular mediated immunity in rifampin treated patients with tubercul@@ osi@@ s. light chain proteinuria was found in 9 of 17 tuberculosis patients treated with rifamp@@ in@@ . concomitant assay of cellular mediated immunity in these patients using skin test antigen and a lymphokine in vitro test provided results that were differen@@ t. response to var@@ idase skin test antigen was negative for all eight tuberculosis patients tested , but there occurred a hyper @-@ responsiveness of the lymphocytes of these eight patients to phyt@@ om@@ it@@ ogen ( ph@@ a @-@ p ) . as well as of those of seven other tuberculous patient@@ s. this last finding may be related to time of testing and / or endogenous serum binding of rifampin which could have inhibited mitogen activity for the lymphocyte .
initial potassium loss and hypo@@ kal@@ aemia during chlor@@ thal@@ idone administration in patients with essential hypertension : the influence of dietary sodium restric@@ tion@@ . to investigate the initial potassium loss and development of hypo@@ kal@@ aemia during the administration of an oral diuretic , metabolic balance studies were performed in ten patients with essential hypertension who had shown hypo@@ kal@@ aemia under prior oral diuretic treat@@ ment@@ . chlor@@ thal@@ idone ( 50 mg daily ) was given for 14 day@@ s. six patients received a normal @-@ sodium diet and four a low @-@ sodium ( 17 mmol / day ) diet@@ . all patients had a normal initial total body potassium ( 40@@ k ) . the electrolyte balances , weight , bromide space , plasma renin activity , and aldosterone secretion rate were measure@@ d. in both groups a potassium deficit developed , with proportionally larger losses from the extracellular than from the intracellular compartment@@ . in the normal @-@ sodium group the highest mean potassium deficit was 176 mmol on day 9 , after which some potassium was regained ; in the low @-@ sodium group the highest deficit was 276 mmol on day 13@@ . the normal @-@ sodium group showed an immediate but temporary rise of the renin and aldosterone levels ; in the low @-@ sodium group renin and aldosterone increased more slowly but remained elev@@ ated@@ . it is concluded that dietary sodium restriction increases diuretic @-@ induced potassium loss , presumably by an increased activity of the renin @-@ angiotensin @-@ aldosterone system , while sodium delivery to the distal renal tubules remains sufficiently high to allow increased potassium secretion .
dynamic response of blood vessel in acute renal fail@@ ure@@ . in this study we postulated that during acute renal failure induced by gentamicin the transient or dynamic response of blood vessels could be affected , and that antioxidants can prevent the changes in dynamic responses of blood v@@ ess@@ el@@ s. the new approach to ex vivo blood vessel experiments in which not only the end points of vessels response within the time interval is considered , but also dynamics of this response , was used in this pap@@ er@@ . our results confirm the alteration in dynamic response of blood vessels during the change of pressure in gentamicin @-@ treated anim@@ al@@ s. the beneficial effects of vitamin c administration to gentamicin @-@ treated animals are also confirmed through : lower level of blood urea and creatinine and higher level of pot@@ assi@@ um@@ . the pressure dynamic responses of isolated blood vessels show a faster pressure change in gentamicin @-@ treated animals ( 8.@@ 07 + / - 1.7 s vs. 5.@@ 64 + / - 0.18 s ) . vitamin c administration induced slow@@ down of pressure change back to the control valu@@ es@@ . the pressure dynamic properties , quantitatively defined by comparative pressure dynamic and total pressure dynamic , confirm the alteration in dynamic response of blood vessels during the change of pressure in gentamicin @-@ treated animals and beneficial effects of vitamin c administration .
the hemodynamics of oxytocin and other vasoactive agents during neur@@ axial anesthesia for cesarean delivery : findings in six cas@@ es@@ . oxytocin is a commonly used uter@@ otonic that can cause significant and even fatal hypotension , particularly when given as a bol@@ us@@ . the resulting hypotension can be produced by a decrease in systemic vascular resistance or cardiac output through a decrease in venous retur@@ n@@ . partur@@ ients with normal volume status , heart valves and pulmonary vasculature most often respond to this hypotension with a compensatory increase in heart rate and stroke volu@@ me@@ . oxytocin @-@ induced hypotension at cesarean delivery may be incorrectly attributed to blood los@@ s. pulse power analysis ( also called &quot; pulse contour analysis &quot; ) of an arterial pressure wave form allows continuous evaluation of systemic vascular resistance and cardiac output in real time , thereby elucidating the causative factors behind changes in blood pres@@ su@@ re@@ . pulse power analysis was conducted in six cases of cesarean delivery performed under neur@@ axial anesthesi@@ a. hypotension in response to oxytocin was associated with a decrease in systemic vascular resistance and a compensatory increase in stroke volume , heart rate and cardiac out@@ put@@ . pulse power analysis may be helpful in determining the etiology of and treating hypotension during cesarean delivery under neur@@ axial anesthesia .
exaggerated expression of inflammatory mediators in vasoactive intestinal polypeptide knockout ( vi@@ p- / - ) mice with cyclophosphamide ( cy@@ p ) -induced cy@@ sti@@ tis@@ . vasoactive intestinal polypeptide ( vi@@ p ) is an immunomodulatory neuropeptide distributed in micturition path@@ w@@ ay@@ s. vi@@ p ( - / - ) mice exhibit altered bladder function and neurochemical properties in micturition pathways after cyclophosphamide ( cy@@ p ) -induced cy@@ sti@@ tis@@ . given vi@@ p &apos;s role as an anti @-@ inflammatory mediator , we hypothesized that vi@@ p ( - / - ) mice would exhibit enhanced inflammatory mediator expression after cy@@ sti@@ tis@@ . a mouse inflammatory cytokine and receptor r@@ t2 profil@@ er array was used to determine regulated transcripts in the urinary bladder of wild type ( wt ) and vi@@ p ( - / - ) mice with or without cy@@ p @-@ induced cystitis ( 150 mg / kg ; i.p. ; 48 h ) . four binary comparisons were made : wt control versus cy@@ p treatment ( 48 h ) , vi@@ p ( - / - ) control versus cy@@ p treatment ( 48 h ) , wt control versus vi@@ p ( - / - ) control , and wt with cy@@ p treatment ( 48 h ) versus vi@@ p ( - / - ) with cy@@ p treatment ( 48 h ) . the genes presented represent ( 1 ) greater than 1.5 @-@ fold change in either direction and ( 2 ) the p value is less than 0.05 for the comparison being ma@@ de@@ . several regulated genes were validated using enzyme @-@ linked immunoassays including il @-@ 1beta and c@@ x@@ cl@@ 1@@ . cy@@ p treatment significantly ( p &lt; or = 0.001 ) increased expression of c@@ x@@ cl@@ 1 and il @-@ 1beta in the urinary bladder of wt and vi@@ p ( - / - ) mice , but expression in vi@@ p ( - / - ) mice with cy@@ p treatment was significantly ( p &lt; or = 0.001 ) greater ( 4.@@ 2- to 13 @-@ fold increase ) than that observed in wt urinary bladder ( 3.@@ 6- to 5 @-@ fold increase ) . the data suggest that in vi@@ p ( - / - ) mice with bladder inflammation , inflammatory mediators are increased above that observed in wt with cyp@@ . this shift in balance may contribute to increased bladder dysfunction in vi@@ p ( - / - ) mice with bladder inflammation and altered neurochemical expression in micturition pathways .

case report : dex@@ atri@@ m ( phenyl@@ propan@@ olamine ) as a cause of myocardial infarc@@ tion@@ . phenyl@@ propan@@ olamine ( pp@@ a ) is a sympathetic amine used in over @-@ the @-@ counter cold remedies and weight @-@ control preparations worl@@ d@@ wide@@ . its use has been associated with hypertensive episodes and hemorrhagic strokes in younger wom@@ en@@ . several reports have linked the abuse of pp@@ a with myocardial injury , especially when overdose is invol@@ ve@@ d. we report here the first case of dex@@ atri@@ m ( pp@@ a ) -induced myocardial injury in a young woman who was using it at recommended doses for weight contro@@ l@@ . in addition , we review the 7 other cases of pp@@ a related myocardial injury that have been reported so far@@ . physicians and patients should be alert to the potential cardiac risk associated with the use of pp@@ a , even at doses generally considered to be safe .
risperidone @-@ associated , benign transient visual disturbances in schizophrenic patients with a past history of l@@ sd ab@@ use@@ . two schizophrenic patients , who had a prior history of l@@ sd abuse and who had previously developed eps with classic antipsychotics , were successfully treated with ris@@ perid@@ on@@ e. they both reported short episodes of transient visual disturbances , which appeared immediately after starting treatment with ris@@ perid@@ on@@ e. this imagery resembled visual disturbances previously experienced as &quot; fl@@ ash@@ backs &quot; related to prior l@@ sd con@@ sump@@ tion@@ . risperidone administration was continued and the visual disturbances gradually wore off@@ . during a six @-@ month follow @-@ up period , there was no recurrence of visual disturb@@ anc@@ es@@ . this phenomenon may be interpreted as a benign , short @-@ term and self @-@ limiting side effect which does not contrain@@ dic@@ ate the use of risperidone or interfere with treat@@ ment@@ . conclusions based on two case reports should be taken with appropriate caution .
activation of poly ( ad@@ p @-@ ribose ) polymerase contributes to development of doxorubicin @-@ induced heart fail@@ ure@@ . activation of the nuclear enzyme poly ( ad@@ p @-@ ribose ) polymerase ( par@@ p ) by oxidant @-@ mediated d@@ na damage is an important pathway of cell dysfunction and tissue injury in conditions associated with oxidative stress@@ . increased oxidative stress is a major factor implicated in the cardiotoxicity of doxorubicin ( dox ) , a widely used antitumor anthracycline antibio@@ tic@@ . thus , we hypothesized that the activation of par@@ p may contribute to the dox @-@ induced cardi@@ otoxic@@ it@@ y@@ . using a dual approach of par@@ p @-@ 1 suppression , by genetic deletion or pharmacological inhibition with the phen@@ anth@@ rid@@ inone par@@ p inhibitor p@@ j@@ 34 , we now demonstrate the role of par@@ p in the development of cardiac dysfunction induced by dox@@ . par@@ p @-@ 1 + / + and par@@ p @-@ 1- / - mice received a single injection of dox ( 25 mg / kg i.@@ p ) . five days after dox administration , left ventricular performance was significantly depressed in par@@ p @-@ 1 + / + mice , but only to a smaller extent in par@@ p @-@ 1- / - on@@ es@@ . similar experiments were conducted in bal@@ b / c mice treated with p@@ j@@ 34 or veh@@ ic@@ le@@ . treatment with a p@@ j@@ 34 significantly improved cardiac dysfunction and increased the survival of the anim@@ al@@ s. in addition p@@ j@@ 34 significantly reduced the dox @-@ induced increase in the serum lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase activities but not metalloproteinase activation in the heart@@ . thus , par@@ p activation contributes to the cardiotoxicity of dox@@ . par@@ p inhibitors may exert protective effects against the development of severe cardiac complications associated with the dox treatment .

neutrophil superoxide and hydrogen peroxide production in patients with acute liver fail@@ ure@@ . defects in superoxide and hydrogen peroxide production may be implicated in the high incidence of bacterial infections in patients with acute liver failure ( al@@ f ) . in the present study , oxygen radical production in patients with al@@ f due to paracetamol overdose was compared with that of healthy volunte@@ er@@ s. neutrophils from 14 al@@ f patients were stimulated via the complement receptors using zymosan opsonized with al@@ f or control ser@@ um@@ . superoxide and hydrogen peroxide production by al@@ f neutrophils stimulated with zymosan opsonized with al@@ f serum was significantly reduced compared with the control subjects ( p &lt; 0.01 ) . this defect persisted when zymosan opsonized by control serum was used ( p &lt; 0.05 ) . superoxide and hydrogen peroxide production in neutrophils stimulated with formyl @-@ methionyl @-@ leucyl @-@ phenylalanine ( f@@ m@@ l@@ p ) from a further 18 al@@ f patients was unaffected compared with control neutroph@@ il@@ s. serum c@@ 3 complement levels were significantly reduced in al@@ f patients compared with control subjects ( p &lt; 0.0005 ) . these results demonstrate a neutrophil defect in al@@ f due to paracetamol overdose , that is complement dependent but independent of serum complement , possibly connected to the complement receptor .
absence of effect of sertraline on time @-@ based sensitization of cognitive impairment with hal@@ oper@@ id@@ ol@@ . this double @-@ blind , randomized , placebo @-@ controlled study evaluated the effects of haloperidol alone and haloperidol plus sertraline on cognitive and psychomotor function in 24 healthy male subjec@@ ts@@ . method : all subjects received placebo on day 1 and haloperidol 2 mg on days 2 and 25@@ . from days 9 to 25 , subjects were randomly assigned to either sertraline ( 12 subjects ) or placebo ( 12 subjects ) ; the sertraline dose was titrated from 50 to 200 mg / day from days 9 to 16 , and remained at 200 mg / day for the final 10 days of the drug administration period@@ . cognitive function testing was performed before dosing and over a 24 @-@ hour period after dosing on days 1 , 2 , and 25@@ . results : impairment of cognitive function was observed 6 to 8 hours after administration of haloperidol on day 2 but was not evident 23 hours after dos@@ ing@@ . when single @-@ dose haloperidol was given again 25 days later , greater impairment with earlier onset was noted in several tests in both treatment groups , suggesting enhancement of this effec@@ t. there was no indication that sertraline exacerbated the impairment produced by haloperidol since an equivalent effect also occurred in the placebo grou@@ p. three subjects ( 2 on sertraline and 1 on placebo ) with@@ drew from the study because of side effec@@ ts@@ . ten subjects in each group reported side effects related to treat@@ ment@@ . the side effect profiles of sertraline and of placebo were simil@@ ar@@ . conclusion : haloperidol produced a clear profile of cognitive impairment that was not worsened by concomitant sertraline administration .
ciprofloxacin @-@ induced nephrotoxicity in patients with cancer@@ . nephrotoxicity associated with ciprofloxacin is un@@ common@@ . five patients with cancer who developed acute renal failure that followed treatment with ciprofloxacin are described and an additional 15 cases reported in the literature are revie@@ wed@@ . other than elevation of serum creatinine levels , characteristic clinical manifestations and abnormal laboratory findings are not frequently present@@ . allergic interstitial nephritis is believed to be the underlying pathological @-@ process@@ . definitive diagnosis requires performance of renal biopsy , although this is not always fe@@ asi@@ ble@@ . an improvement in renal function that followed the discontinuation of the offending antibiotic supports the presumptive diagnosis of ciprofloxacin @-@ induced acute renal failure .
case report : pent@@ amidine and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia re@@ vis@@ it@@ ed@@ . pent@@ amidine is@@ eth@@ ion@@ ate has been associated with ventricular tachyarrhythmias , including tor@@ s@@ ade de po@@ intes@@ . this article reports two cases of this complication and reviews all reported cases to dat@@ e. pent@@ amidine @-@ induced tor@@ s@@ ade de point@@ es may be related to serum magnesium levels and hypom@@ agnes@@ emia may synergistically induce tor@@ s@@ ade@@ . tor@@ s@@ ade de point@@ es occurred after an average of 10 days of treatment with pent@@ amid@@ ine@@ . in these patients , no other acute side effects of pent@@ amidine were obser@@ ve@@ d. tor@@ s@@ ade de point@@ es can be treated when recognized early , possibly without discontinuation of pent@@ amid@@ ine@@ . when q@@ t@@ c interval prolongation is observed , early magnesium supplementation is advocated .
time dependence of plasma malondialdehyde , ox@@ yp@@ urines , and nucleosides during incomplete cerebral ischemia in the rat@@ . incomplete cerebral ischemia ( 30 min ) was induced in the rat by bilaterally clamping the common carotid arteri@@ es@@ . peripheral venous blood samples were withdrawn from the femoral vein four times ( once every 5 min ) before ischemia ( 0 time ) and 5 , 15 , and 30 min after ischem@@ i@@ a. plasma extracts were analyzed by a highly sensitive high @-@ performance liquid chromatographic method for the direct determination of malondialdehyde , ox@@ yp@@ urines , and nucle@@ osi@@ des@@ . during ischemia , a time @-@ dependent increase of plasma ox@@ yp@@ urines and nucleosides was obser@@ ve@@ d. plasma malondialdehyde , which was present in minimal amount at zero time ( 0.0@@ 58 mumol / liter plasma ; sd 0.015 ) , increased after 5 min of ischemia , resulting in a fivefold increase after 30 min of carotid occlusion ( 0.2@@ 98 mumol / liter plasma ; sd 0.0@@ 78 ) . increased plasma malondialdehyde was also recorded in two other groups of animals subjected to the same experimental model , one receiving 20 mg / kg b.w. of the cyclooxygenase inhibitor acetyl@@ salicylate intravenously immediately before ischemia , the other receiving 650 micrograms / kg b.w. of the hypotensive drug nitroprusside at a flow rate of 103 microliters / min intravenously during ischemia , although in this latter group malondialdehyde was significantly high@@ er@@ . the present data indicate that the determination of malondialdehyde , ox@@ yp@@ urines , and nucleosides in peripheral blood , may be used to monitor the metabolic alterations of tissues occurring during ischemic phenomena .

cholinergic toxicity resulting from ocular instillation of ech@@ othi@@ oph@@ ate iodide eye dro@@ ps@@ . a patient developed a severe cholinergic syndrome from the use of ech@@ othi@@ oph@@ ate iodide ophthalmic drops , presented with profound muscle weakness and was initially given the diagnosis of myasthenia gra@@ vis@@ . red blood cell and serum cholinesterase levels were severely depressed and symptoms resolved spontaneously following discontinuation of the eye drops .
acute renal failure in high dose carboplatin chemo@@ therap@@ y@@ . carboplatin has been reported to cause acute renal failure when administered in high doses to adult patient@@ s. we report a 4 1 / 2 @-@ year @-@ old girl who was treated with high @-@ dose carboplatin for metastatic param@@ ening@@ eal embryonal rhabdomy@@ os@@ arcom@@ a. acute renal failure developed followed by a slow partial recovery of renal function@@ . possible contributing factors are discussed .
endometrial carcinoma after h@@ odg@@ kin disease in child@@ ho@@ od@@ . a 34 @-@ year @-@ old patient developed met@@ astic endometrial carcinoma after h@@ odg@@ kin disease in child@@ ho@@ od@@ . she had ovarian failure after abdominal irradiation and chemotherapy for h@@ odg@@ kin disease , and received exogenous estrogens , a treatment implicated in the development of endometrial cancer in menopausal wom@@ en@@ . young women on replacement estrogens for ovarian failure after cancer therapy may also have increased risk of endometrial carcinoma and should be examined periodically .
induction of the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome in a woman by exogenous androgen administr@@ ation@@ . we documented airway occlusion during sleep and an abnormally high suprag@@ lottic resistance while awake in a 54 @-@ yr @-@ old woman who had developed physical changes and the syndrome of obstructive sleep apnea while being administered exogenous androgen@@ s. when the androgens were withdrawn , the patient &apos;s physical changes , symptoms , sleep study , and suprag@@ lottic resistance all returned to normal@@ . a re@@ challenge with androgen produced symptoms of obstructive sleep apnea that ab@@ ated upon withdrawal of the hormon@@ e. previous reports have favored a role of androgens in the pathogenesis of sleep apne@@ a. our report provides direct evidence for this ro@@ le@@ . structural and functional measurements indicate that androgens exert a permissive or necessary action on the structural configuration of the oropharynx that predisposes to obstruction during sle@@ ep@@ . development of the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome must be considered a possible side effect of androgen therapy .
effect of captopril on pre @-@ existing and amin@@ onucle@@ oside @-@ induced proteinuria in spontaneously hypertensive rat@@ s. proteinuria is a side effect of captopril treatment in hypertensive patient@@ s. the possibility of reproducing the same renal abnormality with captopril was examined in sh@@ r@@ . oral administration of captopril at 100 mg / kg for 14 days failed to aggravate proteinuria pre @-@ existing in sh@@ r@@ . also , captopril treatment failed to potentiate or facilitate development of massive proteinuria inv@@ oked by puromycin amin@@ onucle@@ oside in sh@@ r@@ . captopril had little or no demonstrable effects on serum electrolyte concentrations , excretion of urine , sodium and potassium , endogenous creatinine clearance , body weight , and food and water con@@ sump@@ tion@@ . however , ketone bodies were consistently present in urine and several le@@ thal@@ ities occurred during multiple dosing of captopril in sh@@ r .
epileptogenic properties of enflurane and their clinical interpre@@ t@@ ation@@ . three cases of e@@ eg changes induced by single exposure to enflurane anesthesia are repor@@ te@@ d. in one patient , enflurane administered during a donor nephrectomy resulted in unexpected partial motor seiz@@ u@@ res@@ . until the cause of the seizures was correctly identified , the patient was inappropriately treated with anticonvuls@@ ant@@ s. two other patients suffered from partial , complex and generalized seizures uncontrolled by medic@@ ation@@ . epileptic foci delineated and activated by enflurane were surgically ablated and the patients are now seizure @-@ fre@@ e. previous exposures to enflurane have to be disclosed to avoid mist@@ akes in clinical interpretation of the e@@ eg@@ . on the other hand , enflurane may prove to be a safe fast acting activator of epileptic foci during cortic@@ ography or depth electrode intraoperative recordings .
reversible cerebral lesions associated with tiaz@@ ofur@@ in usage : m@@ r demonstr@@ ation@@ . tiaz@@ ofur@@ in is an experimental chemotherapeutic agent currently undergoing clinical evalu@@ ation@@ . we report our results with magnetic resonance ( m@@ r ) in demonstrating reversible cerebral abnormalities concurrent with the use of this dru@@ g. the abnormalities on m@@ r were correlated with findings on ct as well as with cerebral angi@@ og@@ rap@@ hy@@ . the utility of m@@ r in the evaluation of patients receiving this new agent is illustrated .
antagonism of diazepam @-@ induced sedative effects by ro@@ 15 @-@ 17@@ 88 in patients after surgery under lumbar epidural bloc@@ k@@ . a double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled investigation of efficacy and saf@@ et@@ y@@ . the aim of this study was to assess the efficacy of ro@@ 15 @-@ 17@@ 88 and a placebo in reversing diazepam @-@ induced effects after surgery under epidural block , and to evaluate the local tolerance and general safety of ro@@ 15 @-@ 17@@ 88@@ . fifty @-@ seven patients were sedated with diazepam for surgery under epidural anaes@@ thesi@@ a. antagonism of diazepam @-@ induced effects by ro@@ 15 @-@ 17@@ 88 was investigated postoperatively in a double @-@ blind placebo @-@ controlled tri@@ al@@ . the patient &apos;s subjective assessment of mood rating , an objective test of performance , a test for amnesia , and vital signs were recorded for up to 300 min after administration of the trial dru@@ g. no significant differences between the two groups were observed for mood rating , amnesia , or vital sign@@ s. the ro@@ 15 @-@ 17@@ 88 group showed a significant improvement in the performance test up to 120 min after administration of the dru@@ g. there was no evidence of reaction at the injection site .
enhanced stimulus @-@ induced neurotransmitter overflow in epinephrine @-@ induced hypertensive rats is not mediated by pre@@ junctional beta @-@ adrenoceptor activ@@ ation@@ . the present study examines the effect of 6 @-@ day epinephrine treatment ( 100 micrograms / kg per h , s.c. ) on stimulus @-@ induced ( 1 h@@ z ) endogenous neurotransmitter overflow from the isolated perfused kidney of veh@@ ic@@ le- and epinephrine @-@ treated rat@@ s. renal catecholamine stores and stimulus @-@ induced overflow in the vehicle @-@ treated group consisted of norepinephrine on@@ ly@@ . however , epinephrine treatment resulted in the incorporation of epinephrine into renal catecholamine stores such that approximately 40 % of the catecholamine present was epinephrine while the norepinephrine content was reduced by a similar de@@ gre@@ e. total tissue catecholamine content of the kidney on a molar basis was un@@ chang@@ ed@@ . stimulus @-@ induced fractional overflow of neurotransmitter from the epinephrine @-@ treated kidneys was approximately twice normal and consisted of both norepinephrine and epinephrine in proportions similar to those found in the kidne@@ y@@ . this difference in fractional overflow between groups was not affected by neuronal and extran@@ eur@@ onal uptake bloc@@ k@@ ade@@ . propranolol had no effect on stimulus @-@ induced overflow in either grou@@ p. phentolamine increased stimulus @-@ induced overflow in both groups although the increment in overflow was greater in the epinephrine @-@ treated grou@@ p. in conclusion , chronic epinephrine treatment results in enhanced fractional neurotransmitter over@@ flow@@ . however , neither alterations in pre@@ junctional beta @-@ adrenoceptor influences nor alterations in neuronal and extran@@ eur@@ onal uptake mechanisms appear to be responsible for this alter@@ ation@@ . furthermore , data obtained with phentolamine alone do not suggest alpha @-@ adrenoceptor desensitization as the cause of the enhanced neurotransmitter overflow after epinephrine treatment .
ocular manifestations of juvenile rheumatoid arth@@ ri@@ tis@@ . we followed 210 cases of juvenile rheumatoid arthritis closely for eleven year@@ s. thirty @-@ six of the 210 patients ( 17.2 % ) developed irid@@ ocycl@@ iti@@ s. irid@@ ocycl@@ itis was seen most frequently in young female patients ( 0 to 4 years ) with the mono@@ articular or pauc@@ i@@ atr@@ icular form of the arth@@ ri@@ tis@@ . however , 30 % of the patients developed uveitis after 16 years of ag@@ e. although 61 % of patients had a non@@ contributory ocular history on entry , 42 % had active uveitis on entr@@ y@@ . our approach was effective in detecting uveitis in new cases and exacerbations of uveitis in established cas@@ es@@ . forty @-@ four percent of patients with uveitis had one or more identifiable signs or symptoms , such as red eye , ocular pain , decreased visual acuity , or phot@@ ophobia , in order of decreasing frequ@@ enc@@ y@@ . even after early detection and prompt treatment , 41 % of cases of uveitis did not respond to more than six months of intensive topical treatment with corticosteroids and my@@ dri@@ atic@@ s. despite this , there was a dramatic decrease in the 50 % incidence of blinding complications of uveitis cited in earlier studi@@ es@@ . cataract and band kerat@@ opathy occurred in only 22 and 13 % of our group , respec@@ ti@@ vel@@ y@@ . we used chloroquine or hydroxy@@ chloroquine in 173 of 210 cases and found only one case of chori@@ oretinopathy attributable to these dru@@ g@@ s. systemically administered corticosteroids were used in 75 of 210 cases ; a significant number of posterior subcapsular cataracts was found@@ . typical kerato@@ conjunctivitis sic@@ ca developed in three of the uveitis cas@@ es@@ . this association with uveitis and j@@ ra was not noted previ@@ ous@@ ly@@ . surgical treatment of cataracts , band kerat@@ opathy , and glaucoma achieved uniformly discour@@ aging results .
water intoxication associated with oxytocin administration during saline @-@ induced abor@@ tion@@ . four cases of water intoxication in connection with oxytocin administration during saline @-@ induced abortions are describ@@ ed@@ . the mechanism of water intoxication is discussed in regard to these cas@@ es@@ . oxytocin administration during mid@@ trimester @-@ induced abortions is advocated only if it can be carried out under careful observations of an alert nursing staff , aware of the symptoms of water intoxication and instructed to w@@ atch the diuresis and report such early signs of the syndrome as asthenia , muscular irritability , or head@@ ach@@ es@@ . the oxytocin should be given only in ring@@ ers lactate or , altern@@ ately , in ring@@ ers lactate and a 5 per cent dextrose and water solu@@ tion@@ s. the urinary output should be monitored and the oxytocin administration discontinued and the serum electrolytes checked if the urinary output decre@@ as@@ es@@ . the oxytocin should not be administered in excess of 36 hour@@ s. if the patient has not aborted by then the oxytocin should be discontinued for 10 to 12 hours in order to perform electrolyte determinations and correct any electrolyte imbalance .
