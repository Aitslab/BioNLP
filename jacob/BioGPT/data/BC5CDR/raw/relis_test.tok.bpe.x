antioxidant effects of bovine lactoferrin on dexamethasone @-@ induced hypertension in rat@@ . dex@@ am@@ eth@@ as@@ one- ( dex@@ - ) induced hypertension is associated with enhanced oxidative stress@@ . lactoferrin ( l@@ f ) is an iron @-@ binding glycoprotein with antihypertensive proper@@ ti@@ es@@ . in this study , we investigated the effect of chronic administration of l@@ f on oxidative stress and hypertension upon dex administr@@ ation@@ . male w@@ istar rats were treated by dex ( 30 u g / kg / day subcutaneously ) or saline for 14 day@@ s. oral bovine l@@ f ( 30 , 100 , 300 mg / kg ) was given from day 8 to 14 in a reversal stud@@ y@@ . in a prevention study , rats received 4 days of l@@ f treatment followed by dex and continued during the test period@@ . systolic blood pressure ( s@@ bp ) was measured using tail @-@ cuff method@@ . thymus weight was used as a marker of glucocorticoid activ@@ it@@ y@@ . plasma hydrogen peroxide ( h@@ 2@@ o@@ 2 ) concentration and ferric reducing antioxidant power ( fra@@ p ) value were determin@@ ed@@ . dexamethasone significantly increased s@@ bp and plasma h@@ 2@@ o@@ 2 level and decreased thymus and body weigh@@ ts@@ . l@@ f lowered ( p &lt; 0.01 ) and dose dependently prevented ( p &lt; 0.001 ) dex @-@ induced hyper@@ ten@@ sion@@ . l@@ f prevented body weight loss and significantly reduced the elevated plasma h@@ 2@@ o@@ 2 and increased fra@@ p valu@@ es@@ . chronic administration of l@@ f strongly reduced the blood pressure and production of ro@@ s and improved antioxidant capacity in dex @-@ induced hypertension , suggesting the role of inhibition of oxidative stress as another mechanism of antihypertensive action of l@@ f .
the association between tranexamic acid and convulsive seizures after cardiac surgery : a multivariate analysis in 11 5@@ 29 patient@@ s. because of a lack of contemporary data regarding seizures after cardiac surgery , we undertook a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data from 11 5@@ 29 patients in whom cardiopulmonary bypass was used from j@@ anuary 2004 to dec@@ ember 20@@ 10@@ . a convulsive seizure was defined as a transient episode of disturbed brain function characterised by abnormal involuntary motor mo@@ v@@ ement@@ s. multivariate regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictors of postoperative seiz@@ u@@ res@@ . a total of 100 ( 0.9 % ) patients developed postoperative convulsive seiz@@ u@@ res@@ . generalised and focal seizures were identified in 68 and 32 patients , respec@@ ti@@ vel@@ y@@ . the median ( i@@ q@@ r &#91; range &#93; ) time after surgery when the seizure occurred was 7 ( 6 @-@ 12 &#91; 1 @-@ 216 &#93; ) h and 8 ( 6 @-@ 11 &#91; 4 @-@ 18 &#93; ) h , respec@@ ti@@ vel@@ y@@ . epileptiform findings on electroencephalography were seen in 19 patient@@ s. independent predictors of postoperative seizures included age , female sex , re@@ do cardiac surgery , calcification of ascending aorta , congestive heart failure , deep hypothermic circulatory arrest , duration of aortic cross @-@ clamp and tranexamic acid@@ . when tested in a multivariate regression analysis , tranexamic acid was a strong independent predictor of seizures ( or 14.3 , 95 % ci 5.5 @-@ 36.7 ; p &lt; 0.001 ) . patients with convulsive seizures had 2.5 times higher in @-@ hospital mortality rates and twice the length of hospital stay compared with patients without convulsive seiz@@ u@@ res@@ . mean ( i@@ q@@ r &#91; range &#93; ) length of stay in the intensive care unit was 115 ( 49 @-@ 228 &#91; 32 @-@ 4@@ 81 &#93; ) h in patients with convulsive seizures compared with 26 ( 22 @-@ 69 &#91; 14 @-@ 10@@ 80 &#93; ) h in patients without seizures ( p &lt; 0.001 ) . convulsive seizures are a serious postoperative complication after cardiac surg@@ ery@@ . as tranexamic acid is the only modifiable factor , its administration , particularly in doses exceeding 80 mg.kg ( -1 ) , should be weighed against the risk of postoperative seizures .
dysfunctional overnight memory consolidation in ec@@ st@@ asy us@@ er@@ s. sleep plays an important role in the consolidation and integration of memory in a process called overnight memory consol@@ id@@ ation@@ . previous studies indicate that ec@@ st@@ asy users have marked and persistent neurocognitive and sleep @-@ related impair@@ ment@@ s. we extend past research by examining overnight memory consolidation among regular ec@@ st@@ asy users ( n = 12 ) and drug naive healthy controls ( n = 26 ) . memory recall of word pairs was evaluated before and after a period of sleep , with and without interference prior to tes@@ tin@@ g. in addition , we assessed neurocognitive performances across tasks of learning , memory and executive function@@ ing@@ . ec@@ st@@ asy users demonstrated impaired overnight memory consolidation , a finding that was more pronounced following associative inter@@ feren@@ c@@ e. additionally , ec@@ st@@ asy users demonstrated impairments on tasks recruiting fron@@ to@@ striatal and hippocampal neural circuitry , in the domains of proactive interference memory , long @-@ term memory , encoding , working memory and complex pl@@ ann@@ ing@@ . we suggest that ec@@ st@@ asy @-@ associated dysfunction in fronto @-@ temporal circuitry may underlie overnight consolidation memory impairments in regular ec@@ st@@ asy users .

an integrated characterization of serological , pathological , and functional events in doxorubicin @-@ induced cardi@@ otoxic@@ it@@ y@@ . many efficacious cancer treatments cause significant cardiac morbidity , yet biomarkers or functional indices of early damage , which would allow monitoring and intervention , are lac@@ k@@ ing@@ . in this study , we have utilized a rat model of progressive doxorubicin ( dox ) -induced cardiomyopathy , applying multiple approaches , including cardiac magnetic resonance imaging ( m@@ ri ) , to provide the most comprehensive characterization to date of the tim@@ ec@@ our@@ se of serological , pathological , and functional events underlying this toxic@@ it@@ y@@ . han@@ nover w@@ istar rats were dosed with 1.25 mg / kg dox weekly for 8 weeks followed by a 4 week off @-@ dosing &quot; recovery &quot; period@@ . electron microscopy of the myocardium revealed subcellular degeneration and marked mitochondrial changes after a single dos@@ e. histopathological analysis revealed progressive cardiomyocyte degeneration , hypertrophy / cyt@@ omegaly , and extensive vacuol@@ ation after two dos@@ es@@ . extensive replacement fibrosis ( quantified by si@@ ri@@ us red staining ) developed during the off @-@ dosing period@@ . functional indices assessed by cardiac m@@ ri ( including left ventricular ejection fraction ( l@@ ve@@ f ) , cardiac output , and e / a ratio ) declined progressively , reaching statistical significance after two doses and culmin@@ ating in &quot; clinical &quot; l@@ v dysfunction by 12 week@@ s. significant increases in peak myocardial contrast enhancement and serological cardiac troponin i ( ct@@ ni ) emerged after eight doses , importantly preceding the l@@ ve@@ f decline to &lt; 50 % . troponin i levels positively correlated with delayed and peak gadolinium contrast enhancement , histopathological grading , and diastolic dys@@ function@@ . in summary , subcellular cardiomyocyte degeneration was the earliest marker , followed by progressive functional decline and histopathological manifest@@ ation@@ s. myocardial contrast enhancement and elevations in ct@@ ni occurred later@@ . however , all indices pred@@ ated &quot; clinical &quot; l@@ v dysfunction and thus warrant further evaluation as predictive biomarkers .
intradermal glutamate and capsaicin injections : intra- and interindividual variability of provoked hyperalgesia and allo@@ dy@@ ni@@ a. intradermal injections of glutamate and capsaicin are attractive to use in human experimental pain models because hyperalgesia and allodynia mimic isolated aspects of clinical pain dis@@ or@@ der@@ s. the aim of the present study was to investigate the reproducibility of these mod@@ el@@ s. twenty healthy male volunteers ( mean age 24 years ; range 18 @-@ 38 years ) received intradermal injections of glutamate and capsaicin in the volar fore@@ ar@@ m. magnitudes of secondary pin@@ prick hyperalgesia and brush @-@ evoked allodynia were investigated using von fre@@ y filaments ( g@@ aug@@ es 10 , 15 , 60 and 100 g ) and brush stro@@ k@@ es@@ . areas of secondary hyperalgesia and allodynia were quantified immediately after injection and after 15 , 30 and 60 min@@ . two identical experiments separated by at least 7 days were perfor@@ med@@ . reproducibility across and within volunteers ( inter- and intra @-@ individual variation , respectively ) was assessed using intraclass correlation coefficient ( ic@@ c ) and coefficient of variation ( cv ) . secondary pin@@ prick hyperalgesia was observed as a marked increase in the visual analogue scale ( vas ) response to von fre@@ y g@@ aug@@ es 60 and 100 g ( p &lt; 0.001 ) after glutamate injec@@ tion@@ . for capsaicin , secondary pin@@ prick hyperalgesia was detected with all von fre@@ y g@@ aug@@ es ( p &lt; 0.001 ) . glutamate evoked reproducible vas response to all von fre@@ y g@@ aug@@ es ( ic@@ c &gt; 0.60 ) and brush strokes ( ic@@ c &gt; 0.83 ) . capsaicin injection was reproducible for secondary hyperalgesia ( ic@@ c &gt; 0.70 ) and allodynia ( ic@@ c &gt; 0.71 ) . intra @-@ individual variability was generally lower for the vas response to von fre@@ y and brush compared with areas of secondary hyperalgesia and allo@@ dy@@ ni@@ a. in conclusion , glutamate and capsaicin yield reproducible hyper@@ algesic and allodyn@@ ic responses , and the present model is well suited for basic research , as well as for assessing the modulation of central phenomena .
ocular @-@ specific er stress reduction rescues glaucoma in murine glucocorticoid @-@ induced glauc@@ om@@ a. administration of glucocorticoids induces ocular hypertension in some patient@@ s. if untreated , these patients can develop a secondary glaucoma that resembles primary open @-@ angle glaucoma ( po@@ ag ) . the underlying pathology of glucocorticoid @-@ induced glaucoma is not fully understood , due in part to lack of an appropriate animal mod@@ el@@ . here , we developed a murine model of glucocorticoid @-@ induced glaucoma that exhibits glaucoma features that are observed in patient@@ s. treatment of wt mice with topical ocular 0.1 % dexamethasone led to elevation of intraocular pressure ( i@@ op ) , functional and structural loss of retinal ganglion cells , and axonal degeneration , resembling glucocorticoid @-@ induced glaucoma in human patient@@ s. furthermore , dexamethasone @-@ induced ocular hypertension was associated with chronic er stress of the trabecular meshwork ( t@@ m ) . similar to patients , withdrawal of dexamethasone treatment reduced elevated i@@ op and er stress in this animal mod@@ el@@ . dexamethasone induced the transcriptional factor ch@@ op , a marker for chronic er stress , in the anterior segment tissues , and ch@@ op deletion reduced er stress in these tissues and prevented dexamethasone @-@ induced ocular hyper@@ ten@@ sion@@ . furthermore , reduction of er stress in the t@@ m with sodium 4 @-@ phenyl@@ butyrate prevented dexamethasone @-@ induced ocular hypertension in wt mic@@ e. our data indicate that er stress contributes to glucocorticoid @-@ induced ocular hypertension and suggest that reducing er stress has potential as a therapeutic strategy for treating glucocorticoid @-@ induced glaucoma .

incidence of solid tumours among pesticide applic@@ ators exposed to the organophosphate insecticide diaz@@ in@@ on in the agricultural health study : an updated analy@@ si@@ s. objective : diaz@@ in@@ on , a common organophosphate insecticide with genotoxic properties , was previously associated with lung cancer in the agricultural health study ( a@@ hs ) cohort , but few other epidemiological studies have examined diaz@@ in@@ on @-@ associated cancer ris@@ k@@ . we used updated diaz@@ in@@ on exposure and cancer incidence information to evaluate solid tumour risk in the ah@@ s. methods : male pesticide applic@@ ators in i@@ owa and north caro@@ lina reported lifetime diaz@@ in@@ on use at enrolment ( 1993 @-@ 1997 ) and follow @-@ up ( 1998 @-@ 2005 ) ; cancer incidence was assessed through 2010 ( north caro@@ lina ) / 2011 ( i@@ owa ) . among applic@@ ators with usage information sufficient to evaluate exposure @-@ response patterns , we used pois@@ son regression to estimate adjusted rate ratios ( r@@ rs ) and 95 % ci for cancer sites with &gt; 10 exposed cases for both lifetime ( lt ) exposure days and intensity @-@ weighted ( i@@ w ) lifetime exposure days ( accounting for factors impacting exposure ) . results : we observed elevated lung cancer risks ( n = 283 ) among applic@@ ators with the greatest number of lt ( r@@ r = 1.60 ; 95 % ci 1.11 to 2.31 ; p@@ trend = 0.02 ) and i@@ w days of diaz@@ in@@ on use ( r@@ r = 1.41 ; 95 % ci 0.98 to 2.04 ; p@@ trend = 0.08 ) . kidney cancer ( n = 94 ) risks were non @-@ significantly elevated ( r@@ r@@ lt days = 1.77 ; 95 % ci 0.90 to 3.@@ 51 ; p@@ trend = 0.09 ; r@@ ri@@ w days 1.37 ; 95 % ci 0.64 to 2.@@ 92 ; p@@ trend = 0.50 ) , as were risks for aggressive prostate cancer ( n = 6@@ 56 ) . conclusions : our updated evaluation of diaz@@ in@@ on provides additional evidence of an association with lung cancer ris@@ k@@ . newly identified links to kidney cancer and associations with aggressive prostate cancer require further evaluation .
associations of ozone and p@@ m@@ 2.5 concentrations with parkin@@ son &apos;s disease among participants in the agricultural health stud@@ y@@ . objective : this study describes associations of ozone and fine particulate matter with parkin@@ son &apos;s disease observed among farmers in north caro@@ lina and i@@ ow@@ a. methods : we used logistic regression to determine the associations of these pollutants with self @-@ reported , doctor @-@ diagnosed parkin@@ son &apos;s dise@@ as@@ e. daily predicted pollutant concentrations were used to derive surrogates of long @-@ term exposure and link them to study participants &apos; ge@@ oc@@ oded add@@ res@@ ses@@ . results : we observed positive associations of parkin@@ son &apos;s disease with ozone ( odds ratio = 1.39 ; 95 % ci : 0.98 to 1.98 ) and fine particulate matter ( odds ratio = 1.34 ; 95 % ci : 0.93 to 1.93 ) in north caro@@ lina but not in i@@ ow@@ a. conclusions : the plau@@ sibility of an effect of ambient concentrations of these pollutants on parkin@@ son &apos;s disease risk is supported by experimental data demonstrating damage to dopaminergic neurons at relevant concentr@@ ation@@ s. additional studies are needed to address uncertainties related to confounding and to examine temporal aspects of the associations we observed .
low functional programming of renal at@@ 2@@ r mediates the developmental origin of glomerulosclerosis in adult offspring induced by prenatal caffeine expos@@ ure@@ . un@@ assigned : our previous study has indicated that prenatal caffeine exposure ( p@@ ce ) could induce intrauterine growth retardation ( i@@ ug@@ r ) of off@@ sp@@ ring@@ . recent research suggested that i@@ ug@@ r is a risk factor for glomerul@@ os@@ cler@@ osi@@ s. however , whether p@@ ce could induce glomerulosclerosis and its underlying mechanisms remain un@@ know@@ n@@ . this study aimed to demonstrate the induction to glomerulosclerosis in adult offspring by p@@ ce and its intrauterine programming mechanis@@ m@@ s. a rat model of i@@ ug@@ r was established by p@@ ce , male fetuses and adult offspring at the age of postnatal week 24 were euthan@@ iz@@ ed@@ . the results revealed that the adult offspring kidneys in the p@@ ce group exhibited glomerulosclerosis as well as interstitial fibrosis , accompanied by elevated levels of serum creatinine and urine protein@@ . renal angiotensin ii receptor type 2 ( at@@ 2@@ r ) gene expression in adult offspring was reduced by p@@ ce , whereas the renal angiotensin ii receptor type 1a ( at@@ 1@@ ar ) / at@@ 2@@ r expression ratio was incre@@ as@@ ed@@ . the fetal kidneys in the p@@ ce group displayed an enlarged b@@ ow@@ man &apos;s space and a sh@@ run@@ ken glomerular tu@@ ft , accompanied by a reduced cortex width and an increase in the nephro@@ genic zone / cortical zone rati@@ o. observation by electronic microscope revealed structural damage of podocytes ; the reduced expression level of podocyte marker genes , neph@@ rin and po@@ doc@@ in , was also detected by q @-@ p@@ cr@@ . moreover , at@@ 2@@ r gene and protein expressions in fetal kidneys were inhibited by p@@ ce , associated with the repression of the gene expression of glial @-@ cell @-@ line @-@ derived neurotrophic factor ( g@@ dn@@ f ) / tyrosine kinase receptor ( c @-@ ret ) signaling path@@ w@@ ay@@ . these results demonstrated that p@@ ce could induce dysplasia of fetal kidneys as well as glomerulosclerosis of adult offspring , and the low functional programming of renal at@@ 2@@ r might mediate the developmental origin of adult glomerulosclerosis .
1,3 @-@ but@@ adiene , c@@ ml and the t ( 9 : 22 ) translocation : a reality check@@ . un@@ assigned : epidemiological studies of 1,3 @-@ but@@ adiene have suggest that exposures to humans are associated with chronic myeloid leukemia ( c@@ ml ) . c@@ ml has a well @-@ documented association with ionizing radiation , but reports of associations with chemical exposures have been question@@ ed@@ . ionizing radiation is capable of inducing the requisite c@@ ml @-@ associated t ( 9 : 22 ) translocation ( phil@@ adelphia chromosome ) in appropriate cells in vitro but , thus far , chemicals have not shown this capac@@ it@@ y@@ . we have proposed that 1,3 @-@ but@@ adiene metabolites be so tested as a reality check on the epidemiological repor@@ ts@@ . in order to conduct reliable testing in this regard , it is essential that a positive control for induction be avail@@ ab@@ le@@ . we have used ionizing radiation to develop such a contro@@ l@@ . results described here demonstrate that this agent does in fact induce pathogenic t ( 9 : 22 ) translocations in a human myeloid cell line in vitro , but does so at low frequ@@ enc@@ i@@ es@@ . conditions that will be required for studies of 1,3 @-@ but@@ adiene are discussed .

experimental progressive muscular dystrophy and its treatment with high doses an@@ abol@@ izing ag@@ ent@@ s. we are still a long way from discovering an unequivocal pathogenetic interpretation of progressive muscular dystrophy in man@@ . noteworthy efforts have been made in the experimental field ; a recessive aut@@ os@@ omic form found in the mouse seems to bear the closest resemblance to the human form from the genetic point of view@@ . myopathy due to lack of vitamin e and myopathy induced by certain viruses have much in common anatomically and pathologically with the human form@@ . the authors induced my@@ odystrophy in the rat by giving it a diet lacking in vitamin e. the pharmacological characteristics of vitamin e and the degenerative changes brought about by its deficiency , especially in the muscles , are illustr@@ ated@@ . it is thus confirmed that the histological characteristics of my@@ opathic rat muscle induced experimentally are extra@@ ordinarily similar to those of human myopathy as confirmed during biopsies performed at the orthopaedic traum@@ at@@ ological centre , flo@@ ren@@ c@@ e. the encouraging results obtained in various author@@ at@@ ative departments in my@@ opathic patients by using an@@ abol@@ izing steroids have encouraged the authors to investigate the beneficial effects of one an@@ abol@@ izing agent ( di@@ an@@ ab@@ ol , c@@ ib@@ a ) at high doses in rats rendered my@@ opathic by a diet deficient in vitamin e. in this way they obtained appreciable changes in body weight ( increased from 50 to 70 g after forty days at a dose of 5 mg per day of an@@ abol@@ izing agent ) , but most of all they found histological changes due to &quot; regenerative &quot; changes in the muscle tissue , which however maintained its my@@ opathic characteristics in the control animals that were not treated with the an@@ abol@@ izing ag@@ ent@@ . the authors conclude by affir@@ ming the undoub@@ ted efficacy of the an@@ abol@@ izing steroids in experimental my@@ opathic disease , but they have reser@@ v@@ ations as to the transfer of the results into the human field , where high dosage cannot be carried out continuously because of the effects of the drug on vir@@ ility ; because the tissue injury too often occurs at an irreversible stage vis @-@ a @-@ vis the &quot; regeneration &quot; of the muscle tissue ; and finally because the dystrophic injurious agent is certainly not the lack of vitamin e but something as yet unknown .

acute renal insufficiency after high @-@ dose melphalan in patients with primary systemic amyloidosis during stem cell transpl@@ ant@@ ation@@ . background : patients with primary systemic amyloidosis ( al ) have a poor prog@@ no@@ si@@ s. median survival time from standard treatments is only 17 mon@@ th@@ s. high @-@ dose intravenous melphalan followed by peripheral blood stem cell transplant ( p@@ b@@ sc@@ t ) appears to be the most promising therapy , but treatment mortality can be high@@ . the authors have noted the development of acute renal insufficiency immediately after melphalan condi@@ tion@@ ing@@ . this study was undertaken to further examine its risk factors and impact on posttransplant mortal@@ it@@ y@@ . methods : consecutive al patients who underwent p@@ b@@ sc@@ t were studied retro@@ spec@@ ti@@ vel@@ y@@ . acute renal insufficiency ( ari ) after high @-@ dose melphalan was defined by a minimum increase of 0.5 mg / dl ( 44 micromol / l ) in the serum creatinine level that is greater than 50 % of baseline immediately after condi@@ tion@@ ing@@ . urine sediment score was the sum of the individual types of sediment identified on urine microscop@@ y@@ . results : of the 80 patients studied , ari developed in 18.8 % of the patients after high @-@ dose mel@@ phal@@ an@@ . univariate analysis identified age , hypoalbumin@@ emia , heavy proteinuria , diuretic use , and urine sediment score ( &gt; 3 ) as risk factor@@ s. age and urine sediment score remained independently significant risk factors in the multivariate analy@@ si@@ s. patients who had ari after high @-@ dose melphalan underwent dialysis more often ( p = 0.007 ) , and had a worse 1 @-@ year survival ( p = 0.03 ) . conclusion : the timing of renal injury strongly suggests melphalan as the causative ag@@ ent@@ . ongoing tubular injury may be a prerequisite for renal injury by melphalan as evidenced by the active urinary sedi@@ ment@@ . development of ari adversely affected the outcome after p@@ b@@ sc@@ t. effective preventive measures may help decrease the treatment mortality of p@@ b@@ sc@@ t in al patients .
impaired fear recognition in regular recreational cocaine us@@ er@@ s. introduction : the ability to read facial expressions is essential for normal human social inter@@ action@@ . the aim of the present study was to conduct the first investigation of facial expression recognition performance in recreational cocaine us@@ er@@ s. materials and methods : three groups , comprised of 21 cocaine naive participants ( c@@ n ) , 30 occasional cocaine ( oc ) , and 48 regular recreational cocaine ( r@@ c ) users , were com@@ pa@@ red@@ . an emotional facial expression ( ef@@ e ) task consisting of a male and female face expressing six basic emotions ( happiness , surpr@@ ise , s@@ adness , anger , fear , and dis@@ g@@ ust ) was admini@@ stere@@ d. mean percent accuracy and latencies for correct responses across eight presentations of each basic emotion were deri@@ ve@@ d. participants were also assessed with the &quot; eyes task &quot; to investigate their ability to recognize more complex emotional states and the symptom checklist @-@ 90 @-@ revised to measure psych@@ opath@@ olog@@ y@@ . results : there were no group differences in psychopathology or &quot; eyes task &quot; performance , but the r@@ c group , who otherwise had similar illicit substance use histories to the oc group , exhibited impaired fear recognition accuracy compared to the oc and c@@ n grou@@ ps@@ . the r@@ c group also correctly identified anger , fear , happiness , and surpr@@ ise , more slowly than c@@ n , but not oc particip@@ ant@@ s. the oc group was slower than c@@ n when correctly identifying dis@@ gust@@ . the selective deficit in fear recognition accuracy manifested by the r@@ c group cannot be explained by the subacute effects of cocaine , or ec@@ st@@ asy , because recent and less recent users of these drugs within this group were similarly impa@@ i@@ red@@ . possible parallels between r@@ c users and psych@@ opath@@ s with respect to impaired fear recognition , amygdala dysfunction , and etiology are discussed .

bilateral haemorrhagic infarction of the globus pallidus after cocaine and alcohol intox@@ ic@@ ation@@ . cocaine is a risk factor for both ischemic and haemorrhagic stro@@ ke@@ . we present the case of a 31 @-@ year @-@ old man with bilateral ischemia of the globus pallidus after excessive alcohol and intranasal cocaine use@@ . drug @-@ related globus pallidus infarctions are most often associated with her@@ oin@@ . bilateral basal ganglia infarcts after the use of cocaine , without concurrent heroin use , have never been repor@@ te@@ d. in our patient , transient cardiac arrhythmia or respiratory dysfunction related to cocaine and / or ethanol use were the most likely causes of cerebral hypoperfusion .
acute renal failure after high @-@ dose methotrexate therapy in a patient with ile@@ ost@@ omy@@ . high @-@ dose methotrexate ( h@@ d @-@ mt@@ x ) is an important treatment for bur@@ kitt lymphoma , but can cause hepatic and renal toxicity when its clearance is del@@ ay@@ ed@@ . we report a case of acute renal failure after h@@ d @-@ mt@@ x therapy in a patient with ileostomy , the patient was a 3 @-@ year @-@ old boy who had received a living @-@ related liver transplantation for congenital biliary atresi@@ a. at day 8@@ 33 after the transplantation , he was diagnosed with pt@@ ld ( post @-@ transplantation lymphoproliferative disorder , bur@@ kitt @-@ type malignant lymphoma ) . during induction therapy , he suffered ileal perforation and ileostomy was perfor@@ med@@ . subsequent h@@ d @-@ mt@@ x therapy caused acute renal failure that required continuous hemodi@@ aly@@ si@@ s. we supposed that intravascular hypovol@@ emia due to substantial drainage from the ile@@ ost@@ oma caused acute pre@@ renal fail@@ ure@@ . after recovery of his renal function , we could safely treat the patient with h@@ d @-@ mt@@ x therapy by controlling drainage from ile@@ ost@@ oma with total parenteral nutrition .
antithrombotic drug use , cerebral micro@@ bleeds , and intracerebral hemorrhage : a systematic review of published and unpublished studi@@ es@@ . background and purpose : cerebral micro@@ bleeds ( m@@ b ) are potential risk factors for intracerebral hemorrhage ( ich ) , but it is unclear if they are a contraindication to using antithrombotic dru@@ g@@ s. insights could be gained by pooling data on m@@ b frequency stratified by antithrombotic use in cohorts with ich and ischemic stroke ( is ) / transient ischemic attack ( tia ) . methods : we performed a systematic review of published and unpublished data from cohorts with stroke or tia to compare the presence of m@@ b in : ( 1 ) antithrombotic users vs non@@ antithrombotic users with ich ; ( 2 ) antithrombotic users vs nonusers with is / tia ; and ( 3 ) ich vs ischemic events stratified by antithrombotic use@@ . we also analyzed published and unpublished follow @-@ up data to determine the risk of ich in antithrombotic users with m@@ b@@ . results : in a pooled analysis of 14@@ 60 ich and 38@@ 17 is / tia , m@@ b were more frequent in ich vs is / tia in all treatment groups , but the excess increased from 2.8 ( odds ratio ; range , 2.3 @-@ 3.5 ) in non@@ antithrombotic users to 5.7 ( range , 3.4 @-@ 9.7 ) in antiplatelet users and 8.0 ( range , 3.5 @-@ 17.8 ) in warfarin users ( p difference = 0.01 ) . there was also an excess of m@@ b in warfarin users vs nonusers with ich ( or , 2.7 ; 95 % ci , 1.6 @-@ 4.4 ; p &lt; 0.001 ) but none in warfarin users with is / tia ( or , 1.3 ; 95 % ci , 0.9 @-@ 1.7 ; p = 0.33 ; p difference = 0.01 ) . there was a smaller excess of m@@ b in antiplatelet users vs nonusers with ich ( or , 1.7 ; 95 % ci , 1.3 @-@ 2.3 ; p &lt; 0.001 ) , but findings were similar for antiplatelet users with is / tia ( or , 1.4 ; 95 % ci , 1.2 @-@ 1.7 ; p &lt; 0.001 ; p difference = 0.25 ) . in pooled follow @-@ up data for 7@@ 68 antithrombotic users , presence of m@@ b at baseline was associated with a substantially increased risk of subsequent ich ( or , 12.1 ; 95 % ci , 3.4 @-@ 42.5 ; p &lt; 0.001 ) . conclusions : the excess of m@@ b in warfarin users with ich compared to other groups suggests that m@@ b increase the risk of warfarin @-@ associated ich@@ . limited prospective data corroborate these findings , but larger prospective studies are urgently required .
verapamil stimulation test in hyperprolactinemia : loss of prolactin response in anatomic or functional stalk effec@@ t. aim : verapamil stimulation test was previously investigated as a tool for differential diagnosis of hyperprolactinemia , but with conflicting resul@@ ts@@ . macro@@ prolactin@@ emia was never considered in those previous studi@@ es@@ . here , we aimed to re @-@ investigate the diagnostic value of verapamil in a population who were all screened for macro@@ prolactin@@ em@@ i@@ a. prolactin responses to verapamil in 65 female patients ( age : 29.9 + / - 8.1 years ) with hyperprolactinemia were tested in a descriptive , matched case @-@ control stud@@ y@@ . methods : verapamil 80 mg , p.o. was administered , and then pr@@ l levels were measured at 8th and 16@@ th hours , by immun@@ ometric chemil@@ umin@@ esc@@ enc@@ e. verapamil responsiveness was determined by peak percent change in basal prolactin levels ( pr@@ l ) . results : verapamil significantly increased pr@@ l levels in healthy controls ( n . 8 , pr@@ l : 183 % ) , macro@@ prolactin@@ oma ( n . 8 , pr@@ l : 7 % ) , micro@@ prolactin@@ oma ( n . 19 , pr@@ l : 21 % ) , macro@@ prolactin@@ emia ( n . 23 , pr@@ l : 126 % ) , but not in pseudo@@ prolactin@@ oma ( n . 8 , pr@@ l : 0.8 % ) , and risperidone @-@ induced hyperprolactinemia ( n . 7 , pr@@ l : 3 % ) . ro@@ c curve analysis revealed that unresponsiveness to verapamil defined as pr@@ l &lt; 7 % , discriminated anatomical or functional stalk effect ( sensitivity : 74 % , specificity : 73 % , au@@ c : 0.8@@ 55 + / -@@ 0.04 , p &lt; 0.001 , ci : 0.7@@ 68 @-@ 0.9@@ 42 ) associated with pseudo@@ prolactin@@ oma or risperidone @-@ induced hyperprolactinemia , respec@@ ti@@ vel@@ y@@ . conclusion : verapamil responsiveness is not a reliable finding for the differential diagnosis of hyperprolactin@@ em@@ i@@ a. however , verapamil unresponsiveness discrimin@@ ates stalk effect ( i.e. , anatomically or functionally inhibited dopaminergic ton@@ us ) from other causes of hyperprolactinemia with varying degrees of responsiveness .
central action of narcotic analge@@ sic@@ s. part iv@@ . noradrenergic influences on the activity of analgesics in rat@@ s. the effect of clonidine , nap@@ haz@@ oline and xyl@@ omet@@ azoline on analgesia induced by morphine , codeine , fentanyl and pent@@ azocine , and on catal@@ eptic effect of morphine , co@@ dine and fentanyl was studied in rat@@ s. the biochemical assays on the influence of four analgesics on the brain concentration and turnover of noradrenaline ( na ) were also perfor@@ med@@ . it was found that three drugs stimulating central na receptors failed to affect the analgesic ed@@ 50 of all antinociceptive agents and they enhanced catal@@ epsy induced by morphine and fentan@@ yl@@ . codeine catal@@ epsy was increased by clonidine and decreased by nap@@ haz@@ oline and xyl@@ omet@@ azol@@ ine@@ . the brain concentration of na was not changed by morphine and fentanyl , but one of the doses of codeine ( 45 mg / kg ) slightly enhanced it@@ . pent@@ azocine dose @-@ dependently decreased the brain level of na@@ . the rate of na turnover was not altered by analgesics except for the higher dose of fentanyl ( 0.2 mg / kg ) following which the disappearance of na from the brain was dimin@@ is@@ he@@ d. the results are discussed in the light of various and non @-@ uniform data from the liter@@ at@@ ure@@ . it is suggested that in rats the brain na plays a less important function than the other mono@@ amines in the behavioural activity of potent analgesics .

pure red cell aplasia , toxic dermatitis and lymphadenopathy in a patient taking diphenyl@@ hyd@@ ant@@ oin@@ . a patient taking diphenyl@@ hyd@@ antoin for 3 weeks developed a generalized skin rash , lymphadenopathy and pure red cell a@@ plasi@@ a. after withdrawal of the pharmac@@ on all symptoms disappeared spont@@ ane@@ ous@@ ly@@ . skin rash is a well @-@ known complication of diphenyl@@ hyd@@ antoin treatment as is benign and malignant lymphaden@@ opath@@ y@@ . pure red cell aplasia associated with diphenyl@@ hyd@@ antoin medication has been reported in 3 patient@@ s. the exact mechanism by which diphenyl@@ hyd@@ antoin exerts its toxic effects is not know@@ n@@ . in this patient the time relation between the ingestion of diphenyl@@ hyd@@ antoin and the occurrence of the skin rash , lymphadenopathy and pure red cell aplasia is very suggestive of a direct connection .
continuous infusion tobramycin combined with carb@@ en@@ icillin for infections in cancer patient@@ s. the cure rate of infections in cancer patients is adversely affected by neutropenia ( less than 1,000 / mm3 ) . in particular , patients with severe neutropenia ( less than 100 / mm3 ) have shown a poor response to antibio@@ tic@@ s. to overcome the adverse effects of neutropenia , tobramycin was given by continuous infusion and combined with intermittent carb@@ en@@ icil@@ lin@@ . tobramycin was given to a total daily dose of 300 mg / m2 and carb@@ en@@ icillin was given at a dose of 5 gm every four hour@@ s. there were 125 infectious episodes in 116 cancer patients receiving myel@@ osuppressive chemo@@ therap@@ y@@ . the overall cure rate was 70 % . pneumonia was the most common infection and 61 % of 59 episodes were c@@ ure@@ d. gram @-@ negative bacilli were the most common causative organisms and 69 % of these infections were c@@ ure@@ d. the most common pathogen was k@@ leb@@ siella pneumoniae and this , together with es@@ ch@@ er@@ ichia coli and pseud@@ omonas aeruginosa , accounted for 74 % of all gram @-@ negative bac@@ illary infec@@ tion@@ s. response was not influenced by the initial neutrophil count , with a 62 % cure rate for 39 episodes associated with severe neutrop@@ eni@@ a. however , failure of the neutrophil count to increase during therapy adversely affected respon@@ se@@ . az@@ ot@@ emia was the major side effect recognized , and it occurred in 11 % of episod@@ es@@ . major az@@ ot@@ emia ( serum creatinine greater than 2.5 mg / dl or bu@@ n greater than 50 mg / dl ) occurred in only 2 % . az@@ ot@@ emia was not related to duration of therapy or serum tobramycin concentr@@ ation@@ . this antibiotic regimen showed both therapeutic efficacy and acceptable renal toxicity for these patients .
recurrent subarachnoid hemorrhage associated with amin@@ oc@@ apro@@ ic acid therapy and acute renal artery thrombo@@ si@@ s. case repor@@ t. epsilon amin@@ oc@@ apro@@ ic acid ( e@@ aca ) has been used to prevent rebleeding in patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage ( sa@@ h ) . although this agent does decrease the frequency of rebleeding , several reports have described thrombotic complications of e@@ aca therap@@ y@@ . these complications have included clinical deterioration and intracranial vascular thrombosis in patients with sa@@ h , arteriolar and capillary fibrin thrombi in patients with fibrinolytic syndromes treated with e@@ aca , or other thromboembolic phenomen@@ a. since intravascular fibrin thrombi are often observed in patients with fibrinolytic disorders , e@@ aca should not be implicated in the pathogenesis of fibrin thrombi in patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation or other &quot; consumption coagul@@ opathies . &quot; this report describes subtotal infarction of the kidney due to thrombosis of a normal renal arter@@ y@@ . this occlusion occurred after e@@ aca therapy in a patient with sa@@ h and histopathological documentation of recurrent sa@@ h@@ . the corresponding clinical event was characterized by marked hypertension and abrupt neurological deterioration .
long @-@ term propranolol therapy in pregnancy : maternal and fetal outcom@@ e. propranolol , a beta @-@ adrenergic blocking agent , has found an important position in the practice of medic@@ ine@@ . its use in pregnancy , however , is an open question as a number of detrimental side effects have been reported in the fetus and neon@@ at@@ e. ten patients and 12 pregnancies are reported where chronic propranolol has been admini@@ stere@@ d. five patients with serial pregnancies with and without propranolol therapy are also examin@@ ed@@ . maternal , fetal , and neonatal complications are examin@@ ed@@ . an attempt is made to differentiate drug @-@ related complications from maternal dise@@ ase@@ --@@ related complic@@ ation@@ s. we conclude that previously reported hypoglycemia , hyperbilirubinemia , polycythemia , neonatal apnea , and bradycardia are not invari@@ able and cannot be statistically correlated with chronic propranolol therap@@ y@@ . growth retardation , however , appears to be significant in both of our series .
use of propranolol in the treatment of idiopathic orthostatic hypot@@ en@@ sion@@ . five patients with idiopathic orthostatic hypotension who had physiologic and biochemical evidence of severe autonomic dysfunction were included in the stud@@ y@@ . they all exhibited markedly reduced plasma catecholamines and plasma renin activity in both recumb@@ ent and upright positions and had marked hypersensitivity to the pressor effects of infused nore@@ pin@@ eph@@ r@@ ine@@ . treatment with propan@@ olol administered intravenously ( 1 @-@ 5 mg ) produced increases in supine and upright blood pressure in 4 of the 5 individuals with rises ranging from 11 / 6 to 22 / 11 mm@@ h@@ g. chronic oral administration of propranolol ( 40 @-@ 160 mg / day ) also elevated the blood pressures of these individuals with increases in the order of 20 @-@ 35 / 15 @-@ 25 m@@ mg being obser@@ ve@@ d. in 1 patient , marked hypertension was induced by propranolol and the drug had to be withdraw@@ n@@ . it otherwise was well tolerated and no important side effects were obser@@ ve@@ d. treatment has been continued in 3 individuals for 6 @-@ 13 months with persistence of the pressor effect , although there appears to have been some decrease in the degree of response with time@@ . hemodynamic measurements in 1 of the patients demonstrated an increase in total peripheral resistance and essentially no change in cardiac output following propranolol therap@@ y@@ . the studies suggest that propranolol is a useful drug in selected patients with severe idiopathic orthostatic hypotension .
total intravenous anesthesia with etom@@ id@@ at@@ e. i@@ i@@ i. some observations in adul@@ ts@@ . an investigation was undertaken to determine the dosage of etom@@ idate required to maintain sleep in adults undergoing surgery under regional local anesthesi@@ a. premedication of diazepam 10 mg and atropine 0.5 mg was given , and sleep was induced and maintained by intermittent intravenous injections of etom@@ idate 0.1 / mg / kg , given whenever the patient would open his eyes on requ@@ est@@ . a mean overall dose of etom@@ idate 17.4 microgram / kg / min@@ . was required to maintain sleep , but great individual variation occurred , with older patients requiring less dru@@ g. the investigation was discontinued after 18 patients because of the frequency and intensity of side @-@ effects , particularly pain and myocl@@ onia , which caused the technique to be abandoned in two cas@@ es@@ . it is considered unlikely that etom@@ idate will prove to be the hypnotic of choice for a totally intravenous anesthetic technique in adults because of the high incidence of myocl@@ onia after prolonged administr@@ ation@@ . in several patients un@@ controllable muscle movements persisted for many minutes after complete recovery of consciousness .
a method for the measurement of tremor , and a comparison of the effects of toc@@ olytic beta @-@ mim@@ e@@ tic@@ s. a method permitting measurement of finger tremor as a displacement @-@ time curve is described , using a test system with simple amplitude calib@@ ration@@ . the coordinates of the inversion points of the displacement @-@ time curves were transferred through graphical input equipment to pun@@ ched tap@@ e. by means of a computer program , periods and amplitudes of tremor oscillations were calculated and classi@@ fi@@ ed@@ . the event frequency for each class of periods and amplitudes was determin@@ ed@@ . the actions of fen@@ oter@@ ol @-@ hydro@@ bromide , rit@@ od@@ rin @-@ h@@ cl and placebo given to 10 healthy subjects by intravenous infusion in a double @-@ blind crossover study were tested by this method@@ . at therapeutic doses both substances raised the mean tremor amplitude to about three times the control lev@@ el@@ . at the same time , the mean period within each class of amplitudes shortened by 10@@ --@@ 20 ms , whereas the mean periods calculated from all oscillations together did not change signific@@ ant@@ ly@@ . after the end of fen@@ oter@@ ol @-@ hydro@@ bromide infusion , tremor amplitudes decreased significantly faster than those following rit@@ od@@ rin @-@ h@@ cl infusion .

kal@@ i@@ uretic effect of l @-@ dopa treatment in parkinsonian patient@@ s. hypokalemia , sometimes severe , was observed in some l @-@ dopa @-@ treated parkinsonian patient@@ s. the influence of l @-@ dopa on the renal excretion of potassium was studied in 3 patients with hypokalemia and in 5 normo@@ kal@@ emic patients by determination of renal plasma flow , glomerular filtration rate , plasma concentration of potassium and sodium as well as urinary excretion of potassium , sodium and aldosteron@@ e. l @-@ dopa intake was found to cause an increased excretion of potassium , and sometimes also of sodium , in the hypo@@ kal@@ emic but not in the normo@@ kal@@ emic patient@@ s. this effect on the renal function could be prohib@@ ited by the administration of a peripheral dopa dec@@ arb@@ od@@ ylase inhibit@@ or@@ . it is not known why this effect occurred in some individuals but not in others , but our results indicate a correlation between aldosterone production and this renal effect of l @-@ dopa .
phenytoin encephalopathy as probable idi@@ osyn@@ cr@@ atic reaction : case repor@@ t. a case of phenytoin ( d@@ ph ) encephalopathy with increasing seizures and e@@ eg and mental changes is describ@@ ed@@ . despite adequate oral dosage of d@@ ph ( 5 mg / kg / daily ) the plasma level was very low ( 2.8 microgram@@ g / ml ) . the encephalopathy was probably an idi@@ osyn@@ cr@@ atic and not toxic or allergic re@@ action@@ . in fact the concentration of free d@@ ph was normal , the patient presented a retarded morb@@ ill@@ iform rash during d@@ ph treatment , the pro@@ tid@@ ogram was normal , and an intrad@@ er@@ mic d@@ ph injection had no local effec@@ t. the authors conclude that in a patient starting d@@ ph treatment an unexpected increase in seizures , with e@@ eg and mental changes occurring simultaneously , should alert the physician to the possible need for eliminating d@@ ph from the therapeutic regimen , even if plasma concentrations are low .
effects of exercise on the severity of isoproterenol @-@ induced myocardial infarc@@ tion@@ . the effect of exercise on the severity of isoproterenol @-@ induced myocardial infarction was studied in male rat@@ s. ninety @-@ three rats were randomly divided into three grou@@ ps@@ . the exercise @-@ isoproterenol ( e @-@ 1 ) and exercise control ( e@@ c ) groups exercised daily for thirty days on a treadmill at 1 mp@@ h , 2 % grade while animals of the sedentary @-@ isoproterenol ( s @-@ i ) group remained se@@ dent@@ ary@@ . eight animals were assigned to the sedentary control ( sc ) group which remained sedentary throughout the experimental period@@ . forty @-@ eight hours after the final exercise period , s @-@ i and e @-@ i animals received a single subcutaneous injection of isoproterenol ( 250 mg / kg body weight ) . animals of the s @-@ i group exhibited significantly ( pp less than 0.05 ) greater mortality from the effects of isoproterenol than animals of the e @-@ i grou@@ p. serum cp@@ k activity for e @-@ i animals was significantly ( p less than 0.05 ) greater than for animals in the s @-@ i and e@@ c groups twenty hours following isoproterenol injec@@ tion@@ . no statistically significant differences were observed between the two isoproterenol treated groups for severity of the induced lesions , changes in heart weight , or heart weight to body weight rati@@ os@@ . the results indicated that exercise reduced the mortality associated with the effects of large dosages of isoproterenol but had little on the severity of the infarction .

paraplegia following intrathecal methotrexate : report of a case and review of the liter@@ at@@ ure@@ . a patient who developed paraplegia following the intrathecal instillation of methotrexate is disc@@ rib@@ ed@@ . the ten previously reported cases of this unusual complication are revie@@ wed@@ . the following factors appear to predispose to the development of this complication : abnormal cerebrospinal dynamics related to the presence of central nervous system leukemia , and epidural cerebrospinal leakage ; elevated cerebrospinal fluid meth@@ oth@@ ex@@ ate concentration related to abnormal cerebrospinal fluid dynamics and to inappropriately high methotrexate doses based on body surface area calculations in older children and adults ; the presence of neurotoxic preserv@@ atives in commercially available methotrexate preparations and dilu@@ ents ; and the use of methotrexate dilu@@ ents of un@@ physiologic ph , ionic content and osmol@@ ar@@ it@@ y@@ . the role of methotrexate contaminants , local folate deficiency , and cranial irradiation in the pathogenesis of intrathecal methotrexate toxicity is un@@ cl@@ ear@@ . the incidence of neurotoxicity may be reduced by employing lower doses of methotrexate in the presence of central nervous system leukemia , in older children and adults , and in the presence of epidural leak@@ ag@@ e. only preservative @-@ free methotrexate in el@@ li@@ ot@@ t &apos;s b solution at a concentration of not more than 1 mg / ml should be used for intrathecal administr@@ ation@@ . periodic monitoring of cerebr@@ usp@@ inal fluid methotrexate levels may be predictive of the development of serious neurotoxicity .
centrally mediated cardiovascular effects of intrac@@ ist@@ ernal application of carbachol in anesthetized rat@@ s. the pressor response to the intrac@@ ist@@ ernal ( i.@@ c. ) injection of carbachol ( 1 mug ) in anesthetized rats was analy@@ z@@ ed@@ . this response was significantly reduced by the intravenous ( i.v. ) injection of guan@@ eth@@ idine ( 5 mg ) , hexam@@ ethonium ( 10 mg ) or phentolamine ( 5 mg ) , and conversely , potentiated by i.v. des@@ methyl@@ imipramine ( 0.3 mg ) , while propranolol ( 0.5 mg ) i.v. selectively inhibited the enlargement of pulse pressure and the tachycardia following i.@@ c. carbachol ( 1 mug ) . on the other hand , the pressor response to i.@@ c. carbachol ( 1 mug ) was almost completely blocked by i.@@ c. atropine ( 3 mug ) or hexam@@ ethonium ( 500 mug ) , and significantly reduced by i.@@ c. chlorpromazine ( 50 mug ) but significantly potentiated by i.@@ c. des@@ methyl@@ imipramine ( 30 mug ) . the pressor response to i.@@ c. carbachol ( 1 mug ) remained unchanged after sectioning of the bilateral cervical vagal nerves but disappeared after sectioning of the spinal cord ( c@@ 7 @-@ c@@ 8 ) . from the above result it is suggested that the pressor response to i.@@ c. carbachol or@@ tral and peripheral adrenergic mechanisms , and that the sympathetic trunk is the main pathway .
hyperglycemic effect of amino compounds structurally related to capro@@ ate in rat@@ s. the chronic feeding of small amounts ( 0.3 @-@ 3 % of diet weight ) of certain amino derivatives of capro@@ ate resulted in hyperglycemia , an elevated glucose tolerance curve and , occasionally , glucos@@ ur@@ i@@ a. effective compounds included nor@@ leucine , nor@@ valine , glutamate , epsilon @-@ amin@@ oc@@ apro@@ ate , methionine , and leucine .
fatty liver induced by tetracycline in the rat@@ . dose @-@ response relationships and effect of sex@@ . dose @-@ response relationships , biochemical mechanisms , and sex differences in the experimental fatty liver induced by tetracycline were studied in the intact rat and with the isolated perfused rat liver in vit@@ ro@@ . in the intact male and female rat , no direct relationship was observed between dose of tetracycline and hepatic accumulation of triglyceri@@ de@@ . with provision of adequate oleic acid as a substrate for the isolated perfused liver , a direct relationship was observed between dose of tetracycline and both accumulation of triglyceride in the liver and depression of output of triglyceride by livers from male and female rat@@ s. marked differences were observed between female and male rats with regard to base line ( control ) hepatic concentration of triglyceride and output of triglyceri@@ de@@ . accumulation of hepatic triglyceride , as a per cent of control values , in response to graded doses of tetracycline , did not differ significantly between male , female and pregnant rat li@@ vers@@ . however , livers from female , and especially pregnant female rats , were strikingly resistant to the effects of tetracycline on depression of output of triglyceride under these experimental condi@@ tion@@ s. these differences between the sexes could not be related to altered disposition of tetracycline or altered uptake of oleic acid@@ . depressed hepatic secretion of triglyceride accounted only for 30 to 50 % of accumulated hepatic triglyceride , indicating that additional mechanisms must be involved in the production of the triglyceride @-@ rich fatty liver in response to tetracycline .

progesterone potentiation of bupivacaine arrhyth@@ m@@ ogenicity in pentobarbital @-@ anesthetized rats and beating rat heart cell cul@@ tu@@ res@@ . the effects of progesterone treatment on bupivacaine arrhyth@@ m@@ ogenicity in beating rat heart myocyte cultures and on anesthetized rats were determin@@ ed@@ . after determining the bupivacaine ad@@ 50 ( the concentration of bupivacaine that caused 50 % of all beating rat heart myocyte cultures to become arrhythmic ) , we determined the effect of 1 @-@ hour progesterone h@@ cl exposure on myocyte contractile rhyth@@ m. each concentration of progesterone ( 6.25 , 12.5 , 25 , and 50 micrograms / ml ) caused a significant and concentration @-@ dependent reduction in the ad@@ 50 for bup@@ ivac@@ ain@@ e. estradiol treatment also increased the arrhyth@@ m@@ ogenicity of bupivacaine in myocyte cultures , but was only one fourth as potent as prog@@ ester@@ on@@ e. neither progesterone nor estradiol effects on bupivacaine arrhyth@@ m@@ ogenicity were potentiated by ep@@ in@@ eph@@ r@@ ine@@ . chronic progesterone pretreatment ( 5 mg / kg / day for 21 days ) caused a significant increase in bupivacaine arrhyth@@ m@@ ogenicity in intact pentobarbital @-@ anesthetized rat@@ s. there was a significant decrease in the time to onset of arrhythmia as compared with control non@@ progesterone @-@ treated rats ( 6.2 + / - 1.3 vs. 30.8 + / - 2.5 min , mean + / - se ) . the results of this study indicate that progesterone can potentiate bupivacaine arrhyth@@ m@@ ogenicity both in vivo and in vit@@ ro@@ . potentiation of bupivacaine arrhythmia in myocyte cultures suggests that this effect is at least partly mediated at the myocyte level .
acute renal failure occurring during intravenous des@@ ferri@@ oxamine therapy : recovery after haem@@ odi@@ aly@@ si@@ s. a patient with transfusion @-@ dependent thalassemia was undergoing home intravenous des@@ ferri@@ oxamine ( d@@ f@@ x ) treatment by means of a totally implanted system because of his poor compliance with the n@@ ightly subcutaneous therap@@ y@@ . due to an accidental mal@@ functioning of the infusion pump , the patient was inadver@@ tently administered a toxic dosage of the drug which caused renal insuffici@@ enc@@ y@@ . given the progressive deterioration of the symptoms and of the laboratory values , despite adequate medical treatment , a decision was made to introduce haem@@ odi@@ aly@@ tical therapy in order to remove the drug and therapy reduce the nephro@@ toxic@@ it@@ y@@ . from the results obtained , haemodialysis can therefore be suggested as a useful therapy in rare cases of progressive acute renal failure caused by des@@ ferri@@ oxamine .
neuroleptic @-@ associated hyperprolactin@@ em@@ i@@ a. can it be treated with bromocriptine ? six stable psychiatric outpatients with hyperprolactinemia and amenorrhea / olig@@ omen@@ orrhea associated with their neuroleptic medications were treated with brom@@ ocrip@@ ti@@ ne@@ . daily dosages of 5 @-@ 10 mg corrected the hyperprolactinemia and restored menstruation in four of the six patient@@ s. one woman , however , developed worsened psychiatric symptoms while taking bromocriptine , and it was discontinu@@ ed@@ . thus , three of six patients had their menstrual irregularity successfully corrected with brom@@ ocrip@@ ti@@ ne@@ . this suggests that bromocriptine should be further evaluated as potential therapy for neuroleptic @-@ associated hyperprolactinemia and amenorrhea / galac@@ tor@@ rhea .
eth@@ acr@@ yn@@ ic acid @-@ induced convulsions and brain neurotransmitters in mic@@ e. intracerebroventricular injection of eth@@ acr@@ yn@@ ic acid ( 50 % convulsive dose ; 50 micrograms / mouse ) accelerated the synthesis / turnover of 5 @-@ hydroxytryptamine ( 5 @-@ h@@ t ) but suppressed the synthesis of gamma @-@ aminobutyric acid and acetylcholine in mouse bra@@ in@@ . these effects were completely antagonized by pretreatment with a glutamate / n @-@ methyl @-@ d @-@ aspartate antagonist , amin@@ ophosph@@ on@@ oval@@ eric acid@@ . in eth@@ acr@@ yn@@ ic acid @-@ induced convulsions , these neurotransmitter systems may be differentially modulated , probably through activation of glut@@ aminergic neurons in the brain .

recurrent myocardial infarction in a postpartum patient receiving brom@@ ocrip@@ ti@@ ne@@ . myocardial infarction in puer@@ peri@@ um is infrequently repor@@ te@@ d. spasm , coronary dissection , or ather@@ omatous etiology has been describ@@ ed@@ . bromocriptine has been implicated in several previous case reports of myocardial infarction in the puer@@ peri@@ um@@ . our case ( including an inadvertent re@@ challenge ) suggests such a relationsh@@ ip@@ . although generally regarded as &quot; safe , &quot; possible serious cardiac effects of bromocriptine should be acknowledged .
ast@@ eri@@ x@@ is induced by carbamazepine therap@@ y@@ . there are very few reports about ast@@ eri@@ x@@ is as a side effect of treatment with psychopharmac@@ ologic ag@@ ent@@ s. in this report we present four patients treated with a combination of different psychotropic drugs , in whom ast@@ eri@@ x@@ is was triggered either by adding carbamazepine ( c@@ b@@ z ) to a treatment regimen , or by increasing its dos@@ ag@@ e. neither dosage nor serum levels of c@@ b@@ z were in a higher rang@@ e. we consider ast@@ eri@@ x@@ is to be an easily overlooked sign of neurotoxicity , which may occur even at low or moderate dosage levels , if certain drugs as lithium or clozapine are used in combination with c@@ b@@ z .
pharmacodynamics of the hypotensive effect of levodopa in parkinsonian patient@@ s. blood pressure effects of i.v. levodopa were examined in parkinsonian patients with stable and fluctuating responses to lev@@ od@@ opa@@ . the magnitude of the hypotensive effect of levodopa was concentration dependent and was fit to an em@@ ax model in fluctuating respon@@ der@@ s. stable responders demonstrated a small hypotensive respon@@ se@@ . baseline blood pressures were higher in fluctuating patients ; a higher baseline blood pressure correlated with greater hypotensive effec@@ ts@@ . anti@@ parkinsonian effects of levodopa temporally correlated with blood pressure chang@@ es@@ . phenylalanine , a large neutral amino acid ( l@@ na@@ a ) competing with levodopa for transport across the blood @-@ brain barrier , reduced the hypotensive and anti@@ parkinsonian effects of lev@@ od@@ opa@@ . we conclude that levodopa has a central hypotensive action that parallels the motor effects in fluctuating patient@@ s. the hypotensive effect appears to be related to the higher baseline blood pressure we observed in fluctuating patients relative to stable patients .

topical 0.025 % capsaicin in chronic post @-@ herpetic neuralgia : efficacy , predictors of response and long @-@ term cour@@ se@@ . in order to evaluate the efficacy , time @-@ course of action and predictors of response to topical capsaicin , 39 patients with chronic post @-@ herpetic neuralgia ( ph@@ n ) , median duration 24 months , were treated with 0.025 % capsaicin cream for 8 week@@ s. during therapy the patients rated their pain on a visual analogue scale ( vas ) and a verbal outcome scal@@ e. a follow @-@ up investigation was performed 10 @-@ 12 months after study onset on the patients who had impro@@ ve@@ d. nineteen patients ( 4@@ 8.7 % ) substantially improved after the 8 @-@ week trial ; 5 ( 12.8 % ) discontinued therapy due to side @-@ effects such as int@@ oler@@ able capsaicin @-@ induced burning sensations ( 4 ) or mastitis ( 1 ) ; 15 ( 38.5 % ) reported no bene@@ fit@@ . the decrease in vas ratings was significant after 2 weeks of continuous applic@@ ation@@ . of the responders 7@@ 2.2 % were still improved at the follow @-@ up ; only one @-@ third of them had continued application ir@@ regul@@ ar@@ ly@@ . treatment effect was not dependent on patient &apos;s age , duration or localization of ph@@ n ( trigeminal involvement was excluded ) , sensory disturbance or pain character@@ . treatment response was not correlated with the incidence , time @-@ course or severity of capsaicin @-@ induced bur@@ n@@ ing@@ . if confirmed in controlled trials , the long @-@ term results of this open , non @-@ randomized study might indicate that the analgesic effect of capsaicin in ph@@ n is mediated by both interference with neuropeptide metabolism and morphological changes ( perhaps degeneration ) of nociceptive afferents .
serotonin reuptake inhibitors , par@@ ano@@ ia , and the ventral basal gangli@@ a. antidepressants have previously been associated with paranoid reactions in psychiatric patient@@ s. five cases of paranoid exacerbation with the serotonin reuptake inhibitors fluoxetine and amitriptyline are reported here@@ . elements common to these cases included a history of paranoid symptomatology and the concomitant occurrence of depressive and psychotic symptom@@ s. complicated depressive disorders ( including atyp@@ ic@@ ality of course and symptomatology , chronicity , psychosis , bi@@ polarity , and secondary onset in the course of a primary psychosis ) may present particular vulnerability to paranoid exacerbations associated with serotonin reuptake inhibit@@ or@@ s. although the pharmacology and neurobiology of par@@ ano@@ ia remain cryptic , several mechanisms , including 5@@ ht@@ 3 receptor @-@ mediated dopamine release , beta @-@ noradrenergic receptor downregulation , or gab@@ ab receptor upregulation acting in the vicinity of the ventral basal ganglia ( possibly in lateral orbitofrontal or anterior cingulate circuits ) , might apply to this phenomen@@ on@@ . these cases call attention to possible paranoid exacerbations with serotonin reuptake blockers in select patients and raise neurobiological considerations regarding par@@ ano@@ ia .
five cases of encephalitis during treatment of lo@@ iasis with diethyl@@ carbam@@ az@@ ine@@ . five cases of encephalitis following treatment with diethyl@@ carbam@@ azine ( de@@ c ) were observed in cong@@ ol@@ ese patients with lo@@ a lo@@ a filari@@ asi@@ s. two cases had a fatal outcome and one resulted in severe sequel@@ a@@ e. the notable fact was that this complication occurred in three patients hospitalized before treatment began , with whom particularly strict therapeutic precautions were taken , i.e. , initial dose less than 10 mg of de@@ c , very gradual dose increases , and associated anti @-@ allergic treat@@ ment@@ . this type of drug @-@ induced complication may not be that uncommon in highly endemic regi@@ on@@ s. it occurs primarily , but not exclusively , in subjects presenting with a high micro@@ filarial load@@ . the relationship between the occurrence of encephalitis and the decrease in micro@@ fil@@ are@@ mia is evid@@ ent@@ . the pathophysiological mechanisms are discussed in the light of these observations and the few other comments on this subject published in the literature .
delirium in an elderly woman possibly associated with administration of misoprost@@ ol@@ . misoprostol has been associated with adverse reactions , including gastrointestinal symptoms , gynecologic problems , and head@@ ac@@ he@@ . changes in mental status , however , have not been repor@@ te@@ d. we present a case in which an 89 @-@ year @-@ old woman in a long @-@ term care facility became confused after the initiation of misoprostol therap@@ y@@ . the patient &apos;s change in mental status was first reported nine days after the initiation of therap@@ y@@ . her delirium significantly improved after misoprostol was discontinued and her mental status returned to normal within a week@@ . because no other factors related to this patient changed significantly , the delirium experienced by this patient possibly resulted from misoprostol therapy .
hepatocellular oxidant stress following intestinal ischemia @-@ reperfusion injur@@ y@@ . reperfusion of ischemic intestine results in acute liver dysfunction characterized by hepatocellular enzyme release into plasma , reduction in bile flow rate , and neutrophil sequestration within the li@@ ver@@ . the pathophysiology underlying this acute hepatic injury is un@@ know@@ n@@ . this study was undertaken to determine whether oxidants are associated with the hepatic injury and to determine the relative value of several indirect methods of assessing oxidant exposure in viv@@ o. rats were subjected to a standardized intestinal ischemia @-@ reperfusion injur@@ y@@ . hepatic tissue was assayed for lipid peroxidation products and oxidized and reduced glut@@ ath@@ ion@@ e. there was no change in hepatic tissue total glutathione following intestinal ischemia @-@ reperfusion injur@@ y@@ . oxidized glutathione ( g@@ ss@@ g ) increased significantly following 30 and 60 min of reper@@ fu@@ sion@@ . there was no increase in any of the products of lipid peroxidation associated with this injur@@ y@@ . an increase in g@@ ss@@ g within hepatic tissue during intestinal reperfusion suggests exposure of hepatocytes to an oxidant stress@@ . the lack of a significant increase in products of lipid peroxidation suggests that the oxidant stress is of insufficient magnitude to result in irreversible injury to hepatocyte cell membran@@ es@@ . these data also suggest that the measurement of tissue g@@ ss@@ g may be a more sensitive indicator of oxidant stress than measurement of products of lipid peroxidation .
di@@ phen@@ hydr@@ amine prevents the haemodynamic changes of cimetidine in ic@@ u patient@@ s. cimetidine , a histamine 2 ( h@@ 2 ) antagonist , produces a decrease in arterial pressure due to vasodilatation , especially in critically ill patient@@ s. this may be because cimetidine acts as a histamine agon@@ ist@@ . we , therefore , investigated the effects of the histamine 1 ( h1 ) receptor antagonist , di@@ phen@@ hydr@@ amine , on the haemodynamic changes observed after cimetidine in ic@@ u patient@@ s. each patient was studied on two separate day@@ s. in a random fashion , they received cimetidine 200 mg iv on one day , and on the other , a pretreatment of di@@ phen@@ hydr@@ amine 40 mg iv with cimetidine 200 mg iv@@ . in the non @-@ pretreatment group , mean arterial pressure ( map ) decreased from 10@@ 7.4 + / - 8.4 mm@@ h@@ g to 86.7 + / - 11.4 mm@@ h@@ g ( p less than 0.01 ) two minutes after cim@@ eti@@ d@@ ine@@ . also , systemic vascular resistance ( s@@ v@@ r ) decreased during the eight @-@ minute observation period ( p less than 0.01 ) . in contrast , in the pretreatment group , little haemodynamic change was se@@ en@@ . we conclude that an h1 antagonist may be useful in preventing hypotension caused by iv cimetidine , since the vasodil@@ ating activity of cimetidine is mediated , in part , through the h1 receptor .

effects of cro@@ ma@@ kal@@ im and pin@@ acidi@@ l on large epicardial and small coronary arteries in conscious dog@@ s. the effects of i.v. bolus administration of cro@@ ma@@ kal@@ im ( 1 @-@ 10 micrograms / kg ) and pin@@ acidi@@ l ( 3 @-@ 100 micrograms / kg ) on large ( circumflex artery ) and small coronary arteries and on systemic hemodynamics were investigated in chronically instrumented conscious dogs and compared to those of nitroglycerin ( 0.03 @-@ 10 micrograms / kg ) . nitroglycerin , up to 0.3 micrograms / kg , selectively increased circumflex artery diameter ( c@@ x@@ ad ) without simultaneously affecting any other cardiac or systemic hemodynamic parameter@@ . in contrast , cro@@ ma@@ kal@@ im and pin@@ acidi@@ l at all doses and nitroglycerin at doses higher than 0.3 micrograms / kg simultaneously and dose @-@ dependently increased c@@ x@@ ad , coronary blood flow and heart rate and decreased coronary vascular resistance and aortic pres@@ su@@ re@@ . cro@@ ma@@ kal@@ im was approximately 8- to 9.5 @-@ fold more potent than pin@@ acidi@@ l in increasing c@@ x@@ ad@@ . vasodilation of large and small coronary vessels and hypotension induced by cro@@ ma@@ kal@@ im and pin@@ acidi@@ l were not affected by prior combined beta adrenergic and muscarinic receptors blockade but drug @-@ induced tachycardia was abol@@ is@@ he@@ d. when circumflex artery blood flow was maintained constant , the increases in c@@ x@@ ad induced by cro@@ ma@@ kal@@ im ( 10 micrograms / kg ) , pin@@ acidi@@ l ( 30 micrograms / kg ) and nitroglycerin ( 10 micrograms / kg ) were reduced by 68 + / - 7 , 54 + / - 9 and 1 + / - 1 % , respec@@ ti@@ vel@@ y@@ . thus , whereas nitroglycerin preferentially and flow @-@ independently dil@@ ates large coronary arteries , cro@@ ma@@ kal@@ im and pin@@ acidi@@ l di@@ late both large and small coronary arteries and this effect is not dependent upon the simultaneous beta adrenoceptors @-@ mediated rise in myocardial metabolic deman@@ d. finally , two mechanisms at least , direct vasodilation and flow dependency , are involved in the cro@@ ma@@ kal@@ im@@ - and pin@@ acidi@@ l @-@ induced increase in c@@ x@@ ad .

the long @-@ term safety of dan@@ azol in women with hereditary angio@@ ede@@ ma@@ . although the short @-@ term safety ( less than or equal to 6 months ) of dan@@ azol has been established in a variety of settings , no information exists as to its long @-@ term saf@@ et@@ y@@ . we therefore investigated the long @-@ term safety of dan@@ azol by performing a retrospective chart review of 60 female patients with hereditary angioedema treated with dan@@ azol for a continuous period of 6 months or long@@ er@@ . the mean age of the patients was 35.2 years and the mean duration of therapy was 5@@ 9.7 mon@@ th@@ s. virtually all patients experienced one or more adverse re@@ action@@ s. menstrual abnormalities ( 79 % ) , weight gain ( 60 % ) , muscle cr@@ amps / my@@ al@@ gi@@ as ( 40 % ) , and transaminase elevations ( 40 % ) were the most common adverse re@@ action@@ s. the drug was discontinued due to adverse reactions in 8 patient@@ s. no patient has died or suffered any apparent long @-@ term sequelae that were directly attributable to the dru@@ g. we conclude that , despite a relatively high incidence of adverse reactions , dan@@ azol has proven to be remarkably safe over the long @-@ term in this group of patients .
patient tolerance study of topical chlorhexidine di@@ phosph@@ anil@@ ate : a new topical agent for bur@@ n@@ s. effective topical antimicrobial agents decrease infection and mortality in burn patient@@ s. chlorhexidine phosph@@ anil@@ ate ( ch@@ p ) , a new broad @-@ spectrum antimicrobial agent , has been evaluated as a topical burn wound dressing in cream form , but preliminary clinical trials reported that it was painful upon applic@@ ation@@ . this study compared various concentrations of ch@@ p to determine if a tolerable concentration could be identified with retention of antimicrobial efficac@@ y@@ . twenty @-@ nine burn patients , each with two similar burns which could be separately treated , were given pairs of treatments at successive 12 @-@ h intervals over a 3 @-@ day period@@ . one burn site was treated with each of four different ch@@ p concentrations , from 0.25 per cent to 2 per cent , their vehicle , and 1 per cent silver sulph@@ adi@@ azine ( ag@@ sd ) cream , an antimicrobial agent frequently used for topical treatment of burn w@@ ound@@ s. the other site was always treated with ag@@ sd cre@@ am@@ . there was a direct relationship between ch@@ p concentration and patients &apos; ratings of pain on an analogue scal@@ e. the 0.25 per cent ch@@ p cream was closest to ag@@ sd in pain tolerance ; however , none of the treatments differed statistically from ag@@ sd or from each other@@ . in addition , ease of application of ch@@ p cre@@ ams was less satisfactory than that of ag@@ s@@ d. it was concluded that formulations at or below 0.5 per cent ch@@ p may prove acceptable for wound care , but the vehicle system needs pharmaceutical improvement to render it more tolerable and easier to use .
dose @-@ dependent neurotoxicity of high @-@ dose bus@@ ulfan in children : a clinical and pharmacological stud@@ y@@ . bus@@ ulfan is known to be neurotoxic in animals and humans , but its acute neurotoxicity remains poorly characterized in child@@ ren@@ . we report here a retrospective study of 123 children ( median age , 6.5 years ) receiving high @-@ dose bus@@ ulfan in combined chemotherapy before bone marrow transplantation for malignant solid tumors , brain tumors exclu@@ de@@ d. bus@@ ulfan was given p.o. , every 6 hours for 16 doses over 4 day@@ s. two total doses were consecutively used : 16 mg / kg , then 600 mg / m@@ 2. the dose calculation on the basis of body surface area results in higher doses in young children than in older patients ( 16 to 28 mg / kg ) . ninety @-@ six patients were not given anti@@ convulsive prophylaxis ; 7 ( 7.5 % ) developed seizures during the 4 days of the bus@@ ulfan course or within 24 h after the last dos@@ ing@@ . when the total bus@@ ulfan dose was taken into account , there was a significant difference in terms of neurotoxicity incidence among patients under 16 mg / kg ( 1 of 57 , 1.7 % ) and patients under 600 mg / m2 ( 6 of 39 , 15.4 % ) ( p less than 0.02 ) . twenty @-@ seven patients were given a 600 @-@ mg / m2 bus@@ ulfan total dose with continuous i.v. infusion of clon@@ azepam ; none had any neurological symptom@@ s. bus@@ ulfan levels were measured by a gas chromatographic @-@ mass spectrometry assay in the plasma and cerebrospinal fluid of 9 children without central nervous system disease under 600 mg / m2 bus@@ ulfan with clon@@ azepam : bus@@ ulfan cerebrospinal fluid : plasma ratio was 1.@@ 39@@ . this was significantly different ( p less than 0.02 ) from the cerebrospinal fluid : plasma ratio previously defined in children receiving a 16 @-@ mg / kg total dose of bus@@ ulf@@ an@@ . this study shows that bus@@ ulfan neurotoxicity is dose @-@ dependent in children and efficiently prevented by clon@@ azep@@ am@@ . a bus@@ ulfan dose calculated on the basis of body surface area , resulting in higher doses in young children , was followed by increased neurotoxicity , close to neurotoxicity incidence observed in adul@@ ts@@ . since plasma pharmacokinetic studies showed a faster bus@@ ulfan clearance in children than in adults , this new dose may approximate more closely the adult systemic exposure obtained after the usual 16 @-@ mg / kg total dose , with potential inferences in terms of anticancer or myeloablative effec@@ ts@@ . the bus@@ ulfan dose in children and infants undergoing bone marrow transplantation should be re@@ considered on the basis of pharmacokinetic studies .
histamine antagonists and d @-@ tub@@ oc@@ ur@@ arine @-@ induced hypotension in cardiac surgical patient@@ s. hemodynamic effects and histamine release by bolus injection of 0.35 mg / kg of d @-@ tub@@ oc@@ ur@@ arine were studied in 24 patient@@ s. h@@ 1- and h@@ 2 @-@ histamine antagonists or placebo were given before dosing with d @-@ tub@@ oc@@ ur@@ arine in a randomized double @-@ blind fashion to four groups : group 1--@@ placebo ; group 2@@ --@@ cimetidine , 4 mg / kg , plus placebo ; group 3@@ --@@ chlor@@ phen@@ ir@@ amine , 0.1 mg / kg , plus placebo ; and group 4@@ --@@ cimetidine plus chlor@@ phen@@ ir@@ amin@@ e. histamine release occurred in most patients , the highest level 2 minutes after d @-@ tub@@ oc@@ ur@@ arine dos@@ ing@@ . group 1 had a moderate negative correlation between plasma histamine change and systemic vascular resistance ( r = 0.58 ; p less than 0.05 ) not present in group 4@@ . prior dosing with antagonists partially prevented the fall in systemic vascular resist@@ anc@@ e. these data demonstrate that the hemodynamic changes associated with d @-@ tub@@ oc@@ ur@@ arine dosing are only partially explained by histamine releas@@ e. thus prior dosing with h@@ 1- and h@@ 2 @-@ antagonists provides only partial protection .
convulsant effect of lin@@ dane and regional brain concentration of gab@@ a and dop@@ amin@@ e. lin@@ dane ( gamma @-@ hexachloro@@ cyclohexane ) is an organochlorine insecticide with known neurotoxic effec@@ ts@@ . its mechanism of action is not well understood although it has been proposed that lin@@ dane acts as a non @-@ competitive antagonist at the gamma @-@ aminobutyric acid ( gab@@ a ) -@@ a recep@@ tor@@ . we studied the effect of lin@@ dane ( 150 mg / kg ) on the gab@@ a@@ ergic and dopaminergic systems by measuring the concentration of gab@@ a , dopamine and its metabolites in 7 brain areas at the onset of seiz@@ u@@ res@@ . all animals suffered tonic convulsions at 18.3 + / - 1.4 min after lin@@ dane administr@@ ation@@ . the concentration of gab@@ a was only slightly but significantly decreased in the coll@@ iculi without modifications in the other are@@ as@@ . the concentration of dopamine was increased in the mes@@ encephalon and that of its metabolite dop@@ ac was also increased in the mes@@ encephalon and the striatum .

anticonvulsant actions of m@@ k @-@ 801 on the lithium @-@ pilocarpine model of status epilepticus in rat@@ s. m@@ k @-@ 801 , a noncompetitive n @-@ methyl @-@ d @-@ aspartate ( nm@@ da ) receptor antagonist , was tested for anticonvulsant effects in rats using two seizure models , coadministration of lithium and pilocarpine and administration of a high dose of pilocarpine al@@ on@@ e. three major results are repor@@ te@@ d. first , pretreatment with m@@ k @-@ 801 produced an effective and dose @-@ dependent anticonvulsant action with the lithium @-@ pilocarpine model but not with rats treated with pilocarpine alone , suggesting that different biochemical mechanisms control seizures in these two mod@@ el@@ s. second , the anticonvulsant effect of m@@ k @-@ 801 in the lithium @-@ pilocarpine model only occurred after initial periods of seizure activ@@ it@@ y@@ . this observation is suggested to be an in vivo demonstration of the conclusion derived from in vitro experiments that m@@ k @-@ 801 binding requires agonist @-@ induced opening of the channel sites of the nm@@ da recep@@ tor@@ . third , although it is relatively easy to block seizures induced by lithium and pilocarpine by administration of anticonvulsants prior to pilocarpine , it is more difficult to terminate ongoing status epilepticus and block the lethality of the seiz@@ u@@ res@@ . administration of m@@ k @-@ 801 30 or 60 min after pilocarpine , i.e. , during status epilepticus , gradually reduced electrical and behavioral seizure activity and greatly enhanced the survival rat@@ e. these results suggest that activation of nm@@ da receptors plays an important role in status epilepticus and brain damage in the lithium @-@ pilocarpine mod@@ el@@ . this was further supported by results showing that non@@ convulsive doses of nm@@ da and pilocarpine were synergistic , resulting in status epilepticus and subsequent mortality .
nifedipine induced bradycardia in a patient with autonomic neuro@@ path@@ y@@ . an 80 year old diabetic male with evidence of peripheral and autonomic neuropathy was admitted with chest pain@@ . he was found to have atrial flutter at a ventricular rate of 70 / min which slowed down to 30 @-@ 40 / min when nifedipine ( 60 mg ) in 3 divided doses , during which he was paced at a rate of 70 / min@@ . this is inconsistent with the well @-@ established finding that nifedipine induces tachycardia in normally innervated heart@@ s. however , in hearts deprived of compensatory sympathetic drive , it may lead to bradycardia .
the effect of haloperidol in cocaine and amphetamine intox@@ ic@@ ation@@ . the effectiveness of haloperidol pretreatment in preventing the toxic effects of high doses of amphetamine and cocaine was studied in rat@@ s. in this model , toxic effects were induced by intraperitoneal ( i.p. ) injection of amphetamine 75 mg / kg ( 100 % death rate ) or cocaine 70 mg / kg ( 82 % death rate ) . haloperidol failed to prevent amphetamine @-@ induced seizures , but did lower the mortality rate at most doses te@@ ste@@ d. haloperidol decreased the incidence of cocaine @-@ induced seizures at the two highest doses , but the lowering of the mortality rate did not reach statistical significance at any dos@@ e. these data suggest a protective role for the central dopamine blocker haloperidol against death from high @-@ dose amphetamine exposure without reducing the incidence of seiz@@ u@@ res@@ . in contrast , haloperidol demonstrated an ability to reduce cocaine @-@ induced seizures without significantly reducing mortality .

support for adrenaline @-@ hypertension hypothesis : 18 hour pressor effect after 6 hours adrenaline infu@@ sion@@ . in a double blind , crossover study 6 h infusions of adrenaline ( 15 ng / kg / min ; 1 ng = 5.@@ 4@@ 58 pmol ) , noradrenaline ( 30 ng / kg / min ; 1 ng = 5.@@ 9@@ 11 pmol ) , and a 5 % dextrose solution ( 5.4 ml / h ) , were given to ten healthy volunteers in random order 2 weeks ap@@ art@@ . by means of intra @-@ arterial ambulatory monitoring the haemodynamic effects were followed for 18 h after the infusions were stop@@ ped@@ . adrenaline , but not noradrenaline , caused a delayed and protracted pressor effec@@ t. over the total postin@@ fusion period systolic and diastolic arterial pressure were 6 ( se@@ m 2 ) % and 7 ( 2 ) % , respectively , higher than after dextrose infusion ( an@@ ova , p less than 0.001 ) . thus , &quot; stress &quot; levels of adrenaline ( 230 pg / ml ) for 6 h cause a delayed and protracted pressor effec@@ t. these findings are strong support for the adrenaline @-@ hypertension hypothesis in man .
effect of alkyl@@ xanth@@ ines on gentamicin @-@ induced acute renal failure in the rat@@ . adenosine antagonists have been previously shown to be of benefit in some ischaemic and nephrotoxic models of acute renal failure ( ar@@ f ) . in the present study , the effects of three alkyl@@ xanth@@ ines with different potencies as adenosine antagonists 8 @-@ phenyl@@ theophylline , theophylline and en@@ prof@@ ylline , were examined in rats developing acute renal failure after 4 daily injections of gentamicin ( 200 mg kg @-@ 1 ) . renal function was assessed by biochemical ( plasma urea and creatinine ) , functional ( urine analysis and &#91; 3@@ h &#93; inulin and &#91; 14@@ c &#93; p @-@ amino@@ hippur@@ ic acid clearances ) and morphological ( degree of necrosis ) indic@@ es@@ . the various drug treatments produced improvements in some , but not all , measurements of renal function@@ . however , any improvement produced by drug treatment was largely a result of a beneficial effect exerted by its vehicle ( polyethylene glycol and na@@ o@@ h ) . the lack of any consistent protective effect noted with the alkyl@@ xanth@@ ines tested in the present study indicates that adenosine plays little , if any , pathophysiological role in gentamicin @-@ induced ar@@ f .
adverse ocular reactions possibly associated with isot@@ retin@@ oin@@ . a total of 261 adverse ocular reactions occurred in 237 patients who received isot@@ retinoin , a commonly used drug in the treatment of severe cystic ac@@ ne@@ . blepharo@@ conjunctivitis , subjective complaints of dry eyes , blur@@ red vision , contact lens intolerance , and photo@@ dermatitis are reversible side effec@@ ts@@ . more serious ocular adverse reactions include pap@@ il@@ le@@ dema , pseudotumor cerebr@@ i , and white or gray subepithelial corneal opacities ; all of these are reversible if the drug is discontinu@@ ed@@ . reported cases of decreased dark adaptation are under investig@@ ation@@ . isot@@ retinoin is contraindicated in pregnancy because of the many reported congenital abnormalities after maternal use ( including micro@@ phthal@@ mos , orbital hyper@@ tel@@ or@@ ism , and optic nerve hypoplasia ) .
proc@@ ater@@ ol and terbutaline in bronchial asth@@ ma@@ . a double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled , cross @-@ over stud@@ y@@ . proc@@ ater@@ ol , a new beta @-@ 2 adrenoceptor stimulant , was studied in a double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled , cross @-@ over trial in patients with bronchial asth@@ ma@@ . oral proc@@ ater@@ ol 50 micrograms b.@@ d. , proc@@ ater@@ ol 100 micrograms b.@@ d. , and terbutaline 5 mg t.@@ i.d. , were compared when given randomly in 1 @-@ week treatment period@@ s. the best clinical effect was found with ter@@ but@@ al@@ ine@@ . both anti @-@ asthmatic and tre@@ mor@@ genic effects of proc@@ ater@@ ol were dose @-@ rel@@ ated@@ . proc@@ ater@@ ol appeared effective in the doses tested , and a twice daily regimen would appear to be suitable with this drug .
subacute effects of propranolol and b 24 / 76 on isoproterenol @-@ induced rat heart hypertrophy in correlation with blood pres@@ su@@ re@@ . we compared the potential beta @-@ receptor blocker , b 24 / 76 i.e. 1- ( 2,4 @-@ dichloro@@ phenoxy ) -3 &#91; 2 @-@ 3,4 @-@ di@@ methoxyphenyl ) ethan@@ ol@@ amino &#93; -@@ pro@@ p an @-@ 2 @-@ ol , which is characterized by beta 1 @-@ adrenoceptor blocking and beta 2 @-@ adrenoceptor stimulating properties with pro@@ pran@@ ol@@ ol@@ . the studies were performed using an experimental model of isoproterenol @-@ induced heart hypertrophy in rat@@ s. a correlation of the blood pressure was neither found in the development nor in the attempt to suppress the development of heart hypertrophy with the two beta @-@ receptor bloc@@ ker@@ s. both beta @-@ blockers influenced the development of hypertrophy to a different , but not reproducible ex@@ tent@@ . it was possible to suppress the increased ornithine decarboxylase activity with both beta @-@ blockers in hypertrophied hearts , but there was no effect on the heart mass@@ . neither propranolol nor b 24 / 76 could stop the changes in the characteristic myosin isoenzyme pattern of the hypertrophied rat heart@@ . thus , the investigations did not provide any evidence that the beta @-@ receptor blockers propranolol and b 24 / 76 have the potency to prevent isoproterenol from producing heart hypertrophy .
comparison of the effect of ox@@ it@@ rop@@ ium bromide and of slow @-@ release theophylline on nocturnal asth@@ ma@@ . the effects of a new inhaled antim@@ us@@ carinic drug , ox@@ it@@ rop@@ ium bromide , and of a slow @-@ release theophylline preparation upon nocturnal asthma were compared in a placebo @-@ controlled double @-@ blind stud@@ y@@ . two samples were studied : 12 patients received ox@@ it@@ rop@@ ium at 600 micrograms ( 6 subjects ) or at 400 micrograms t.@@ i.d. ( 6 subjects ) whereas 11 received theophylline at 300 mg b.i.d. morning dip@@ ping , assessed by the fall in peak flow overnight , was significantly reduced in the periods when either active drug was taken , whereas no difference was noticed during the placebo administr@@ ation@@ . no significant difference was noticed between results obtained with either active drug , as well as with either dosage of ox@@ it@@ rop@@ i@@ um@@ . no subject reported side effects of ox@@ it@@ rop@@ ium , as compared to three subjects reporting nausea , vomiting and tre@@ mor@@ s after the@@ ophyl@@ lin@@ e. ox@@ it@@ rop@@ ium proves to be a valuable alternative to theophylline in nocturnal asthma , since it is equally potent , safer and does not require the titration of dosage .

reversible valproic acid @-@ induced dementia : a case repor@@ t. reversible valproic acid @-@ induced dementia was documented in a 21 @-@ year @-@ old man with epilepsy who had a 3 @-@ year history of insi@@ dious progressive decline in global cognitive abilities documented by serial neuropsychological studi@@ es@@ . repeat neuropsychological testing 7 weeks after discontinuation of the drug revealed dramatic improvement in i@@ q , memory , naming , and other tasks comm@@ ensur@@ ate with clinical recovery in his intellectual capac@@ it@@ y@@ . possible pathophysiological mechanisms which may have been operative in this case include : a direct central nervous system ( c@@ ns ) toxic effect of valproic acid ; a paradoxical epileptogenic effect secondary to the drug ; and an indirect c@@ ns toxic effect mediated through valproic acid @-@ induced hyper@@ ammon@@ emia .
reversal of scopolamine @-@ induced amnesia of passive avoidance by pre- and post @-@ training nal@@ ox@@ on@@ e. in a series of five experiments , the modulating role of naloxone on a scopolamine @-@ induced retention deficit in a passive avoidance paradigm was investigated in mic@@ e. scopolamine , but not methyl scopolamine ( 1 and 3 mg / kg ) , induced an amnesia as measured by latency and duration parameter@@ s. naloxone ( 0.3 , 1 , 3 , and 10 mg / kg ) injected prior to training attenuated the retention deficit with a peak of activity at 3 mg / k@@ g. the effect of naloxone could be antagonized with morphine ( 1 , 3 , and 10 mg / kg ) , demonstrating the opioid specificity of the naloxone effec@@ t. post @-@ training administration of naloxone ( 3 mg / kg ) as a single or as a split dose also attenuated the scopolamine @-@ induced amne@@ si@@ a. control experiments indicated that neither an increase in pain sensitivity ( pre @-@ training naloxone ) nor an induced aversive state ( post @-@ training naloxone ) appear to be responsible for the influence of naloxone on the scopolamine @-@ induced retention defic@@ it@@ . these results extend previous findings implicating a cholinergic @-@ opioid interaction in memory process@@ es@@ . a possible mechanism for this interaction involving the sep@@ to @-@ hippocampal cholinergic pathway is discussed .
electron microscopic investigations of the cyclophosphamide @-@ induced lesions of the urinary bladder of the rat and their prevention by mes@@ na@@ . fully developed cyclophosphamide @-@ induced cystitis is characterized by nearly complete detachment of the uroth@@ elium , severe submucosal edema owing to damage to the microvascular bed and focal muscle nec@@ ros@@ es@@ . the initial response to the primary attack by the cyclophosphamide metabolites seems to be fragmentation of the luminal membran@@ e. this damages the cellular barrier against the hypertonic ur@@ ine@@ . subsequent breaks in the lateral cell membranes of the superficial cells and in all the plasma membranes of the intermediate and basal cells , intercellular and intracellular edema and disintegration of the desm@@ osomes and hem@@ id@@ es@@ m@@ osomes lead to progressive degeneration and detachment of the epithelial cells with exposure and splitting of the basal membran@@ e. the morphological changes of the endothelial cells , which become more pronounced in the later stages of the experiment , the involvement of blood vessels regardless of their diameter and the location @-@ dependent extent of the damage indicate a direct type of damage which is preceded by a mediator @-@ induced increase in permeability , the morphological correlate of which is the formation of gaps in the inte@@ ren@@ do@@ thelial cell connections on the ven@@ ul@@ es@@ . these changes can be effectively prevented by mes@@ na@@ . the only sign of a possible involvement is the increase in the number of specific granules with a presumed lysosomal function in the superficial cells .
increase in intragastric pressure during su@@ x@@ am@@ ethonium @-@ induced muscle fascicul@@ ations in children : inhibition by al@@ fentan@@ il@@ . changes in intragastric pressure after the administration of su@@ x@@ am@@ ethonium 1.5 mg kg @-@ 1 i.v. were studied in 32 children ( mean age 6.9 yr ) pretreated with either physiological saline or alfentanil 50 micrograms kg @-@ 1@@ . anaesthesia was induced with thi@@ opent@@ one 5 mg kg @-@ 1@@ . the incidence and intensity of muscle fascicul@@ ations caused by su@@ x@@ am@@ ethonium were significantly greater in the control than in the alfentanil grou@@ p. the intragastric pressure during muscle fascicul@@ ations was significantly higher in the control group ( 16 + / - 0.7 ( se@@ m ) cm h@@ 2@@ o ) than in the alfentanil group ( 7.7 + / - 1.5 ( se@@ m ) cm h@@ 2@@ o ) . the increase in intragastric pressure was directly related to the intensity of muscle fascicul@@ ations ( regression line : y = 0.5 + 4.@@ 78@@ x with r of 0.78 ) . it is concluded that intragastric pressure increases significantly during muscle fascicul@@ ations caused by su@@ x@@ am@@ ethonium in healthy child@@ ren@@ . alfentanil 50 micrograms kg @-@ 1 effectively inhibits the incidence and intensity of su@@ x@@ am@@ ethonium @-@ induced muscle fascicul@@ ations ; moreover , intragastric pressure remains at its control value .
acute insulin treatment normal@@ izes the resistance to the cardi@@ otoxic effect of isoproterenol in streptozotocin diabetic rat@@ s. a morphometric study of isoproterenol induced myocardial fibro@@ si@@ s. the acute effect of insulin treatment on the earlier reported protective effect of streptozotocin diabetes against the cardi@@ otoxic effect of high doses of isoproterenol ( iso ) was investigated in rat@@ s. thirty to 135 min after the injection of crystalline insulin , iso was given subcutaneously and when iso induced fibrosis in the myocardium was morph@@ ometrically analyzed 7 days later , a highly significant correlation ( r = 0.83 , 2 p = 0.006 ) to the slope of the fall in blood glucose after insulin treatment appe@@ are@@ d. the myocardial content of catecholamines was estimated in these 8 day diabetic rat@@ s. the norepinephrine content was significantly increased while epinephrine remained un@@ chang@@ ed@@ . an enhanced sympathetic nervous system activity with a consequent down regulation of the myocardial beta @-@ adrenergic receptors could , therefore , explain this catecholamine resist@@ anc@@ e. the rapid reversion after insulin treatment exclud@@ es the possibility that streptozotocin in itself causes the iso resistance and points towards a direct insulin effect on myocardial catecholamine sensitivity in diabetic rat@@ s. the phenomenon described might elucidate pathogenetic mechanisms behind toxic myocardial cell degeneration and may possibly have relevance for acute cardiovascular complications in diabetic patients .
differential effects of non @-@ steroidal anti @-@ inflammatory drugs on seizures produced by pilocarpine in rat@@ s. the muscarinic cholinergic agonist pilocarpine induces in rats seizures and status epilepticus followed by widespread damage to the fore@@ bra@@ in@@ . the present study was designed to investigate the effect of 5 non @-@ steroidal anti @-@ inflammatory drugs , sodium salicylate , phenyl@@ but@@ azone , indomethacin , ibuprofen and me@@ fen@@ amic acid , on seizures produced by pil@@ ocar@@ pine@@ . pretreatment of rats with sodium salicylate , ed@@ 50 103 mg / kg ( 60 @-@ 174 ) , and phenyl@@ but@@ azone , 59 mg / kg ( 50 @-@ 70 ) converted the non @-@ convulsant dose of pilocarpine , 200 mg / kg , to a convulsant on@@ e. indomethacin , 1 @-@ 10 mg / kg , and ibuprofen , 10 @-@ 100 mg / kg , failed to modulate seizures produced by pil@@ ocar@@ pine@@ . me@@ fen@@ amic acid , 26 ( 22 @-@ 30 ) mg / kg , prevented seizures and protected rats from seizure @-@ related brain damage induced by pilocarpine , 380 mg / k@@ g. these results indicate that non @-@ steroidal anti @-@ inflammatory drugs differentially modulate the threshold for pilocarpine @-@ induced seizures .
acute neurologic dysfunction after high @-@ dose etoposide therapy for malignant gli@@ om@@ a. etoposide ( v@@ p @-@ 16 @-@ 213 ) has been used in the treatment of many solid tumors and hematologic malign@@ anc@@ i@@ es@@ . when used in high doses and in conjunction with autologous bone marrow transplantation , this agent has activity against several treatment @-@ resistant cancers including malignant gli@@ om@@ a. in six of eight patients ( 75 % ) who we treated for recurrent or resistant glioma , sudden severe neurologic deterioration occur@@ red@@ . this developed a median of 9 days after initiation of high @-@ dose etoposide therap@@ y@@ . significant clinical manifestations have included confusion , pap@@ il@@ le@@ dema , somn@@ olence , exacerbation of motor deficits , and sharp increase in seizure activ@@ it@@ y@@ . these abnormalities resolved rapidly after initiation of high @-@ dose intravenous dexamethasone therap@@ y@@ . in all patients , computerized tomographic ( ct ) brain scans demonstrated stability in tumor size and perit@@ umor edema when compared with pretransplant sc@@ an@@ s. this complication appears to represent a significant new toxicity of high @-@ dose etoposide therapy for malignant glioma .
progressive bile duct injury after thi@@ ab@@ endazole administr@@ ation@@ . a 27 @-@ yr @-@ old man developed jaundice 2 wk after exposure to thi@@ ab@@ end@@ azol@@ e. cholestasis persisted for 3 yr , at which time a liver transplant was perfor@@ med@@ . two liver biopsy specimens and the hepatectomy specimen were remarkable for almost complete disappearance of inter@@ lobular bile duc@@ ts@@ . prominent fibrosis and hepatocellular regeneration were also present ; however , the lobular architecture was preser@@ ve@@ d. this case represents an example of &quot; idi@@ osyn@@ cr@@ atic &quot; drug @-@ induced liver damage in which the primary target of injury is the bile duc@@ t. an autoimmune pathogenesis of the bile duct destruction is suggested .
differential effects of 1,4 @-@ dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers : therapeutic implic@@ ation@@ s. increasing recognition of the importance of calcium in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease has stimulated research into the use of calcium channel blocking agents for treatment of a variety of cardiovascular dise@@ as@@ es@@ . the favorable efficacy and tolerability profiles of these agents make them attractive therapeutic mod@@ al@@ iti@@ es@@ . clinical applications of calcium channel blockers parallel their tissue selec@@ tiv@@ it@@ y@@ . in contrast to verapamil and diltiazem , which are roughly equipot@@ ent in their actions on the heart and vascular smooth muscle , the dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are a group of potent peripheral vasodilator agents that exert minimal electrophysiologic effects on cardiac nodal or conduction tissu@@ e. as the first dihydropyridine available for use in the un@@ ited states , nifedipine controls angina and hypertension with minimal depression of cardiac function@@ . additional members of this group of calcium channel blockers have been studied for a variety of indications for which they may offer advantages over current therap@@ y@@ . once or twice daily dosage possible with nit@@ rendipine and n@@ isol@@ dipine offers a convenient administration schedule , which encourages patient compliance in long @-@ term therapy of hyper@@ ten@@ sion@@ . the coronary vasodil@@ ating properties of n@@ isol@@ dipine have led to the investigation of this agent for use in ang@@ in@@ a. selectivity for the cerebrovascular bed makes nimodipine potentially useful in the treatment of subarachnoid hemorrhage , migraine headache , dementia , and stro@@ ke@@ . in general , the dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are usually well tolerated , with headache , facial flushing , palp@@ itations , edema , nausea , anorexia , and dizziness being the more common adverse effects .
the enhancement of amin@@ onucle@@ oside neph@@ rosis by the co @-@ administration of prot@@ amin@@ e. an experimental model of focal segmental glomerular sclerosis ( f@@ s@@ gs ) was developed in rats by the combined administration of puromycin @-@ amin@@ onucle@@ oside ( am@@ ns ) and protamine sulfate ( ps ) . male sp@@ rag@@ ue @-@ d@@ aw@@ ley rats , un@@ in@@ eph@@ rectomized three weeks before , received daily injections of subcutaneous am@@ ns ( 1 mg / 100 g body wt ) and intravenous ps ( 2 separated doses of 2.5 mg / 100 g body wt ) for four day@@ s. the series of injections were repeated another three times at 10 day inter@@ val@@ s. the animals were sacrificed on days 24 , 52 , and 80@@ . they developed nephrotic syndrome and finally renal fail@@ ure@@ . the time @-@ course curve of creatinine clearance dropped and showed significant difference ( p less than 0.01 ) from that of each control group , such as , am@@ ns alone , ps alone or saline injec@@ te@@ d. their glomeruli showed changes of progressive f@@ sg@@ s. the ultrastructural studies in the initial stage revealed significant lack of particles of perfused ruthenium red on the lamina r@@ ara extern@@ a and marked changes in epithelial cell cyto@@ plasm@@ . therefore , it is suggested that the administration of ps enhances the toxicity of am@@ ns on the glomerul@@ us and readily produces progressive f@@ s@@ gs in rats resulting in the end @-@ stage renal disease .
theophylline neurotoxicity in pregnant rat@@ s. the purpose of this investigation was to determine whether the neurotoxicity of theophylline is altered in advanced pregn@@ anc@@ y@@ . sp@@ rag@@ ue @-@ d@@ aw@@ ley rats that were 20 days pregnant and nonpregnant rats of the same age and strain received infusions of amin@@ ophylline until onset of maximal seizures which occurred after 28 and 30 minutes respec@@ ti@@ vel@@ y@@ . theophylline concentrations at this endpoint in serum ( total ) and cs@@ f were similar but serum ( free ) and brain concentrations were slightly different in pregnant rat@@ s. theophylline serum protein binding determined by equilibrium dialysis was lower in pregnant rat@@ s. fetal serum concentrations at onset of seizures in the mother were similar to maternal brain and cs@@ f concentrations and correlated significantly with the form@@ er@@ . it is concluded that advanced pregnancy has a negligible effect on the neurotoxic response to theophylline in rats .
hyperkalemia induced by indomethacin and naproxen and reversed by flud@@ ro@@ cortis@@ on@@ e. we have described a patient with severe rheumatoid arthritis and a history of me@@ fen@@ amic acid nephropathy in whom hyperkalemia and inappropriate hypo@@ aldosteronism were caused by both indomethacin and naproxen , without major decline in renal function@@ . it is likely that preexisting renal disease predisposed this patient to type iv renal tubular acidosis with prostaglandin synthetase inhibit@@ or@@ s. because he was unable to dis@@ continue nonsteroidal anti @-@ inflammatory drug therapy , flud@@ ro@@ cortisone was added , correcting the hyperkalemia and allowing indomethacin therapy to be continued safely .
hypotension as a manifestation of cardiotoxicity in three patients receiving cisplatin and 5 @-@ fluoro@@ ur@@ ac@@ il@@ . cardiac symptoms , including hypotension , developed in three patients with advanced colorectal carcinoma while being treated with cisplatin ( cd@@ d@@ p ) and 5 @-@ fluorouracil ( 5 @-@ f@@ u ) . in two patients , hypotension was associated with severe left ventricular dys@@ function@@ . all three patients required therapy discontinu@@ ation@@ . cardiac enzymes remained normal despite transient electrocardiographic ( e@@ kg ) chang@@ es@@ . the presentation and cardiac evaluation ( hemodynamic , echocardiographic , and scintigraphic ) of these patients suggest new manifestations of 5 @-@ f@@ u cardiotoxicity that may be influenced by cd@@ d@@ p. the possible pathophysiologic mechanisms are discussed .
fatal aplastic anemia in a patient treated with carbam@@ azep@@ ine@@ . a case of fatal aplastic anemia due to carbamazepine treatment in an epileptic woman is repor@@ te@@ d. despite concerns of fatal bone marrow toxicity due to carbamazepine , this is only the fourth documented and published repor@@ t. carbamazepine is a safe drug , but physicians and patients should be aware of the exceedingly rare but potentially fatal side effects , better prevented by clinical than by laboratory monitoring .
participation of a bul@@ b@@ ospinal serotonergic pathway in the rat brain in clonidine @-@ induced hypotension and brady@@ cardi@@ a. the effects of microinjection of clonidine ( 1 @-@ 10 micrograms in 1 microliter ) into a region adjacent to the ventrolateral surface of the medulla oblong@@ ata on cardiovascular function were assessed in urethane @-@ anesthetized rat@@ s. intramedullary administration of clonidine , but not saline vehicle , caused a dose @-@ dependent decrease in both the mean arterial pressure and the heart rat@@ e. the clonidine @-@ induced hypotension was antagonized by prior spinal transection , but not bilateral vag@@ ot@@ omy@@ . on the other hand , the clonidine @-@ induced bradycardia was antagonized by prior bilateral vagotomy , but not spinal trans@@ ec@@ tion@@ . furthermore , selective destruction of the spinal 5 @-@ h@@ t nerves , produced by bilateral spinal injection of 5,7 @-@ dihydroxy@@ tryptamine , reduced the magnitude of the vaso@@ depressor or the brady@@ cardiac responses to clonidine microinjected into the area near the ventrolateral surface of the medulla oblong@@ ata in rat@@ s. the data indicate that a bul@@ b@@ ospinal serotonergic pathway is involved in development of clonidine @-@ induced hypotension and brady@@ cardi@@ a. the induced hypotension is brought about by a decrease in sympathetic efferent activity , whereas the induced bradycardia was due to an increase in vagal efferent activity .
hypertension in neuroblastoma induced by imi@@ pr@@ amin@@ e. hypertension is a well @-@ known finding in some patients with neuro@@ bl@@ astom@@ a. however , it has not previously been described in association with the use of imi@@ pr@@ amin@@ e. we report the occurrence of severe hypertension ( blood pressure 190 / 160 ) in a 4 @-@ year @-@ old girl with neuroblastoma who was given imipramine to control a behavior dis@@ or@@ der@@ . it was determined later that this patient &apos;s tumor was recurring at the time of her hypertensive ep@@ iso@@ de@@ . since she had no blood pressure elevation at initial diagnosis and none following discontinuation of the imipramine ( when she was in flor@@ id relapse ) , we believe that this drug rather than her underlying disease alone caused her hyper@@ ten@@ sion@@ . the mechanism for this reaction is believed to be increased levels of vasoactive catecholamines due to interference of their physiologic inactivation by imi@@ pr@@ amin@@ e. from this experience , we urge extreme caution in the use of tricyclic antidepressants in children with active neuroblastoma .
re@@ challenge of patients who developed oral candidiasis or ho@@ arseness with bec@@ lom@@ ethasone di@@ propi@@ on@@ at@@ e. of 158 asthmatic patients who were placed on inhaled bec@@ lom@@ ethasone , 15 ( 9.5 % ) developed either ho@@ arseness ( 8 ) , oral th@@ r@@ ush ( 6 ) , or both ( 1 ) . when their adverse reactions subsided , seven of these 15 patients were re@@ challenged with inhaled bec@@ l@@ ometh@@ as@@ on@@ e. these included five cases who developed ho@@ arseness and three who developed candi@@ di@@ asi@@ s. one patient had bo@@ th@@ . oral th@@ r@@ ush did not recur , but 60 % ( 3 / 5 ) of patients with ho@@ arseness had recur@@ ren@@ c@@ e. we conclude that patients may be rest@@ ar@@ ted on inhaled bec@@ lom@@ ethasone when clinically indicated ; however , because of the high recurrence rate , patients who develop ho@@ arseness should not be re @-@ challeng@@ ed@@ . concomitant use of oral prednisone and topical bec@@ lom@@ ethasone may increase the risk of developing ho@@ arseness or candidiasis .
cyclophosphamide cardiotoxicity : an analysis of dosing as a risk factor@@ . patients who undergo bone marrow transplantation are generally immunosuppressed with a dose of cyclophosphamide ( cy@@ a ) which is usually calculated based on the patient &apos;s weigh@@ t. at these high doses of cy@@ a , serious cardiotoxicity may occur , but definitive risk factors for the development of such cardiotoxicity have not been describ@@ ed@@ . since chemotherapeutic agent toxicity generally correlates with dose per body surface area , we retrospectively calculated the dose of cy@@ a in patients transplanted at our institution to determine whether the incidence of cy@@ a cardiotoxicity correlated with the dose per body surface are@@ a. eighty patients who were to receive cy@@ a 50 mg / kg / d for four days as preparation for marrow grafting underwent a total of 84 transplants for aplastic anemia , wis@@ k@@ ot@@ t @-@ al@@ dr@@ ich syndrome , or severe combined immunodeficiency syn@@ dro@@ me@@ . fourteen of 84 ( 17 % ) patients had symptoms and signs consistent with cy@@ a cardiotoxicity within ten days of receiving 1 to 4 doses of cy@@ a. six of the 14 patients died with congestive heart fail@@ ure@@ . the dose of cy@@ a per body surface area was calculated for all patients and the patients were divided into two groups based on daily cy@@ a dose : group 1 , cy@@ a less than or equal to 1.55 g / m2 / d ; group 2 , cy@@ a greater than 1.55 g / m2 / d. cardiotoxicity that was thought to be related to cy@@ a occurred in 1 / 32 ( 3 % ) of patients in group 1 and in 13 / 52 ( 25 % ) patients in group 2 ( p less than 0.025 ) . congestive heart failure caused or contributed to death in 0 / 32 patients in group 1 v 6 / 52 ( 12 % ) of patients in group 2 ( p less than 0.25 ) . there was no difference in the rate of engraftment of evaluable patients in the two groups ( p greater than 0.5 ) . we conclude that the cy@@ a cardiotoxicity correlates with cy@@ a dosage as calculated by body surface area , and that patients with aplastic anemia and immuno@@ deficiencies can be effectively prepared for bone marrow grafting at a cy@@ a dose of 1.55 g / m2 / d for four days with a lower incidence of cardiotoxicity than patients whose cy@@ a dosage is calculated based on weigh@@ t. this study re@@ affir@@ ms the principle that drug toxicity correlates with dose per body surface area .
studies of risk factors for aminoglycoside nephro@@ toxic@@ it@@ y@@ . the epidemiology of aminoglycoside @-@ induced nephrotoxicity is not fully underst@@ o@@ od@@ . experimental studies in healthy human volunteers indicate aminoglycosides cause proximal tubular damage in most patients , but rarely , if ever , cause glomerular or tubular dys@@ function@@ . clinical trials of aminoglycosides in seriously ill patients indicate that the relative risk for developing acute renal failure during therapy ranges from 8 to 10 and that the attributable risk is 70 % to 80 % . further analysis of these data suggests that the duration of therapy , plasma aminoglycoside levels , liver disease , advanced age , high initial estimated creatinine clearance and , possibly , female gender all increase the risk for nephro@@ toxic@@ it@@ y@@ . other causes of acute renal failure , such as shock , appear to have an additive effec@@ t. predictive models have been developed from these analyses that should be useful for identifying patients at high ris@@ k@@ . these models may also be useful in developing insights into the pathophysiology of aminoglycoside @-@ induced nephrotoxicity .
flu@@ ro@@ th@@ yl seizure thresholds in mice treated neon@@ atally with a single injection of monos@@ odium glutamate ( ms@@ g ) : evaluation of experimental parameters in flu@@ ro@@ th@@ yl seizure tes@@ tin@@ g. monos@@ odium glutamate ( ms@@ g ) administration to neonatal rodents produces convulsions and results in numerous biochemical and behavioral defic@@ it@@ s. these studies were undertaken to determine if neonatal administration of ms@@ g produced permanent alterations in seizure susceptibility , since previous investigations were in@@ con@@ clu@@ si@@ ve@@ . a flu@@ ro@@ th@@ yl ether seizure screening technique was used to evaluate seizure susceptibility in adult mice that received neonatal injections of ms@@ g ( 4 mg / g and 1 mg / g ) . ms@@ g treatment resulted in significant reductions in whole brain weight but did not alter seizure thresh@@ ol@@ d. a naloxone ( 5 mg / kg ) challenge was also ineffective in altering the seizure thresholds of either control of ms@@ g @-@ treated mic@@ e. flu@@ ro@@ th@@ yl ether produced hypothermia which was correlated with the duration of flu@@ ro@@ th@@ yl exposure ; however , the relationship of hypothermia to seizure induction was un@@ cl@@ ear@@ . flu@@ ro@@ th@@ yl seizure testing proved to be a rapid and reliable technique with which to evaluate seizure susceptibility .
susceptibility to seizures produced by pilocarpine in rats after microinjection of isoniazid or gamma @-@ vinyl @-@ gab@@ a into the substantia nig@@ ra@@ . pilocarpine , given intraperitoneally to rats , reproduc@@ es the neuropathological sequelae of temporal lobe epilepsy and provides a relevant animal model for studying mechanisms of buil@@ dup of convulsive activity and pathways operative in the generalization and propagation of seizures within the fore@@ bra@@ in@@ . in the present study , the effects of manipulating the activity of the gamma @-@ aminobutyric acid ( gab@@ a ) -mediated synaptic inhibition within the substantia nigra on seizures produced by pilocarpine in rats , were investig@@ ated@@ . in animals pretreated with micro@@ injections of isoniazid , 150 micrograms , an inhibitor of activity of the gab@@ a @-@ synthesizing enzyme , l @-@ glutamic acid decarboxylase , into the substantia nigra pars reticul@@ ata ( sn@@ r ) , bilaterally , non @-@ convulsant doses of pilocarpine , 100 and 200 mg / kg , resulted in severe motor limbic seizures and status epilep@@ tic@@ us@@ . electroencephalographic and behavioral monitoring revealed a profound reduction of the threshold for pilocarpine @-@ induced convul@@ sion@@ s. morphological analysis of frontal forebrain sections with light microscopy revealed seizure @-@ related damage to the hippocampal formation , thalamus , amygdala , olfactory cortex , substantia nigra and neocortex , which is typically observed with pilocarpine in doses exceeding 350 mg / k@@ g. bilateral intra@@ striatal injections of isoniazid did not augment seizures produced by pilocarpine , 200 mg / k@@ g. application of an irreversible inhibitor of gab@@ a transaminase , gamma @-@ vinyl @-@ gab@@ a ( d , l @-@ 4 @-@ amino @-@ he@@ x @-@ 5 @-@ enoic acid ) , 5 micrograms , into the sn@@ r , bilaterally , suppressed the appearance of electro@@ graphic and behavioral seizures produced by pilocarpine , 380 mg / k@@ g. this treatment was also sufficient to protect animals from the occurrence of brain dam@@ ag@@ e. micro@@ injections of gamma @-@ vinyl @-@ gab@@ a , 5 micrograms , into the dorsal striatum , bilaterally , failed to prevent the development of convulsions produced by pilocarpine , 380 mg / k@@ g. the results demonstrate that the threshold for pilocarpine @-@ induced seizures in rats is subjected to the regulation of the gab@@ a @-@ mediated synaptic inhibition within the substantia nigra .
non @-@ invasive detection of coronary artery disease by body surface electrocardiographic mapping after dipyridamole infu@@ sion@@ . electrocardiographic changes after dipyridamole infusion ( 0.5@@ 68 mg / kg / 4 min ) were studied in 41 patients with coronary artery disease and compared with those after submaximal treadmill exercise by use of the body surface mapping techniqu@@ e. patients were divided into three groups ; 19 patients without myocardial infarction ( non @-@ mi group ) , 14 with anterior infarction ( ant @-@ mi ) and eight with inferior infarction ( in@@ f @-@ mi ) . eighty @-@ seven unipolar electrocardiograms ( ec@@ gs ) distributed over the entire thoracic surface were simultaneously recor@@ de@@ d. after dipyridamole , ischemic st @-@ segment depression ( 0.05 m@@ v or more ) was observed in 84 % of the non @-@ mi group , 29 % of the ant @-@ mi group , 63 % of the in@@ f @-@ mi group and 61 % of the total popul@@ ation@@ . exercise @-@ induced st depression was observed in 84 % of the non @-@ mi group , 43 % of the ant @-@ mi group , 38 % of the in@@ f @-@ mi group and 61 % of the tot@@ al@@ . for individual patients , there were no obvious differences between the body surface distribution of st depression in both test@@ s. the increase in pressure rate product after dipyridamole was significantly less than that during the treadmill exerc@@ is@@ e. the data suggest that the dipyridamole @-@ induced myocardial ischemia is caused by the in@@ homogenous distribution of myocardial blood flow@@ . we conclude that the dipyridamole ec@@ g test is as useful as the exercise ec@@ g test for the assessment of coronary artery disease .
bradycardia after high @-@ dose intravenous methylprednisolone therap@@ y@@ . in 5 consecutive patients with rheumatoid arthritis who received intravenous high @-@ dose methylprednisolone ( m@@ p ) therapy ( 1 g daily for 2 or 3 consecutive days ) , a decline in pulse rate was observed , most pronounced on day 4@@ . in one of the 5 patients the bradycardia was associated with complaints of sub@@ sternal pres@@ su@@ re@@ . reversal to normal heart rate was found on day 7@@ . electrocardiographic registr@@ ations showed sinus bradycardia in all cas@@ es@@ . no significant changes in plasma concentrations of electrolytes were found@@ . careful observation of patients receiving high @-@ dose m@@ p is recomm@@ ende@@ d. high @-@ dose m@@ p may be contraindicated in patients with known heart disease .
two cases of down@@ beat nystagmus and oscill@@ op@@ sia associated with carbam@@ azep@@ ine@@ . down@@ beat nystagmus is often associated with structural lesions at the cranioc@@ ervical junction , but has occasionally been reported as a manifestation of metabolic imbalance or drug intox@@ ic@@ ation@@ . we recorded the eye movements of two patients with reversible down@@ beat nystagmus related to carbamazepine therap@@ y@@ . the nystagmus of both patients resolved after reduction of the serum carbamazepine lev@@ el@@ s. neuro@@ radiologic investigations including magnetic resonance imaging scans in both patients showed no evidence of intracranial abnormal@@ it@@ y@@ . in patients with down@@ beat nystagmus who are taking anticonvulsant medications , consideration should be given to reduction in dose before further investigation is undertaken .
improvement by den@@ op@@ amine ( ta @-@ 0@@ 64 ) of pentobarbital @-@ induced cardiac failure in the dog heart @-@ lung prepar@@ ation@@ . the efficacy of den@@ op@@ amine , an orally active beta 1 @-@ adrenoceptor agonist , in improving cardiac failure was assessed in dog heart @-@ lung prepar@@ ation@@ s. cardiac functions depressed by pentobarbital ( 118 + / - 28 mg ; mean value + / - sd ) such that cardiac output and maximum rate of rise of left ventricular pressure ( l@@ v d@@ p / dt max ) had been reduced by about 35 % and 26 % of the respective controls were improved by den@@ op@@ amine ( 10 @-@ 300 micrograms ) in a dose @-@ dependent man@@ ner@@ . with 100 micrograms den@@ op@@ amine , almost complete restoration of cardiac performance was attained , associated with a slight increase in heart rat@@ e. no arrhythmias were induced by these doses of den@@ op@@ amin@@ e. the results warrant clinical trials of den@@ op@@ amine in the treatment of cardiac failure .
clon@@ azepam monotherapy for epilepsy in child@@ ho@@ od@@ . sixty patients ( age @-@ range one month to 14 years ) with other types of epilepsy than infantile spasms were treated with clon@@ azep@@ am@@ . disappearance of seizures and normalization of abnormal e@@ eg with disappearance of seizures were recognized in 77 % and 50 % , respec@@ ti@@ vel@@ y@@ . seizures disappeared in 71 % of the patients with generalized seizures and 89 % of partial seiz@@ u@@ res@@ . improvement of abnormal e@@ eg was noticed in 76 % of diffuse parox@@ ys@@ ms and in 67 % of focal parox@@ ys@@ m@@ s. in excellent cases , mean effective dosages were 0.0@@ 86 + / - 0.021 mg / kg / day in infants and 0.0@@ 57 + / - 0.022 mg / kg / day in schoolchildren , this difference was statistically significant ( p less than 0.005 ) . the incidence of side effects such as drow@@ siness and ataxia was only 5 % .
post@@ marketing study of timolol @-@ hydrochlorothiazide antihypertensive therap@@ y@@ . a post@@ marketing surveillance study was conducted to determine the safety and efficacy of a fixed @-@ ratio combination containing 10 mg of timolol maleate and 25 mg of hydrochlorothiazide , administered twice daily for one month to hypertensive patient@@ s. data on 9,@@ 0@@ 37 patients were collected by 1,4@@ 55 participating physi@@ ci@@ an@@ s. mean systolic blood pressure decreased 25 mm@@ h@@ g and mean diastolic blood pressure declined 15 mm@@ h@@ g after one month of timolol @-@ hydrochlorothiazide therapy ( p less than 0.01 , both comparisons ) . age , race , and sex appeared to have no influence on the decrease in blood pres@@ su@@ re@@ . the antihypertensive effect of the drug was greater in patients with more severe hyper@@ ten@@ sion@@ . overall , 1,4@@ 53 patients experienced a total of 2,6@@ 58 adverse events , the most common being fatigue , dizziness , and wea@@ kn@@ ess@@ . treatment in 590 patients was discontinued because of adverse events .
salicylate nephropathy in the gun@@ n rat : potential role of prostagland@@ in@@ s. we examined the potential role of prostaglandins in the development of analgesic nephropathy in the gun@@ n strain of rat@@ . the homozygous gun@@ n rats have unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia due to the absence of glucuron@@ yl transferase , leading to marked bilirubin deposition in renal medulla and papill@@ a. these rats are also highly susceptible to develop papillary necrosis with analgesic administr@@ ation@@ . we used homozygous ( j@@ j ) and phenotypically normal heterozygous ( j@@ j ) anim@@ al@@ s. four groups of rats ( n = 7 ) were studied : j@@ j and j@@ j rats treated either with aspirin 300 mg / kg every other day or sham @-@ treat@@ ed@@ . after one week , slices of cortex , outer and inner medulla from one kidney were incubated in buffer and prostaglandin synthesis was determined by radio@@ immuno@@ ass@@ ay@@ . the other kidney was examined hist@@ olog@@ ic@@ all@@ y@@ . a marked cor@@ ti@@ com@@ edullary gradient of prostaglandin synthesis was observed in all grou@@ ps@@ . p@@ ge@@ 2 synthesis was significantly higher in outer medulla , but not cortex or inner medulla , of j@@ j ( 38 + / - 6 ng / mg pro@@ t ) than j@@ j rats ( 15 + / - 3 ) ( p less than 0.01 ) . aspirin treatment reduced p@@ ge@@ 2 synthesis in all regions , but outer medullary p@@ ge@@ 2 remained higher in j@@ j ( 18 + / - 3 ) than j@@ j rats ( 9 + / - 2 ) ( p less than 0.05 ) . p@@ g@@ f2 alpha was also significantly higher in the outer medulla of j@@ j rats with and without aspirin administration ( p less than 0.05 ) . the changes in renal prostaglandin synthesis were accompanied by evidence of renal damage in aspirin @-@ treated j@@ j but not j@@ j rats as evidenced by : increased incidence and severity of hematuria ( p less than 0.01 ) ; increased serum creatinine ( p less than 0.05 ) ; and increase in outer medullary histopathologic lesions ( p less than 0.005 compared to either sham @-@ treated j@@ j or aspirin @-@ treated j@@ j ) . these results suggest that enhanced prostaglandin synthesis contributes to maintenance of renal function and morphological integrity , and that inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis may lead to pathological renal medullary lesions and deterioration of renal function .
prophylactic lidocaine in the early phase of suspected myocardial infarc@@ tion@@ . four hundred two patients with suspected myocardial infarction seen within 6 hours of the onset of symptoms entered a double @-@ blind randomized trial of lidocaine vs plac@@ e@@ bo@@ . during the 1 hour after administration of the drug the incidence of ventricular fibrillation or sustained ventricular tachycardia among the 204 patients with acute myocardial infarction was low , 1.5 % . lidocaine , given in a 300 mg dose intramuscularly followed by 100 mg intravenously , did not prevent sustained ventricular tachycardia , although there was a significant reduction in the number of patients with warning arrhythmias between 15 and 45 minutes after the administration of lidocaine ( p less than 0.05 ) . the average plasma lidocaine level 10 minutes after administration for patients without a myocardial infarction was significantly higher than that for patients with an acute infarc@@ tion@@ . the mean plasma lidocaine level of patients on beta @-@ blocking agents was no different from that in patients not on beta blocking ag@@ ent@@ s. during the 1 @-@ hour study period , the incidence of central nervous system side effects was significantly greater in the lidocaine group , hypotension occurred in 11 patients , nine of whom had received lidocaine , and four patients died from as@@ yst@@ ole , three of whom had had lid@@ oc@@ ain@@ e. we cannot advocate the administration of lidocaine prophyl@@ acti@@ cally in the early hours of suspected myocardial infarction .
evidence for a cholinergic role in haloperidol @-@ induced catal@@ ep@@ sy@@ . experiments in mice tested previous evidence that activation of cholinergic systems promotes catal@@ epsy and that cholinergic mechanisms need to be intact for full expression of neuroleptic @-@ induced catal@@ ep@@ sy@@ . large doses of the cholin@@ omimetic , pilocarpine , could induce catal@@ epsy when peripheral cholinergic receptors were bloc@@ k@@ ed@@ . low doses of pilocarpine caused a pronounced enhancement of the catal@@ epsy that was induced by the dopaminergic blocker , hal@@ oper@@ id@@ ol@@ . a muscarinic receptor blocker , atropine , disrupted haloperidol @-@ induced catal@@ ep@@ sy@@ . intracranial injection of an acetylcholine @-@ synthesis inhibitor , hem@@ ich@@ olinium , prevented the catal@@ epsy that is usually induced by hal@@ oper@@ id@@ ol@@ . these findings suggest the hypothesis that the catal@@ epsy that is produced by neuroleptics such as haloperidol is actually mediated by intrinsic central cholinergic system@@ s. alternatively , activation of central cholinergic systems could promote catal@@ epsy by suppression of dopaminergic systems .
cardiovascular dysfunction and hypersensitivity to sodium pentobarbital induced by chronic barium chloride ing@@ estion@@ . barium @-@ supplemented long @-@ ev@@ ans ho@@ oded rats were characterized by a persistent hypertension that was evident after 1 month of barium ( 100 micrograms / ml mineral fortified water ) treat@@ ment@@ . analysis of in vivo myocardial excitability , contractility , and metabolic characteristics at 16 months revealed other significant barium @-@ induced disturbances within the cardiovascular system@@ . the most distinctive aspect of the barium effect was a demonstrated hypersensitivity of the cardiovascular system to sodium pent@@ obarbit@@ al@@ . under barbit@@ urate anesthesia , virtually all of the myocardial contractile indices were depressed significantly in barium @-@ exposed rats relative to the corresponding control @-@ fed rat@@ s. the lack of a similar response to ketamine and xyl@@ azine anesthesia revealed that the cardiovascular actions of sodium pentobarbital in barium @-@ treated rats were linked specifically to this anesthetic , and were not representative of a generalized anesthetic respon@@ se@@ . other myocardial pathophysiologic and metabolic changes induced by barium were manifest , irrespective of the anesthetic employ@@ ed@@ . the contractile element shortening velocity of the cardiac muscle fibers was significantly slower in both groups of barium @-@ treated rats relative to the control groups , irrespective of the anesthetic reg@@ im@@ en@@ . similarly , significant disturbances in myocardial energy metabolism were detected in the barium @-@ exposed rats which were consistent with the reduced contractile element shortening vel@@ oc@@ it@@ y@@ . in addition , the excitability of the cardiac conduction system was depressed preferentially in the atrioventricular nodal region of hearts from barium @-@ exposed rat@@ s. overall , the altered cardiac contractility and excitability characteristics , the myocardial metabolic disturbances , and the hypersensitivity of the cardiovascular system to sodium pentobarbital suggest the existence of a here@@ to@@ fore undescribed cardiomy@@ opathic disorder induced by chronic barium expos@@ ure@@ . these experimental findings represent the first indication that life @-@ long barium ingestion may have significant adverse effects on the mammalian cardiovascular system .
propranolol antagonism of phenyl@@ propan@@ olamine @-@ induced hyper@@ ten@@ sion@@ . phenyl@@ propan@@ olamine ( pp@@ a ) overdose can cause severe hypertension , intracerebral hemorrhage , and de@@ ath@@ . we studied the efficacy and safety of propranolol in the treatment of pp@@ a @-@ induced hyper@@ ten@@ sion@@ . subjects received propranolol either by mouth for 48 hours before pp@@ a or as a rapid intravenous infusion after p@@ pa@@ . pp@@ a , 75 mg alone , increased blood pressure ( 31 + / - 14 mm h@@ g systolic , 20 + / - 5 mm h@@ g diastolic ) , and propranolol pretreatment antagonized this increase ( 12 + / - 10 mm h@@ g systolic , 10 + / - 7 mm h@@ g diastolic ) . intravenous propranolol after pp@@ a also decreased blood pres@@ su@@ re@@ . left ventricular function ( assessed by echocardiography ) showed that pp@@ a increased the stroke volume 30 % ( from 62.5 + / - 20.9 to 8@@ 0.8 + / - 22.4 ml ) , the ejection fraction 9 % ( from 64 % + / - 10 % to 70 % + / - 7 % ) , and cardiac output 14 % ( from 3.6 + / - 0.6 to 4.1 + / - 1.0 l / min ) . intravenous propranolol reversed these effec@@ ts@@ . systemic vascular resistance was increased by pp@@ a 28 % ( from 17@@ 10 + / - 200 to 2@@ 190 + / - 700 d@@ yne x sec / cm@@ 5 ) and was further increased by propranolol 22 % ( to 26@@ 60 + / - 1200 d@@ yne x sec / cm@@ 5 ) . we conclude that pp@@ a increases blood pressure by increasing systemic vascular resistance and cardiac output , and that propranolol antagonizes this increase by reversing the effect of pp@@ a on cardiac out@@ put@@ . that propranolol antagonizes the pressor effect of pp@@ a is in contrast to the interaction in which propranolol enhances the pressor effect of nore@@ pin@@ eph@@ r@@ ine@@ . this is probably because pp@@ a has less beta 2 activity than does norepinephrine .
mesangial function and glomerular sclerosis in rats with amin@@ onucle@@ oside nephro@@ si@@ s. the possible relationship between mesangial dysfunction and development of glomerular sclerosis was studied in the puromycin amin@@ onucle@@ oside ( pan ) mod@@ el@@ . five male w@@ istar rats received repeated subcutaneous pan injections ; five controls received saline on@@ ly@@ . after 4 weeks the pan rats were severely protein@@ uric ( 190 + / - 80 mg / 24 hr ) , and all rats were given colloidal carbon ( cc ) intrav@@ en@@ ous@@ ly@@ . at 5 months glomerular sclerosis was found in 7.6 + / - 3.4 % of the glomeruli of pan rats ; glomeruli of the controls were normal@@ . glomeruli of pan rats contained significantly more cc than glomeruli of contro@@ l@@ s. glomeruli with sclerosis contained significantly more cc than non @-@ sclerotic glomeruli in the same kidne@@ ys@@ . cc was preferentially localized within the sclerotic areas of the affected glomerul@@ i. since mesangial cc clearance from the mesang@@ ium did not change during chronic pan treatment , we conclude that this preferential cc localization within the lesions is caused by an increased cc uptake shortly after injection in apparent vulnerable areas where sclerosis will develop subsequ@@ ent@@ ly@@ . cluster analysis showed a random distribution of lesions in the pan glomeruli in concordance with the random localization of mesangial areas with dysfunction in this mod@@ el@@ . similar to the remnant kidney model in pan neph@@ rosis the development of glomerular sclerosis may be related to &quot; mesangial over@@ loading . &quot;
relationship between nicotine @-@ induced seizures and hippocampal nicotinic recep@@ tor@@ s. a controversy has existed for several years concerning the physiological relevance of the nicotinic receptor measured by alpha @-@ bun@@ ga@@ rotoxin bin@@ d@@ ing@@ . using mice derived from a classical f2 and back@@ cross genetic design , a relationship between nicotine @-@ induced seizures and alpha @-@ bun@@ ga@@ rotoxin nicotinic receptor concentration was found@@ . mice sensitive to the convulsant effects of nicotine had greater alpha @-@ bun@@ ga@@ rotoxin binding in the hippocampus than seizure insensitive mic@@ e. the binding sites from seizure sensitive and resistant mice were equally affected by treatment with dithiothreitol , trypsin or he@@ at@@ . thus it appears that the difference between seizure sensitive and insensitive animals may be due to a difference in hippocampal nicotinic receptor concentration as measured with alpha @-@ bun@@ ga@@ rotoxin binding .
the role of p @-@ aminophen@@ ol in acetaminophen @-@ induced nephrotoxicity : effect of bis ( p @-@ nitrophenyl ) phosphate on acetaminophen and p @-@ aminophen@@ ol nephrotoxicity and metabolism in f@@ ischer 344 rat@@ s. acetaminophen ( ap@@ ap ) produces proximal tubular necrosis in f@@ ischer 344 ( f@@ 344 ) rat@@ s. recently , p @-@ aminophen@@ ol ( pa@@ p ) , a known potent nephro@@ toxic@@ ant , was identified as a metabolite of ap@@ ap in f@@ 344 rat@@ s. the purpose of this study was to determine if pa@@ p formation is a requisite step in ap@@ ap @-@ induced nephro@@ toxic@@ it@@ y@@ . therefore , the effect of bis ( p @-@ nitrophenyl ) phosphate ( b@@ n@@ pp ) , an acyl@@ amidase inhibitor , on ap@@ ap and pa@@ p nephrotoxicity and metabolism was determin@@ ed@@ . b@@ n@@ pp ( 1 to 8 mm ) reduced ap@@ ap deacetylation and covalent binding in f@@ 344 renal cortical homogenates in a concentration @-@ dependent man@@ ner@@ . pretreatment of animals with b@@ n@@ pp prior to ap@@ ap or pa@@ p administration resulted in marked reduction of ap@@ ap ( 900 mg / kg ) nephrotoxicity but not pa@@ p nephro@@ toxic@@ it@@ y@@ . this result was not due to altered disposition of either ap@@ ap or acetylated metabolites in plasma or renal cortical and hepatic tissu@@ e. rather , b@@ n@@ pp pretreatment reduced the fraction of ap@@ ap excreted as pa@@ p by 64 and 75 % after ap@@ ap doses of 750 and 900 mg / k@@ g. b@@ n@@ pp did not alter the excretion of ap@@ ap or any of its non @-@ deacetyl@@ ated metabolites nor did b@@ n@@ pp alter excretion of pa@@ p or its metabolites after pa@@ p doses of 150 and 300 mg / k@@ g. therefore , the b@@ n@@ pp @-@ induced reduction in ap@@ ap @-@ induced nephrotoxicity appears to be due to inhibition of ap@@ ap deacetyl@@ ation@@ . it is concluded that pa@@ p formation , in vivo , accounts , at least in part , for ap@@ ap @-@ induced renal tubular necrosis .
morphine @-@ induced seizures in newborn inf@@ ant@@ s. two neonates suffered from generalized seizures during the course of intravenous morphine sulfate for post @-@ operative analge@@ si@@ a. they received morphine in doses of 32 micrograms / kg / hr and 40 micrograms / kg / hr larger than a group of 10 neonates who received 6 @-@ 24 micrograms / kg / hr and had no seiz@@ u@@ res@@ . plasma concentrations of morphine in these neonates was excessive ( 60 and 90 mg / ml ) . other known reasons for seizures were ruled out and the convulsions stopped a few hours after cessation of morphine and did not re@@ occur in the subsequent 8 mon@@ th@@ s. it is suggested that post @-@ operative intravenous morphine should not exceed 20 micrograms / kg / ml in neonates .
effect of vincristine sulfate on pseud@@ omonas infections in mon@@ ke@@ ys@@ . in rhesus monkeys , intravenous challenge with 0.6 x 10 ( 10 ) to 2.2 x 10 ( 10 ) pseud@@ omonas aeruginosa organisms caused acute illness of 4 to 5 days &apos; duration with spontaneous recovery in 13 of 15 monkeys ; blood cultures became negative 3 to 17 days after challeng@@ e. leukocytosis was observed in all mon@@ ke@@ ys@@ . intravenous or intratracheal inoculation of 2.0 to 2.5 mg of vincristine sulfate was followed by leukopenia in 4 to 5 day@@ s. intravenous inoculation of 4.2 x 10 ( 10 ) to 7.8 x 10 ( 10 ) py@@ ocin type 6 pseud@@ omonas organisms in monkeys given vincristine sulfate 4 days previously resulted in fatal infection in 11 of 14 monkeys , whereas none of four receiving pseud@@ omonas alone di@@ ed@@ . these studies suggest that an antim@@ et@@ abol@@ ite @-@ induced leukopenia predisposes to severe pseud@@ omonas sepsis and that such monkeys may serve as a biological model for study of comparative efficacy of antimicrobial agents .
central excitatory actions of flur@@ azep@@ am@@ . toxic actions of flur@@ azepam ( f@@ z@@ p ) were studied in cats , mice and rat@@ s. high doses caused an apparent central excitation , most clearly seen as clonic convulsions , superimposed on general de@@ pres@@ sion@@ . following a lethal dose , death was always associated with convul@@ sion@@ s. comparing the relative sensitivity to central depression and excitation revealed that rats were least likely to have convulsions at doses that did not first cause loss of consciousness , while cats most clearly showed marked central excitatory action@@ s. signs of f@@ z@@ p tox@@ ocity in cats included excessive saliv@@ ation , extreme ap@@ preh@@ ensive behavior , ret@@ ching , muscle tre@@ mor@@ s and convul@@ sion@@ s. an interaction between f@@ z@@ p and pentyl@@ enetetra@@ zol ( p@@ tz ) was shown by pre@@ treating mice with f@@ z@@ p before p@@ tz challeng@@ e. as a function of dose , f@@ z@@ p first protected against convulsions and de@@ ath@@ . at higher doses , however , convulsions again emerg@@ ed@@ . these doses of f@@ z@@ p were lower than those that would alone cause convul@@ sion@@ s. these results may be relevant to the use of f@@ z@@ p in clinical situations in which there is increased neural excitability , such as epilepsy or sedative @-@ hypnotic drug withdrawal .
evidence for cardiac beta 2 @-@ adrenoceptors in man@@ . we compared the effects of single doses of 50 mg atenolol ( cardi@@ oselective ) , 40 mg propranolol ( nonselective ) , and placebo on both exerc@@ is@@ e- and isoproterenol @-@ induced tachycardia in two experiments involving nine normal subjec@@ ts@@ . maximal exercise heart rate was reduced from 187 + / - 4 ( se@@ m ) after placebo to 146 + / - 7 bpm after atenolol and 138 + / - 6 bpm after propranolol , but there were no differences between the dru@@ g@@ s. the effects on isoproterenol tachycardia were determined before and after atropine ( 0.04 mg / kg iv ) . isoproterenol sensitivity was determined as the intravenous dose that increased heart rate by 25 bpm ( cd@@ 25 ) and this was increased from 1.8 + / - 0.3 micrograms after placebo to 38.9 + / - 8.3 micrograms after propranolol and 8.3 + / - 1.7 micrograms after at@@ enol@@ ol@@ . the difference in the effects of the two was signific@@ ant@@ . after atropine the cd@@ 25 was unchanged after placebo ( 2.3 + / - 0.3 micrograms ) and atenolol ( 7.7 + / - 1.3 micrograms ) ; it was reduced after propranolol ( 24.8 + / - 5.0 micrograms ) , but remained different from at@@ enol@@ ol@@ . this change with propranolol sensitivity was calculated as the apparent ka , this was unchanged by atropine ( 11.7 + / - 2.1 and 10.1 + / - 2.5 ml / ng ) . these data are consistent with the hypothesis that exercise @-@ induced tachycardia results largely from beta 1 @-@ receptor activation that is blocked by both cardi@@ oselective and nonselective drugs , whereas isoproterenol activates both beta 1- and beta 2 @-@ receptors so that after cardi@@ oselective blockade there remains a beta 2 @-@ component that can be blocked with a nonselective dru@@ g. while there appear to be beta 2 @-@ receptors in the human heart , their physiologic or pathologic roles remain to be defined .
hormones and risk of breast cancer@@ . this paper reports the results of a study of 50 menopausal women receiving hormonal replacement therap@@ y@@ . the majority ( 29 ) had surgical menopause ; their mean age was 4@@ 5.7 year@@ s. it was hypothesized that prog@@ es@@ tins could equilib@@ rate the effects of the estrogenic stimulation on the mammary and endometrial target tissues of women on hormonal replacement therap@@ y@@ . the treatment schedule consisted of conjugated estrogens ( pre@@ marin ) 1.25 mg / day for 21 days and medroxyprogesterone acetate 10 mg / day for 10 days in each mon@@ th@@ . the mean treatment period was 18 mon@@ th@@ s. during the follow @-@ up period , attention was paid to breast modifications as evidenced by symptomatology , physical examination , and plate therm@@ og@@ rap@@ hy@@ . mast@@ od@@ yn@@ ia was reported by 21 patients , and physical examination revealed a light increase in breast firm@@ ness in 12 women and a moderate increase in breast nod@@ ularity in 2 wom@@ en@@ . them@@ ography confirmed the existence of an excessive breast stimulation in 1 women who complained of moderate mast@@ od@@ yn@@ ia and in 5 of the 7 women who complained of severe mast@@ ody@@ ni@@ a. normalization was obtained by hal@@ ving the estrogen dos@@ e. these results suggest that hormonal replacement therapy can be safely prescribed if the following criteria are satisfied : 1 ) preliminary evaluation of patients from a clinical , metabolic , cytologic , and mammographic perspective ; 2 ) cyclic treatment schedule , with a progest@@ ative phase of 10 days ; and 3 ) periodic complete follow @-@ up , with accurate therm@@ ographic evaluation of the breast target tissues .
early infections in kidney , heart , and liver transplant recipients on cyclospor@@ ine@@ . eighty @-@ one renal , seventeen heart , and twenty @-@ four liver transplant patients were followed for infec@@ tion@@ . seventeen renal patients received azathioprine ( aza ) and prednisone as part of a randomized trial of immunosuppression with 21 cyclosporine @-@ and @-@ prednisone @-@ treated renal transplant patient@@ s. all others received cyclosporine and predn@@ is@@ on@@ e. the randomized aza patients had more overall infections ( p less than 0.05 ) and more non@@ viral infections ( p less than 0.02 ) than the randomized cyclosporine patient@@ s. heart and liver patients had more infections than cyclosporine renal patients but fewer infections than the aza renal patient@@ s. there were no infectious deaths in renal transplant patients on cyclosporine or aza , but infection played a major role in 3 out of 6 cardiac transplant deaths and in 8 out of 9 liver transplant de@@ ath@@ s. renal patients on cyclosporine had the fe@@ west bacte@@ re@@ mi@@ as@@ . analysis of site of infection showed a preponderance of abdominal infections in liver patients , intrathoracic infections in heart patients , and urinary tract infections in renal patient@@ s. pulmonary infections were less common in cyclosporine @-@ treated renal patients than in aza @-@ treated patients ( p less than 0.05 ) . aza patients had significantly more staphylococcal infections than all other transplant groups ( p less than 0.005 ) , and systemic fungal infections occurred only in the liver transplant grou@@ p. cytomegalovirus ( cm@@ v ) shedding or serological rises in antibody titer , or both occurred in 78 % of cyclosporine patients and 76 % of aza patient@@ s. of the cyclosporine patients , 15 % had symptoms related to cm@@ v infec@@ tion@@ . serological evidence for ep@@ stein bar@@ r virus infection was found in 20 % of 65 cyclosporine patients studi@@ ed@@ . three had associated symptoms , and one developed a lymphoma .
structure @-@ activity and dose @-@ effect relationships of the antagonism of picro@@ toxin @-@ induced seizures by cholecystokinin , fragments and analogues of cholecystokinin in mic@@ e. intraperitoneal administration of cholecystokinin octapeptide sulphate ester ( cc@@ k @-@ 8 @-@ se ) and non@@ sulph@@ ated cholecystokinin octapeptide ( cc@@ k @-@ 8 @-@ ns ) enhanced the latency of seizures induced by picro@@ toxin in mic@@ e. experiments with n@@ - and c @-@ terminal fragments revealed that the c @-@ terminal tetr@@ apeptide ( cc@@ k @-@ 5 @-@ 8 ) was the active centre of the cc@@ k octapeptide molec@@ ul@@ e. the analogues cc@@ k @-@ 8 @-@ se and cc@@ k @-@ 8 @-@ ns ( dose range 0.2 @-@ 6.4 mumol / kg ) and caerul@@ ein dose range 0.1 @-@ 0.8 mumol / kg ) showed bell @-@ shaped dose @-@ effect curves , with the greatest maximum inhibition for cc@@ k @-@ 8 @-@ n@@ s. the peptide cc@@ k @-@ 5 @-@ 8 had weak anticonvulsant activity in comparison to the oc@@ tap@@ eptides , 3.2 mumol / kg and larger doses of the reference drug , diazepam , totally prevented picro@@ toxin @-@ induced seizures and mortal@@ it@@ y@@ . the maximum effect of the peptides tested was less than that of di@@ azep@@ am@@ . experiments with analogues and derivatives of cc@@ k @-@ 5 @-@ 8 demonstrated that the effectiveness of the beta @-@ alanyl derivatives of cc@@ k @-@ 5 @-@ 8 were enhanced and that they were equipot@@ ent with cc@@ k @-@ 8 @-@ se@@ . of the cc@@ k @-@ 2 @-@ 8 analogues , ser ( so@@ 3@@ h ) 7 @-@ ac @-@ cc@@ k @-@ 2 @-@ 8 @-@ se and th@@ r ( so@@ 3@@ h ) 7 @-@ ac @-@ cc@@ k @-@ 2 @-@ 8 @-@ se and hy@@ p ( so@@ 3@@ h ) -@@ ac @-@ cc@@ k @-@ 2 @-@ 8 @-@ se were slightly more active than cc@@ k @-@ 8 @-@ se .
vasopressin as a possible contributor to hyper@@ ten@@ sion@@ . the role of vasopressin as a pressor agent to the hypertensive process was examin@@ ed@@ . vasopressin plays a major role in the pathogenesis of doc@@ a @-@ salt hypertension , since the elevation of blood pressure was not substantial in the rats with lithium @-@ treated diabetes insipidus after doc@@ a @-@ salt treat@@ ment@@ . administration of dd@@ av@@ p which has antidiuretic action but minimal vasop@@ ressor effect failed to increase blood pressure to the levels observed after administration of av@@ p. furthermore , the pressor action of vasopressin appears to be important in the development of this model of hypertension , since the enhanced pressor responsiveness to the hormone was observed in the initial stage of hyper@@ ten@@ sion@@ . increased secretion of vasopressin from neuro@@ hypophysis also promotes the function of the hormone as a pathogenetic factor in hyper@@ ten@@ sion@@ . an un@@ proportional release of vasopressin compared to plasma osmolality may be induced by the absence of an adjusting control of angiotensin ii forming and receptor binding capacity for sodium balance in the bra@@ in@@ . however , the role of vasopressin remains to be determined in human essential hypertension .

atrial thrombosis involving the heart of f @-@ 344 rats ing@@ esting quin@@ acrine hydrochlor@@ ide@@ . quin@@ acrine hydrochloride is toxic for the heart of f @-@ 344 rat@@ s. rats treated with 500 ppm quin@@ acrine hydrochloride in the diet all developed a high incidence of left atrial thrombo@@ si@@ s. the lesion was associated with cardiac hypertrophy and dilatation and focal myocardial de@@ gener@@ ation@@ . rats died from cardiac hypertrophy with severe acute and chronic congestion of the lungs , liver , and other organ@@ s. seventy percent of rats given 250 ppm quin@@ acrine hydrochloride and 1,000 ppm sodium nitrite simultaneously in the diet had thrombosis of the atria of the heart , while untreated control rats in this laboratory did not have atrial thrombo@@ si@@ s. sodium nitrite in combination with quin@@ acrine hydrochloride appeared to have no additional effect .
alternating sinus rhythm and intermittent sin@@ oatrial block induced by pro@@ pran@@ ol@@ ol@@ . alternating sinus rhythm and intermittent sin@@ oatrial ( s @-@ a ) block was observed in a 57 @-@ year @-@ old woman , under treatment for angina with 80 mg propranolol d@@ ail@@ y@@ . the electrocardiogram showed alternation of long and short p @-@ p intervals and occasional pa@@ us@@ es@@ . these pa@@ uses were always preceded by the short p @-@ p intervals and were usually followed by one or two p @-@ p intervals of 0.92 @-@ 0.95 s representing the basic sinus cycl@@ e. following these basic sinus cycles , alternating rhythm started with the longer p @-@ p inter@@ val@@ . the long p @-@ p intervals ranged between 1.04 @-@ 1.12 s and the short p @-@ p intervals between 0.80 @-@ 0.84 s , respec@@ ti@@ vel@@ y@@ . the duration of the pa@@ uses were equal or almost equal to one short plus one long p @-@ p interval or to twice the basic sinus cycl@@ e. in one recording a short period of regular sinus rhythm with intermittent 2 / 1 s @-@ a block was obser@@ ve@@ d. this short period of sinus rhythm was interrupted by sudden prolongation of the p @-@ p interval starting the alternative rhyth@@ m. there were small changes in the shape of the p waves and p @-@ r inter@@ val@@ s. s @-@ a conduction through two pathways , the first with 2 / 1 block the second having 0.12 @-@ 0.14 s longer conduction time and with occasional 2 / 1 block was proposed for the explanation of the alternating p @-@ p interval and other electrocardiographic features se@@ en@@ . atropine 1 mg given intravenously resulted in shortening of all p @-@ p intervals without changing the rhyth@@ m. the abnormal rhythm disappeared with the withdrawal of propranolol and when the drug was rest@@ ar@@ ted a 2 / 1 s @-@ a block was se@@ en@@ . this was accepted as evidence for propranolol being the cause of this conduction disorder .
antitumor effect , cardiotoxicity , and nephrotoxicity of doxorubicin in the ig@@ m solid immun@@ ocytoma @-@ bearing lo@@ u / m / w@@ s@@ l rat@@ . antitumor activity , cardiotoxicity , and nephrotoxicity induced by doxorubicin were studied in lo@@ u / m / w@@ s@@ l inbred rats each bearing a transplantable solid ig@@ m immun@@ ocyt@@ om@@ a. animals with a tumor ( diameter , 15.8 + / - 3.3 mm ) were treated with iv injections of doxorubicin on 5 consecutive days , followed by 1 weekly injection for 7 weeks ( dose range , 0.015 @-@ 4.0 mg / kg body wt ) . tumor regression was observed with 0.5 mg doxorubicin / k@@ g. complete disappearance of the tumor was induced with 1.0 mg doxorubicin / k@@ g. histologic evidence of cardiotoxicity scored as grade iii was only observed at a dose of 1.0 mg doxorubicin / k@@ g. light microscopic evidence of renal damage was seen above a dose of 0.5 mg doxorubicin / kg , which resulted in albuminuria and very low serum albumin lev@@ el@@ s. in the group that received 1.0 mg doxorubicin / kg , the serum albumin level decreased from 33.6 + / - 4.1 to 1.5 + / - 0.5 g / liter@@ . ascites and hydro@@ thorax were observed simult@@ ane@@ ous@@ ly@@ . the same experiments were performed with non @-@ tumor @-@ bearing rats , in which no major differences were obser@@ ve@@ d. in conclusion , antitumor activity , cardiotoxicity , and nephrotoxicity were studied simultaneously in the same lo@@ u / m / w@@ s@@ l rat@@ . albuminuria due to renal damage led to extremely low serum albumin levels , so ascites and hydro@@ thorax were not necessarily a consequence of the observed cardiomyopathy .
intraoperative bradycardia and hypotension associated with timolol and pilocarpine eye dro@@ ps@@ . a 69 @-@ yr @-@ old man , who was concurrently being treated with pilocarpine nitrate and timolol maleate eye drops , developed a bradycardia and became hypotensive during halothane anaes@@ thesi@@ a. both timolol and pilocarpine were subsequently identified in a 24 @-@ h collection of ur@@ ine@@ . timolol ( but not pilocarpine ) was detected in a sample of plasma removed during surgery ; the plasma concentration of timolol ( 2.6 ng ml @-@ 1 ) was consistent with partial beta @-@ adrenoceptor bloc@@ k@@ ade@@ . it is postulated that this action may have been enhanced during halothane anaesthesia with resultant bradycardia and hypot@@ en@@ sion@@ . pilocarpine may have had a contributory effect .
succin@@ ylcholine apnoea : attempted reversal with anti@@ cholin@@ ester@@ as@@ es@@ . anti@@ cholin@@ esterases were administered in an attempt to antagonize prolonged neuromuscular blockade following the administration of succin@@ ylcholine in a patient later found to be homozygous for atypical plasma cholin@@ ester@@ as@@ e. ed@@ roph@@ onium 10 mg , given 74 min after succin@@ ylcholine , when train @-@ of @-@ four stimulation was characteristic of phase ii block , produced partial antagonism which was not sustain@@ ed@@ . repeated doses of ed@@ roph@@ onium to 70 mg and neostigmine to 2.5 mg did not antagonize or augment the bloc@@ k@@ . spontaneous respiration recomm@@ enced 200 min after succin@@ ylcholine administr@@ ation@@ . it is concluded that anti@@ cholin@@ esterases are only partially effective in restoring neuromuscular function in succin@@ ylcholine apnoea despite muscle twitch activity typical of phase ii block .
effect of doxorubicin on &#91; omega @-@ i @-@ 131 &#93; hept@@ adec@@ anoic acid myocardial scintigraphy and echocardiography in dog@@ s. the effects of serial treatment with doxorubicin on dynamic myocardial scintigraphy with &#91; omega @-@ i @-@ 131 &#93; hept@@ adec@@ anoic acid ( i @-@ 131 ha ) , and on global left @-@ ventricular function determined echocardi@@ ographically , were studied in a group of nine mongrel dog@@ s. total extractable myocardial lipid was compared postmortem between a group of control dogs and doxorubicin @-@ treated dog@@ s. a significant and then progressive fall in global l@@ v function was observed at a cumulative doxorubicin dose of 4 mg / k@@ g. a significant increase in the myocardial t1 / 2 of the i @-@ 131 ha was observed only at a higher cumulative dose , 10 mg / k@@ g. no significant alteration in total extractable myocardial lipids was observed between control dogs and those treated with dox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in@@ . our findings suggest that the changes leading to an alteration of myocardial dynamic imaging with i @-@ 131 ha are not the initiating factor in doxorubicin cardiotoxicity .
hemodynamics and myocardial metabolism under deliberate hypot@@ en@@ sion@@ . an experimental study in dog@@ s. coronary blood flow , cardiac work and metabolism were studied in dogs under sodium nitroprusside ( sn@@ p ) and trim@@ et@@ aph@@ an ( t@@ m@@ p ) deliberate hypotension ( 20 % and 40 % mean pressure decrease from baseline ) . regarding the effects of drug @-@ induced hypotension on coronary blood flow , aortic and coronary sinus metabolic data ( ph , po@@ 2 , p@@ co@@ 2 ) we could confirm that nitroprusside hypotension could be safely used to 30 % mean blood pressure decrease from control , trim@@ et@@ aph@@ an hypotension to 20 % mean blood pressure decre@@ as@@ e. cardiac work was significantly reduced during sn@@ p hypot@@ en@@ sion@@ . myocardial o@@ 2 consumption and o@@ 2 availability were directly dependent on the coronary per@@ fu@@ sion@@ . careful invasive monitoring of the blood pressure , blood gases and of the ec@@ g st @-@ t segment is mandatory .
evidence for a selective brain noradrenergic involvement in the locomotor stimulant effects of amphetamine in the rat@@ . male rats received the noradrenaline neurotoxin d@@ sp@@ 4 ( 50 mg / kg ) 7 days prior to injection of d @-@ amphetamine ( 10 or 40 mumol / kg i.p. ) . the hyperactivity induced by d @-@ amphetamine ( 10 mumol / kg ) was significantly reduced by d@@ sp@@ 4 pre@@ treat@@ ment@@ . however , the increased re@@ ar@@ ings and the amphetamine @-@ induced stere@@ otyp@@ ies were not blocked by pretreatment with d@@ sp@@ 4@@ . the reduction of amphetamine hyperactivity induced by d@@ sp@@ 4 was blocked by pretreatment with the noradrenaline @-@ uptake blocking agent , desipramine , which prevents the neurotoxic action of d@@ sp@@ 4@@ . the present results suggest a selective involvement of central noradrenergic neurones in the locomotor stimulant effect of amphetamine in the rat .
accelerated junctional rhythms during oral verapamil therap@@ y@@ . this study examined the frequency of atrioventricular ( a@@ v ) dissociation and accelerated junctional rhythms in 59 patients receiving oral ver@@ ap@@ amil@@ . accelerated junctional rhythms and a@@ v dissociation were frequent in patients with supraventricular tachyarrhythmias , particularly a@@ v nodal re@@ entr@@ y@@ . verapamil administration to these patients led to an asymptomatic increase in activity of these junctional pac@@ em@@ ak@@ er@@ s. in patients with various chest pain syndromes , verapamil neither increased the frequency of junctional rhythms nor suppressed their role as escape rhythms under physiologically appropriate circumstances .
treatment of ovarian cancer with a combination of cis @-@ platinum , adriamycin , cyclophosphamide and hexam@@ ethyl@@ mel@@ amin@@ e. during the last 2 1 / 2 years , 38 patients with ovarian cancer were treated with a combination of cis@@ platinum ( cp@@ d@@ d ) , 50 mg / m2 , adriamycin , 30 mg / m2 , cyclophosphamide , 300 mg / m2 , on day 1 ; and hexam@@ ethyl@@ mel@@ amine ( h@@ mm ) , 6 mg / kg daily , for 14 day@@ s. each course was repeated monthly . 2 patients had stage ii , 14 stage iii and 22 stage iv disease . 14 of the 38 patients were previously treated with chemotherapy , 1 with radiation , 6 with both chemotherapy and radiation , and 17 did not have any treatment before cp@@ d@@ d combination . 31 of the 38 cases ( 8@@ 1.5 % ) demonstrated objective responses lasting for 2 months or more@@ . these responses were partial in 19 and complete in 12 cas@@ es@@ . hematologic toxicity was moderate and with reversible anemia developing in 71 % of patient@@ s. gastrointestinal side effects from cp@@ d@@ d were uni@@ ver@@ sal@@ . h@@ mm gastrointestinal toxicity necessitated discontinuation of the drug in 5 patient@@ s. severe nephrotoxicity was observed in 2 patients but was rever@@ si@@ ble@@ . there were no drug @-@ related deaths .

studies on the bradycardia induced by b@@ epri@@ dil@@ . b@@ epri@@ dil , a novel active compound for prophylactic treatment of anginal attacks , induced persistent bradycardia and a non @-@ specific anti @-@ tachycardi@@ al effect , the mechanisms of which were investigated in vitro and in viv@@ o. in vitro perfusion of b@@ epri@@ dil in the life @-@ support medium for isolated sin@@ o @-@ atrial tissue from rabbit heart , caused a reduction in action potential ( ap ) spike frequency ( recorded by k@@ cl microelectrodes ) starting at doses of 5 x 10 ( -6 ) m. this effect was dose @-@ dependent up to concentrations of 5 x 10 ( -5 ) m , where@@ upon blockade of sinus activity set in@@ . b@@ epri@@ dil at a dose of 5 x 10 ( -6 ) m , induced a concomitant reduction in ap amplitude ( falling from 71 + / - 8 m@@ v to 47 + / - 6 m@@ v ) , maximum systolic depolarization velocity ( phase 0 ) which fell from 1.85 + / - 0.35 v / s to 0.84 + / - 0.28 v / s , together with maximum diastolic depolarization velocity ( phase 4 ) which fell from 38 + / - 3 m@@ v / s to 24 + / - 5 m@@ v / s. in vivo injection of b@@ epri@@ dil at a dose of 5 mg / kg ( i.v. ) into 6 anaesthetized dogs which had undergone ablation of all the extrinsic cardiac afferent nerve supply , together with a bilateral medull@@ o @-@ adrenalectomy , caused a marked reduction in heart rate which fell from 9@@ 8.7 + / - 4.2 beats / min to 76 + / - 5.3 beats / min sustained for more than 45 min@@ . it is concluded that b@@ epri@@ dil reduces heart rate by acting directly on the sinus no@@ de@@ . this effect , which results in a flattening of the phase 0 and phase 4 slope , together with a longer ap duration , may be due to an increase in the time constants of slow inward ionic currents ( already demonstrated elsewhere ) , but also to an increased time constant for deactivation of the outward potassium current ( ip ) .

anti@@ rifampicin antibodies in acute rifampicin @-@ associated renal failure . 5 patients with acute renal failure ( 3 with thromb@@ openia and hemolysis ) induced by the re@@ introduction of rifampicin are describ@@ ed@@ . no correlation was found between the severity of clinical manifestations and the total dose taken by the patient@@ s. in all but 1 patient , anti@@ rifampicin antibodies were detec@@ te@@ d. antibodies suggested to be of the ig@@ m class were detected in all 3 patients with hematological dis@@ or@@ der@@ s. the pattern of non @-@ specific acute tubular necrosis found in the 2 biopsied patients , indistinguishable from that of ischemic origin , raised the possibility of a vascular @-@ mediated dam@@ ag@@ e. in 3 patients , the possibility of a triggering immuno@@ allergic mechanism is discussed .
cardiovascular effects of hypotension induced by adenosine triphosphate and sodium nitroprusside on dogs with denervated heart@@ s. adenosine triphosphate ( at@@ p ) and sodium nitroprusside ( sn@@ p ) are administered to patients to induce and control hypotension during anesthesi@@ a. sn@@ p is auth@@ orized for clinical use in us@@ a and u@@ k , and at@@ p is clinically used in other countries such as j@@ ap@@ an@@ . we investigated how these two drugs act on the cardiovascular systems of 20 dogs whose hearts had been denervated by a procedure we had de@@ vis@@ ed@@ . at@@ p ( 10 dogs ) or sn@@ p ( 10 dogs ) was administered to reduce mean arterial pressure by 30 % to 70 % of contro@@ l@@ . before , during and after induced hypotension , we measured major cardiovascular parameter@@ s. hypotension induced by at@@ p was accompanied by significant decreases in mean pulmonary arterial pressure ( p less than 0.001 ) , central venous pressure ( p less than 0.001 ) , left ventricular end @-@ diastolic pressure ( p less than 0.001 ) , total peripheral resistance ( p less than 0.001 ) , rate pressure product ( p less than 0.001 ) , total body oxygen consumption ( p less than 0.05 ) , and heart rate ( p less than 0.001 ) ; all these variables returned normal within 30 min after at@@ p was stop@@ ped@@ . cardiac output did not chang@@ e. during hypotension produced by sn@@ p similar decreases were observed in mean pulmonary arterial pressure ( p less than 0.01 ) , central venous pressure ( p less than 0.001 ) , left ventricular end @-@ diastolic pressure ( p less than 0.01 ) , total peripheral resistance ( p less than 0.001 ) , rate pressure product ( p less than 0.001 ) , and oxygen content difference between arterial and mixed venous blood ( p less than 0.05 ) , while heart rate ( p less than 0.001 ) and cardiac output ( p less than 0.05 ) were incre@@ as@@ ed@@ . recoveries of heart rate and left ventricular end @-@ diastolic pressure were not shown within 60 min after sn@@ p had been stop@@ ped@@ . both at@@ p and sn@@ p should act on the pacemaker tissue of the heart .

post @-@ su@@ x@@ am@@ ethonium pains in nig@@ erian surgical patient@@ s. contrary to an earlier report by cox@@ on , sc@@ oline pain occurs in af@@ r@@ ican ne@@ gro@@ es@@ . its incidence was determined in a prospective study involving a total of 100 nig@@ erian patients ( 50 out @-@ patients and 50 in @-@ patients ) . about 62 % of the out @-@ patients developed sc@@ oline pain as compared with about 26 % among the in @-@ patient@@ s. the abol@@ ition of muscle fascicul@@ ations ( by 0.0@@ 75@@ mg / kg dose of f@@ az@@ ad@@ inium ) did not influence the occurrence of sc@@ oline pain@@ . neither the type of induction agent ( al@@ th@@ esin or thi@@ opent@@ one ) nor the salt preparation of su@@ x@@ am@@ ethonium used ( chloride or bromide ) , affected the incidence of sc@@ oline pain .
medial changes in arterial spasm induced by l @-@ nore@@ pin@@ eph@@ r@@ ine@@ . in normal rats , the media of small arteries ( 0.4@@ --@@ 0.2 mm in diameter ) previously was shown to contain intracellular vacuoles , identified ultra@@ structurally as herni@@ ations of one smooth muscle cell into an@@ other@@ . the hypothesis that intense vasoconstriction would increase the number of such vacuoles has been te@@ ste@@ d. in the media of the saphenous artery and its distal branch , vasoconstriction induced by l @-@ norepinephrine produced many cell @-@ to @-@ cell hernias within 15 min@@ ut@@ es@@ . at 1 day their number was reduced to about 1 / 10 of the original numb@@ er@@ . by 7 days the vessel was almost restored to normal@@ . triple stimulation over 1 day induced more severe changes in the medi@@ a. these findings suggest that smooth muscle cells are susceptible to damage in the course of their specific function@@ . the experimental data are discussed in relation to medial changes observed in other instances of arterial spas@@ m. endothelial changes that developed in the same experimental model were described in a previous paper .

su@@ x@@ am@@ ethonium @-@ induced jaw stiffness and myalgia associated with atypical cholinesterase : case repor@@ t. an 11 @-@ year @-@ old boy was given halothane , nitrous oxide and oxygen , panc@@ uronium 0.4 mg and su@@ x@@ am@@ ethonium 100 mg for induction of anaes@@ thesi@@ a. in response to this a marked jaw stiffness occurred which lasted for two minutes and the anaesthesia were termin@@ ated@@ . four hours of apnoea ensu@@ ed and he suffered generalized severe myalgia lasting for one week@@ . he was found to have atypical plasma cholinesterase with a di@@ buc@@ aine number of 12 , indicating homozyg@@ oc@@ it@@ y@@ . this was verified by study of the famil@@ y@@ . the case shows that prolonged jaw rigidity and myalgia may occur after su@@ x@@ am@@ ethonium in patients with atypical cholinesterase despite pretreatment with panc@@ uronium .
indomethacin @-@ induced hyperkalemia in three patients with g@@ out@@ y arth@@ ri@@ tis@@ . we describe three patients in whom severe , life @-@ threatening hyperkalemia and renal insufficiency developed after treatment of acute g@@ out@@ y arthritis with in@@ dometh@@ acin@@ . this complication may result from an inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis and consequent hypo@@ ren@@ in@@ emic hypo@@ a@@ ido@@ steron@@ is@@ m. careful attention to renal function and potassium balance in patients receiving indomethacin or other nonsteroidal anti @-@ inflammatory agents , particularly in those patients with diabetes mellitus or preexisting renal disease , will help prevent this potentially serious complication .
etom@@ idate : a fores@@ hor@@ ten@@ ed clinical tri@@ al@@ . a clinical evaluation of etom@@ idate for outpatient cystoscopy was emb@@ ar@@ ked up@@ on@@ . un@@ pre@@ medicated patients were given fentanyl 1 microgram / kg followed by etom@@ idate 0.3 mg / k@@ g. anaesthesia was maintained with intermittent etom@@ idate in 2 @-@ 4 mg dos@@ es@@ . patients were interviewed person@@ ally later the same day , and by questionnaire three to four weeks later@@ . the trial was discontinued after 20 cases because of an unacceptable incidence of side effec@@ ts@@ . venous pain occurred in 68 % of patients and 50 % had redness , pain or swelling related to the injection site , in some cases lasting up to three weeks after anaes@@ thesi@@ a. skeletal movements occurred in 50 % of patients ; 30 % experienced respiratory up@@ set , one sufficiently severe to necessitate aband@@ oning the techniqu@@ e. nausea and vomiting occurred in 40 % and 25 % had disturbing emergence psychoses .
levodopa @-@ induced dys@@ kine@@ sias are improved by flu@@ ox@@ eti@@ ne@@ . we evaluated the severity of motor disability and dys@@ kine@@ sias in seven levodopa @-@ responsive patients with parkin@@ son &apos;s disease after an acute challenge with the mixed dopamine agonist , apomorphine , before and after the administration of fluoxetine ( 20 mg twice per day ) for 11 + / - 1 day@@ s. after fluoxetine treatment , there was a significant 47 % improvement ( p &lt; 0.05 ) of apomorphine @-@ induced dys@@ kine@@ sias without modification of parkinsonian motor dis@@ abil@@ it@@ y@@ . the dys@@ kine@@ sias were reduced predominantly in the lower limbs during the onset and disappearance of dyst@@ onic dys@@ kine@@ sias ( on@@ set@@ - and end @-@ of @-@ dose dys@@ kine@@ sias ) and in the upper limbs during chore@@ ic mid @-@ dose dys@@ kine@@ si@@ as@@ . the results suggest that increased brain seroton@@ inergic transmission with fluoxetine may reduce lev@@ od@@ opa@@ - or dopamine agonist @-@ induced dys@@ kine@@ sias without aggrav@@ ating parkinsonian motor disability .
a large population @-@ based follow @-@ up study of trimethoprim @-@ sulfamethoxazole , trimethoprim , and cephal@@ exin for uncommon serious drug toxic@@ it@@ y@@ . we conducted a population @-@ based 45 @-@ day follow @-@ up study of 23@@ 2,@@ 390 people who were prescribed trimethoprim @-@ sulfamethoxazole ( t@@ m@@ p @-@ sm@@ z ) , 26@@ 6,@@ 9@@ 51 prescribed trimethoprim alone , and 19@@ 6,@@ 397 prescribed cephal@@ exin , to estimate the risk of serious liver , blood , skin , and renal disorders resulting in referral or hospitalization associated with these dru@@ g@@ s. the results were based on information recorded on office computers by selected general practitioners in the un@@ ited k@@ ingdom , together with a review of clinical recor@@ ds@@ . the risk of clinically important idiopathic liver disease was similar for persons prescribed t@@ m@@ p @-@ sm@@ z ( 5.2 / 100,000 ) and those prescribed trimethoprim alone ( 3.8 / 100,000 ) . the risk for those prescribed cephal@@ exin was somewhat lower ( 2.0 / 100,000 ) . only five patients experienced blood disorders , one of whom was exposed to t@@ m@@ p @-@ sm@@ z ; of seven with erythema multiforme and st@@ ev@@ ens @-@ jo@@ hn@@ son syndrome , four were exposed to t@@ m@@ p @-@ sm@@ z@@ . the one case of toxic epidermal necro@@ lysis occurred in a patient who took cephal@@ ex@@ in@@ . finally , only five cases of acute parenchymal renal disease occurred , none likely to be caused by a study dru@@ g. we conclude that the risk of the serious diseases studied is small for the three agents , and compares reasonably with the risk for many other antibiotics .

mechanisms for protective effects of free radical scavengers on gentamicin @-@ mediated nephropathy in rat@@ s. studies were performed to examine the mechanisms for the protective effects of free radical scavengers on gentamicin ( gm ) -mediated nephro@@ path@@ y@@ . administration of gm at 40 mg / kg sc for 13 days to rats induced a significant reduction in renal blood flow ( r@@ b@@ f ) and inulin clearance ( cin ) as well as marked tubular dam@@ ag@@ e. a significant reduction in urinary guanosine 3 &apos; , 5 &apos; -cyclic monophosphate ( c@@ gm@@ p ) excretion and a significant increase in renal cortical renin and endothelin @-@ 1 contents were also observed in gm @-@ mediated nephro@@ path@@ y@@ . superoxide dismutase ( s@@ od ) or dimethyl@@ thiourea ( d@@ mt@@ u ) significantly less@@ ened the gm @-@ induced decrement in cin@@ . the s@@ od @-@ induced increase in glomerular filtration rate was associated with a marked improvement in r@@ b@@ f , an increase in urinary c@@ gm@@ p excretion , and a decrease in renal renin and endothelin @-@ 1 cont@@ ent@@ . s@@ od did not attenuate the tubular dam@@ ag@@ e. in contrast , d@@ mt@@ u significantly reduced the tubular damage and lipid peroxidation , but it did not affect renal hemodynamics and vasoactive subst@@ anc@@ es@@ . neither s@@ od nor d@@ mt@@ u affected the renal cortical gm content in gm @-@ treated rat@@ s. these results suggest that 1 ) both s@@ od and d@@ mt@@ u have protective effects on gm @-@ mediated nephropathy , 2 ) the mechanisms for the protective effects differ for s@@ od and d@@ mt@@ u , and 3 ) superoxide anions play a critical role in gm @-@ induced renal vasoconstriction .
assessment of cardiomyocyte d@@ na synthesis during hypertrophy in adult mic@@ e. the ability of cardiomyocytes to synthesize d@@ na in response to experimentally induced cardiac hypertrophy was assessed in adult mic@@ e. isoproterenol delivered by osmotic minip@@ ump implantation in adult c@@ 3@@ he@@ b / fe@@ j mice resulted in a 46 % increase in heart weight and a 19.3 % increase in cardiomyocyte are@@ a. no d@@ na synthesis , as assessed by autoradiographic analysis of isolated cardiomyocytes , was observed in control or hypertrophic heart@@ s. a survey of 15 independent inbred strains of mice revealed that ventricular cardiomyocyte nuclear number ranged from 3 to 13 % mononucle@@ ate , suggesting that cardiomyocyte terminal differentiation is influenced directly or indirectly by genetic back@@ ground@@ . to determine whether the capacity for reactive d@@ na synthesis was also subject to genetic regulation , cardiac hypertrophy was induced in the strains of mice comprising the extremes of the nuclear number surve@@ y@@ . these data indicate that adult mouse atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes do not synthesize d@@ na in response to isoproterenol @-@ induced cardiac hypertrophy .
central cardiovascular effects of av@@ p and an@@ p in normotensive and spontaneously hypertensive rat@@ s. the purpose of the present study was to compare influence of central arginine vasopressin ( av@@ p ) and of atrial natriuretic peptide ( an@@ p ) on control of arterial blood pressure ( map ) and heart rate ( hr ) in normotensive ( w@@ ky ) and spontaneously hypertensive ( sh@@ r ) rat@@ s. three series of experiments were performed on 30 w@@ ky and 30 sh@@ r , chronically instrumented with guide tubes in the lateral ventricle ( l@@ v ) and arterial and venous catheter@@ s. map and hr were monitored before and after i.v. injections of either vehicle or 1 , 10 and 50 ng of av@@ p and 25 , 125 and 500 ng of an@@ p. sensitivity of cardiac component of baroreflex ( cc@@ b ) , expressed as a slope of the regression line was determined from relationships between systolic arterial pressure ( sap ) and hr period ( hr@@ p ) during phenylephrine ( ph@@ e ) -induced hypertension and sodium nitroprusside ( sn ) -induced hypot@@ en@@ sion@@ . cc@@ b was measured before and after administration of either vehicle , av@@ p , an@@ p , or both peptides t@@ oge@@ ther@@ . increases of map occurred after l@@ v administration of 1 , 10 and 50 ng of av@@ p in w@@ ky and of 10 and 50 ng in sh@@ r@@ . an@@ p did not cause significant changes in map in both strains as compared to vehicle , but it abolished av@@ p @-@ induced map increase in w@@ ky and sh@@ r@@ . cc@@ b was reduced in w@@ ky and sh@@ r after l@@ v administration of av@@ p during sn @-@ induced hypot@@ en@@ sion@@ . in sh@@ r but not in w@@ ky administration of an@@ p , av@@ p and an@@ p + av@@ p decreased cc@@ b during ph@@ e @-@ induced map elev@@ ation@@ . the results indicate that centrally applied av@@ p and an@@ p exert differential effects on blood pressure and baroreflex control of heart rate in w@@ ky and sh@@ r and suggest interaction of these two peptides in blood pressure regulation at the level of central nervous system .

doxorubicin @-@ induced cardiotoxicity monitored by ec@@ g in freely moving mic@@ e. a new model to test potential protec@@ tor@@ s. in laboratory animals , histology is most commonly used to study doxorubicin @-@ induced cardi@@ otoxic@@ it@@ y@@ . however , for monitoring during treatment , large numbers of animals are ne@@ ede@@ d. recently we developed a new method to measure ec@@ g values in freely moving mice by telem@@ etr@@ y@@ . with this model we investigated the effect of chronic doxorubicin administration on the ec@@ g of freely moving bal@@ b / c mice and the efficacy of ic@@ r@@ f @-@ 187 as a protective ag@@ ent@@ . the st interval significantly wid@@ ened from 15.0 + / - 1.5 to 5@@ 6.8 + / - 11.8 ms in week 10 ( 7 weekly doses of 4 mg / kg doxorubicin given i.v. plus 3 weeks of observation ) . the ec@@ g of the control animals did not change during the entire stud@@ y@@ . after sacrifice the hearts of doxorubicin @-@ treated animals were enlarged and the atria were hypertroph@@ ic@@ . as this schedule exerted more toxicity than needed to investigate protective agents , the protection of ic@@ r@@ f @-@ 187 was determined using a dose schedule with lower general toxicity ( 6 weekly doses of 4 mg / kg doxorubicin given i.v. plus 2 weeks of observation ) . on this schedule , the animals &apos; hearts appeared normal after sacrifice and ic@@ r@@ f @-@ 187 ( 50 mg / kg given i.p. 1 h before doxorubicin ) provided almost full protec@@ tion@@ . these data were confirmed by hist@@ olog@@ y@@ . the results indicate that this new model is very sensitive and enables monitoring of the development of cardiotoxicity with time@@ . these findings result in a model that allows the testing of protec@@ tors against doxorubicin @-@ induced cardiotoxicity as demonstrated by the protection provided by ic@@ r@@ f @-@ 187 .
epinephrine dys@@ rhyth@@ m@@ ogenicity is not enhanced by sub@@ toxic bupivacaine in dog@@ s. since bupivacaine and epinephrine may both precipitate dys@@ rhyth@@ mias , circulating bupivacaine during regional anesthesia could potentiate dys@@ rhyth@@ mogenic effects of ep@@ in@@ eph@@ r@@ ine@@ . we therefore examined whether bupivacaine alters the dys@@ rhyth@@ m@@ ogenicity of subsequent administration of epinephrine in conscious , healthy dogs and in anesthetized dogs with myocardial infarc@@ tion@@ . forty @-@ one conscious dogs received 10 micrograms.@@ kg @-@ 1.min @-@ 1 ep@@ in@@ eph@@ r@@ ine@@ . seventeen animals responded with ventricular tachycardia ( v@@ t ) within 3 min@@ . after 3 h , these responders randomly received 1 or 2 mg / kg bupivacaine or saline over 5 min , followed by 10 micrograms.@@ kg @-@ 1.min @-@ 1 ep@@ in@@ eph@@ r@@ ine@@ . in the bupivacaine groups , epinephrine caused fewer pro@@ dys@@ rhythmic effects than without bup@@ ivac@@ ain@@ e. v@@ t appeared in fewer dogs and at a later time , and there were more sin@@ oatrial beats and less ectop@@ i@@ es@@ . epinephrine shortened q@@ t less after bupivacaine than in control anim@@ al@@ s. one day after experimental myocardial infarction , six additional halothane @-@ anesthetized dogs received 4 micrograms.@@ kg @-@ 1.min @-@ 1 epinephrine until v@@ t appe@@ are@@ d. after 45 min , 1 mg / kg bupivacaine was injected over 5 min , again followed by 4 micrograms.@@ kg @-@ 1.min @-@ 1 ep@@ in@@ eph@@ r@@ ine@@ . in these dogs , the pro@@ dys@@ rhythmic response to epinephrine was also mitigated by preceding bup@@ ivac@@ ain@@ e. bupivacaine antagonizes epinephrine dys@@ rhyth@@ m@@ ogenicity in conscious dogs susceptible to v@@ t and in anesthetized dogs with spontaneous postin@@ far@@ ct dys@@ rhyth@@ mi@@ as@@ . there is no evidence that systemic sub@@ toxic bupivacaine administration enhances the dys@@ rhyth@@ m@@ ogenicity of subsequent epinephrine .

chronic hyperprolactinemia and changes in dopamine neuron@@ s. the tuber@@ o@@ infun@@ dibular dopaminergic ( tida ) system is known to inhibit prolactin ( pr@@ l ) secre@@ tion@@ . in young animals this system responds to acute elevations in serum pr@@ l by increasing its activ@@ it@@ y@@ . however , this responsiveness is lost in aging rats with chronically high serum pr@@ l lev@@ el@@ s. the purpose of this study was to induce hyperprolactinemia in rats for extended periods of time and examine its effects on dopaminergic systems in the bra@@ in@@ . hyperprolactinemia was induced by treatment with haloperidol , a dopamine receptor antagonist , and pal@@ k@@ ov@@ its &apos; microdissection technique in combination with high @-@ performance liquid chromatography was used to measure neurotransmitter concentrations in several areas of the bra@@ in@@ . after 6 months of hyperprolactinemia , dopamine ( da ) concentrations in the median eminence ( me ) increased by 84 % over the control grou@@ p. nine months of hyperprolactinemia produced a 50 % increase in da concentrations in the me over the control grou@@ p. however , da response was lost if a 9 @-@ month long haloperidol @-@ induced hyperprolactinemia was followed by a 1 1 / 2 month @-@ long extremely high increase in serum pr@@ l levels produced by implantation of mm@@ q cells under the kidney capsul@@ e. there was no change in the levels of da , norepinephrine ( ne ) , serotonin ( 5 @-@ h@@ t ) , or their metabolites in the arcuate nucleus ( an ) , medial preoptic area ( mp@@ a ) , caudate putamen ( cp ) , substantia nigra ( sn ) , and zona inc@@ er@@ ta ( zi ) , except for a decrease in 5 @-@ hydroxy@@ indole@@ acetic acid ( 5 @-@ hi@@ aa ) in the an after 6 @-@ months of hyperprolactinemia and an increase in da concentrations in the an after 9 @-@ months of hyperprolactin@@ em@@ i@@ a. these results demonstrate that hyperprolactinemia specifically affects tida neurons and these effects vary , depending on the duration and intensity of hyperprolactin@@ em@@ i@@ a. the age @-@ related decrease in hypothalamic dopamine function may be associated with increases in pr@@ l secretion .

thrombotic complications in acute promyelocytic leukemia during all @-@ trans @-@ retinoic acid therap@@ y@@ . a case of acute renal failure , due to occlusion of renal vessels in a patient with acute promyelocytic leukemia ( ap@@ l ) treated with all @-@ trans @-@ retinoic acid ( atr@@ a ) and tranexamic acid has been described rec@@ ent@@ ly@@ . we report a case of acute renal failure in an ap@@ l patient treated with atr@@ a al@@ on@@ e. this case further supports the concern about thromboembolic complications associated with atr@@ a therapy in ap@@ l patient@@ s. the patients , a 43 @-@ year @-@ old man , presented all the signs and symptoms of ap@@ l and was included in a treatment protocol with at@@ ra@@ . after 10 days of treatment , he developed acute renal failure that was completely reversible after complete remission of ap@@ l was achieved and therapy discontinu@@ ed@@ . we conclude that atr@@ a is a valid therapeutic choice for patients with ap@@ l , although the procoagulant tendency is not completely correc@@ te@@ d. thrombotic events , however , could be avoided by using low @-@ dose heparin .
pupillary changes associated with the development of stimulant @-@ induced mania : a case repor@@ t. a 30 @-@ year @-@ old cocaine @-@ dependent man who was a subject in a study evaluating the antic@@ ra@@ ving efficacy of the stimulant medication diethyl@@ propion ( de@@ p ) became manic during his second week on the study dru@@ g. pup@@ ill@@ ometric changes while on de@@ p , especially changes in the total power of pupillary oscillation , were dramatically different than those observed in the eight other study subjects who did not become man@@ ic@@ . the large changes in total power of pupillary oscillation occurred a few days before the patient became fully man@@ ic@@ . such medication @-@ associated changes in the total power of pupillary oscillation might be of utility in identifying persons at risk for manic @-@ like adverse effects during the medical use of psychomotor stimulants or sympath@@ omimetic agents .
the negative mucosal potential : separating central and peripheral effects of n@@ sa@@ ids in man@@ . objective : we wanted to test whether assessment of both a central pain @-@ related signal ( chemo @-@ somatosensory evoked potential , cs@@ se@@ p ) and a concomitantly recorded peripheral signal ( negative mucosal potential , nm@@ p ) allows for separation of central and peripheral effects of n@@ sa@@ id@@ s. for this purpose , experimental conditions were created in which n@@ sa@@ ids had previously been observed to produce effects on phasic and tonic pain by either central or peripheral mechanis@@ m@@ s. methods : according to a double @-@ blind , randomised , controlled , threefold cross @-@ over design , 18 healthy subjects ( 11 males , 7 females ; mean age 26 years ) received either placebo , 400 mg ibuprofen , or 800 mg ibu@@ prof@@ en@@ . phasic pain was applied by means of short pulses of co@@ 2 to the nasal mucosa ( stimulus duration 500 ms , interval approximately 60 s ) , and tonic pain was induced in the nasal cavity by means of dry air of controlled temperature , humidity and flow rate ( 22 degrees c , 0 % relative humidity , 145 ml.@@ s @-@ 1 ) . both cs@@ se@@ ps as central and nm@@ ps as peripheral correlates of pain were obtained in response to the co@@ 2 stimul@@ i. additionally , the subjects rated the intensity of both phasic and tonic pain by means of visual analogue scal@@ es@@ . results : as described earlier , administration of ibuprofen was followed by a decrease in tonic pain but @-@ relative to placebo @-@ an increase in correlates of phasic pain , indicating a specific effect of ibuprofen on the interaction between the pain stimuli under these special experimental condi@@ tion@@ s. based on the similar behaviour of cs@@ se@@ p and nm@@ p , it was concluded that the pharmacological process underlying this phenomenon was localised in the periph@@ ery@@ . by means of the simultaneous recording of interrelated peripheral and central electrophysiologic correlates of nociception , it was possible to separate central and peripheral effects of an n@@ sa@@ id@@ . the major advantage of this pain model is the possibility of obtaining peripheral pain @-@ related activity directly using a non @-@ invasive technique in humans .

hyper@@ osmolar non@@ ket@@ otic coma precipitated by lithium @-@ induced nephro@@ genic diabetes insi@@ p@@ id@@ us@@ . a 45 @-@ year @-@ old man , with a 10 @-@ year history of manic depression treated with lithium , was admitted with hyper@@ osmolar , non@@ ket@@ otic com@@ a. he gave a five @-@ year history of poly@@ uria and poly@@ dip@@ sia , during which time urinalysis had been negative for glucos@@ e. after recovery from hyperglycaemia , he remained poly@@ uric despite normal blood glucose concentrations ; water deprivation testing indicated nephro@@ genic diabetes insipidus , likely to be lithium @-@ induc@@ ed@@ . we hypothesize that when this man developed type 2 diabetes , chronic poly@@ uria due to nephro@@ genic diabetes insipidus was sufficient to precipitate hyper@@ osmolar dehydration .
effects of the intracoronary infusion of cocaine on left ventricular systolic and diastolic function in human@@ s. background : in dogs , a large amount of intravenous cocaine causes a profound deterioration of left ventricular ( l@@ v ) systolic function and an increase in l@@ v end @-@ diastolic pres@@ su@@ re@@ . this study was done to assess the influence of a high intracoronary cocaine concentration on l@@ v systolic and diastolic function in human@@ s. methods and results : in 20 patients ( 14 men and 6 women aged 39 to 72 years ) referred for cardiac catheterization for the evaluation of chest pain , we measured heart rate , systemic arterial pressure , l@@ v pressure and its first derivative ( d@@ p / dt ) , and l@@ v volumes and ejection fraction before and during the final 2 to 3 minutes of a 15 @-@ minute intracoronary infusion of saline ( n = 10 , control subjects ) or cocaine hydrochloride 1 mg / min ( n = 10 ) . no variable changed with sal@@ ine@@ . with cocaine , the drug concentration in blood obtained from the coronary sinus was 3.0 + / -0.4 ( mean + / -@@ sd ) mg / l , similar in magnitude to the blood cocaine concentration reported in abusers dying of cocaine intox@@ ic@@ ation@@ . cocaine induced no significant change in heart rate , l@@ v d@@ p / dt ( positive or negative ) , or l@@ v end @-@ diastolic volume , but it caused an increase in systolic and mean arterial pressures , l@@ v end @-@ diastolic pressure , and l@@ v end @-@ systolic volume , as well as a decrease in l@@ v ejection fraction@@ . conclusions : in humans , the intracoronary infusion of cocaine sufficient in amount to achieve a high drug concentration in coronary sinus blood causes a deterioration of l@@ v systolic and diastolic performance .

pall@@ id@@ otomy with the gamma knife : a positive experience . 51 patients with medically refractory parkin@@ son &apos;s disease underwent stereotactic poster@@ omedial pall@@ id@@ otomy between aug@@ ust 1993 and fe@@ b@@ ruary 1997 for treatment of brady@@ kinesia , rigidity , and l @-@ dopa @-@ induced dys@@ kine@@ si@@ as@@ . in 29 patients , the pall@@ id@@ otomies were performed with the le@@ k@@ sell gamma knife and in 22 they were performed with the standard radiofrequency ( r@@ f ) method@@ . clinical assessment as well as blinded ratings of unified parkin@@ son &apos;s disease rating scale ( up@@ dr@@ s ) scores were carried out pre- and post@@ oper@@ ati@@ vel@@ y@@ . mean follow @-@ up time is 20.6 months ( range 6 @-@ 48 ) and all except 4 patients have been followed more than one year . 85 percent of patients with dys@@ kine@@ sias were relieved of symptoms , regardless of whether the pall@@ id@@ otomies were performed with the gamma knife or radiofrequency method@@ s. about 2 / 3 of the patients in both gamma knife and radiofrequency groups showed improvements in brady@@ kinesia and rigidity , although when considered as a group neither the gamma knife nor the radiofrequency group showed statistically significant improvements in up@@ dr@@ s sco@@ res@@ . one patient in the gamma knife group ( 3.4 % ) developed a hom@@ onymous hemi@@ an@@ op@@ sia 9 months following treatment and 5 patients ( 27.7 % ) in the radiofrequency group became transiently confused post@@ oper@@ ati@@ vel@@ y@@ . no other complications were se@@ en@@ . gamma knife pall@@ id@@ otomy is as effective as radiofrequency pall@@ id@@ otomy in controlling certain of the symptoms of parkin@@ son &apos;s dise@@ as@@ e. it may be the only practical technique available in certain patients , such as those who take anticoagulants , have bleeding di@@ ath@@ eses or serious systemic medical ill@@ ness@@ es@@ . it is a viable option for other patients as well .
neuroleptic malignant syndrome and methyl@@ phen@@ id@@ at@@ e. a 1 @-@ year @-@ old female presented with neuroleptic malignant syndrome probably caused by methyl@@ phen@@ id@@ at@@ e. she had defects in the supratentorial brain including the basal ganglia and the striatum ( multic@@ ystic encephal@@ omalacia ) due to severe perinatal hypoxic @-@ ischemic encephalopathy , which was considered to be a possible predisposing factor causing neuroleptic malignant syn@@ dro@@ me@@ . a dopaminergic blockade mechanism generally is accepted as the pathogenesis of this syn@@ dro@@ me@@ . however , methylphenidate is a dopamine agonist via the inhibition of uptake of dopamine , and therefore dopaminergic systems in the brainstem ( mainly the midbrain ) and the spinal cord were unlikely to participate in the onset of this syn@@ dro@@ me@@ . a relative gamma @-@ aminobutyric acid @-@ ergic deficiency might occur because diazepam , a gamma @-@ aminobutyric acid @-@ mimetic agent , was strikingly effec@@ ti@@ ve@@ . this is the first reported patient with neuroleptic malignant syndrome probably caused by methylphenidate .
differential effects of 17@@ alpha @-@ eth@@ in@@ yle@@ stradiol on the neutral and acidic pathways of bile salt synthesis in the rat@@ . effects of 17@@ alpha @-@ eth@@ in@@ yle@@ stradiol ( ee ) on the neutral and acidic biosynthetic pathways of bile salt ( bs ) synthesis were evaluated in rats with an intact entero@@ hepatic circulation and in rats with long @-@ term bile diversion to induce bs synthesi@@ s. for this purpose , bile salt pool composition , synthesis of individual bs in vivo , hepatic activities , and expression levels of cholesterol 7@@ alpha @-@ hydroxylase ( cyp@@ 7a ) , and sterol 27 @-@ hydroxylase ( cyp@@ 27 ) , as well as of other enzymes involved in bs synthesis , were analyzed in rats treated with ee ( 5 mg / kg , 3 days ) or its veh@@ ic@@ le@@ . bs pool size was decreased by 27 % but total bs synthesis was not affected by ee in intact rat@@ s. synthesis of cholate was reduced by 68 % in ee @-@ treated rats , while that of ch@@ eno@@ deoxycholate was increased by 60 % . the recently identified delta@@ 22 @-@ isomer of beta @-@ mur@@ ich@@ olate contributed for 5.4 % and 18.3 % ( p &lt; 0.01 ) to the pool in control and ee @-@ treated rats , respectively , but could not be detected in bile after exhaustion of the po@@ ol@@ . a clear reduction of bs synthesis was found in bile @-@ diver@@ ted rats treated with ee , yet biliary bs composition was only minimally aff@@ ec@@ te@@ d. activity of cyp@@ 7a was decreased by ee in both intact and bile @-@ diver@@ ted rats , whereas the activity of the cyp@@ 27 was not aff@@ ec@@ te@@ d. hepatic m@@ r@@ na levels of cyp@@ 7a were significantly reduced by ee in bile @-@ diver@@ ted rats only ; cyp@@ 27 m@@ r@@ na levels were not affected by e@@ e. in addition , m@@ r@@ na levels of sterol 12@@ alpha @-@ hydroxylase and litho@@ cholate 6@@ beta @-@ hydroxylase were increased by bile diversion and suppressed by e@@ e. this study shows that 17@@ alpha @-@ eth@@ in@@ yle@@ stradiol ( ee ) -induced intrahepatic cholestasis in rats is associated with selective inhibition of the neutral pathway of bile salt ( bs ) synthesi@@ s. simultaneous impairment of other enzymes in the bs biosynthetic pathways may contribute to overall effects of ee on bs synthesis .
glibenclamide @-@ sensitive hypotension produced by hel@@ oder@@ min assessed in the rat@@ . the effects of hel@@ oder@@ min , a basic 35 @-@ amino acid peptide isolated from the venom of a lizard salivary gland , on arterial blood pressure and heart rate were examined in the rat , focusing on the possibility that activation of at@@ p sensitive k + ( k ( at@@ p ) ) channels is involved in the respon@@ ses@@ . the results were also compared with those of vasoactive intestinal polypeptide ( vi@@ p ) . hel@@ oder@@ min produced hypotension in a dose @-@ dependent manner with approximately similar potency and duration to vi@@ p. hypotension induced by both peptides was significantly attenuated by glibenclamide , which abolished a lev@@ cro@@ ma@@ kal@@ im @-@ produced decrease in arterial blood pres@@ su@@ re@@ . oxy@@ hemoglobin did not affect hel@@ oder@@ min @-@ induced hypotension , whereas it shortened the duration of acetylcholine ( ach ) -@@ produced hypot@@ en@@ sion@@ . these findings suggest that hel@@ oder@@ min @-@ produced hypotension is partly attributable to the activation of glibenclamide @-@ sensitive k + channels ( k ( at@@ p ) channels ) , which presumably exist on arterial smooth muscle cell@@ s. ed@@ r@@ f ( endothelium @-@ derived relaxing factor ) / nitric oxide does not seem to play an important role in the peptide @-@ produced hypotension .
long @-@ term efficacy and adverse event of nifedipine sustained @-@ release tablets for cyclosporin a @-@ induced hypertension in patients with psori@@ asi@@ s. thirteen psoriatic patients with hypertension during the course of cyclosporin a therapy were treated for 25 months with a calcium channel blocker , sustained @-@ release nifedipine , to study the clinical antihypertensive effects and adverse events during treatment with both dru@@ g@@ s. seven of the 13 patients had exhibited a subclinical hypertensive state before cyclosporin a therap@@ y@@ . both systolic and diastolic blood pressures of these 13 patients were decreased significantly after 4 weeks of nifedipine therapy , and blood pressure was maintained within the normal range thereafter for 25 mon@@ th@@ s. the adverse events during combined therapy with cyclosporin a and nifedipine included an increase in blood urea nitrogen levels in 9 of the 13 patients and development of gingival hyperplasia in 2 of the 13 patient@@ s. our findings indicate that sustained @-@ release nifedipine is useful for hypertensive psoriatic patients under long @-@ term treatment with cyclosporin a , but that these patients should be monitored for gingival hyperplasia .

phase 2 early after@@ depolarization as a trigger of polymorphic ventricular tachycardia in acquired long @-@ q@@ t syndrome : direct evidence from intracellular recordings in the intact left ventricular w@@ all@@ . background : this study examined the role of phase 2 early after@@ depolarization ( e@@ ad ) in producing a trigger to initiate tor@@ s@@ ade de point@@ es ( t@@ d@@ p ) with q@@ t prolongation induced by dl @-@ sotalol and az@@ im@@ il@@ ide@@ . the contribution of transmural dispersion of repolarization ( t@@ d@@ r ) to transmural propagation of e@@ ad and the maintenance of t@@ d@@ p was also evalu@@ ated@@ . methods and results : transmembrane action potentials from ep@@ icardium , mid@@ myocardium , and endocardi@@ um were recorded simultaneously , together with a transmural ec@@ g , in arter@@ ially perfused canine and rabbit left ventricular prepar@@ ation@@ s. dl @-@ sotalol preferentially prolonged action potential duration ( ap@@ d ) in m cells dose @-@ dependently ( 1 to 100 micromol / l ) , leading to q@@ t prolongation and an increase in t@@ dr@@ . az@@ im@@ il@@ ide , however , significantly prolonged ap@@ d and q@@ t interval at concentrations from 0.1 to 10 micromol / l but shortened them at 30 micromol / l@@ . unlike dl @-@ sotalol , az@@ im@@ il@@ ide ( &gt; 3 micromol / l ) increased epicardial ap@@ d markedly , causing a diminished t@@ dr@@ . although both dl @-@ sotalol and az@@ im@@ il@@ ide rarely induced e@@ ads in canine left ventricles , they produced frequent e@@ ads in rabbits , in which more pronounced q@@ t prolongation was se@@ en@@ . an increase in t@@ d@@ r by dl @-@ sotalol facilitated transmural propagation of e@@ ads that initiated multiple episodes of spontaneous t@@ d@@ p in 3 of 6 rabbit left ventr@@ ic@@ les@@ . of note , although az@@ im@@ il@@ ide ( 3 to 10 micromol / l ) increased ap@@ d more than dl @-@ sotalol , its e@@ ads often failed to propagate transm@@ urally , probably because of a diminished t@@ dr@@ . conclusions : this study provides the first direct evidence from intracellular action potential recordings that phase 2 e@@ ad can be generated from intact ventricular wall and produce a trigger to initiate the onset of t@@ d@@ p under q@@ t prolongation .
prenatal cocaine exposure and cranial sonographic findings in preterm inf@@ ant@@ s. purpose : prenatal cocaine exposure has been linked with sub@@ ependymal hemorrhage and the formation of cysts that are detectable on cranial sonography in neonates born at ter@@ m. we sought to determine if prenatal cocaine exposure increases the incidence of sub@@ ependymal cysts in preterm inf@@ ant@@ s. methods : we retrospectively reviewed the medical records and cranial son@@ ograms obtained during a 1 @-@ year period on 122 premature ( &lt; 36 weeks of gestation ) inf@@ ant@@ s. infants were categorized into 1 of 2 groups : those exposed to cocaine and those not exposed to coc@@ ain@@ e. infants were assigned to the cocaine @-@ exposed group if there was a maternal history of cocaine abuse during pregnancy or if maternal or neonatal urine toxicology results were positive at the time of deliver@@ y@@ . results : five of the 122 infants were excluded from the study because of insufficient medical and drug hist@@ ori@@ es@@ . the incidence of sub@@ ependymal cysts in the 117 remaining infants was 14 % ( 16 of 117 ) . the incidence of sub@@ ependymal cysts in infants exposed to cocaine prenatally was 44 % ( 8 of 18 ) compared with 8 % ( 8 of 99 ) in the unexposed group ( p &lt; 0.01 ) . conclusions : we found an increased incidence of sub@@ ependymal cyst formation in preterm infants who were exposed to cocaine pren@@ at@@ all@@ y@@ . this result is consistent with results of similar studies in term infants .
thalidomide neuropathy in patients treated for metastatic prostate cancer@@ . we prospectively evaluated thalidomide @-@ induced neuropathy using electro@@ diagnostic studi@@ es@@ . sixty @-@ seven men with metastatic androgen @-@ independent prostate cancer in an open @-@ label trial of oral thalidomide underwent neurologic examinations and nerve conduction studies ( nc@@ s ) prior to and at 3 @-@ month intervals during treat@@ ment@@ . nc@@ s included recording of sensory nerve action potentials ( sn@@ aps ) from median , radial , ulnar , and sural nerv@@ es@@ . sn@@ ap amplitudes for each nerve were expressed as the percentage of its baseline , and the mean of the four was termed the sn@@ ap index@@ . a 40 % decline in the sn@@ ap index was considered clinically signific@@ ant@@ . thalidomide was discontinued in 55 patients for lack of therapeutic respon@@ se@@ . of 67 patients initially enrolled , 24 remained on thalidomide for 3 months , 8 remained at 6 months , and 3 remained at 9 mon@@ th@@ s. six patients developed neuro@@ path@@ y@@ . clinical symptoms and a decline in the sn@@ ap index occurred con@@ curren@@ t@@ ly@@ . older age and cumulative dose were possible contributing factor@@ s. neuropathy may thus be a common complication of thalidomide in older patient@@ s. the sn@@ ap index can be used to monitor peripheral neuropathy , but not for early detection .
overexpression of copper / zinc @-@ superoxide dismutase protects from kanamycin @-@ induced hearing los@@ s. the participation of reactive oxygen species in aminoglycoside @-@ induced ot@@ otoxicity has been deduced from observations that aminoglycoside @-@ iron complexes catalyze the formation of superoxide radicals in vitro and that antioxidants attenuate ot@@ otoxicity in viv@@ o. we therefore hypothesized that overexpression of c@@ u / z@@ n @-@ superoxide dismutase ( h @-@ s@@ od@@ 1 ) should protect transgenic mice from ot@@ otoxic@@ it@@ y@@ . immunocytochemistry confirmed expression of h @-@ s@@ od@@ 1 in inner ear tissues of transgenic c@@ 57@@ b@@ l / 6 @-@ t@@ gn &#91; s@@ od@@ 1 &#93; 3@@ c@@ je mic@@ e. transgenic and non@@ transgenic littermates received kanamycin ( 400 mg / kg body weight / day ) for 10 days beginning on day 10 after birth@@ . auditory thresholds were tested by evoked auditory brain stem responses at 1 month after birth@@ . in non@@ transgenic animals , the threshold in the kanamycin @-@ treated group was 45 @-@ 50 db higher than in saline @-@ injected contro@@ l@@ s. in the transgenic group , kanamycin increased the threshold by only 15 db over the respective contro@@ l@@ s. the effects were similar at 12 and 24 kh@@ z@@ . the protection by overexpression of superoxide dismutase supports the hypothesis that oxidant stress plays a significant role in aminoglycoside @-@ induced ot@@ otoxic@@ it@@ y@@ . the results also suggest transgenic animals as suitable models to investigate the underlying mechanisms and possible strategies for prevention .
prednisone induces anxiety and glial cerebral changes in rat@@ s. objective : to assess whether prednisone ( p@@ d@@ n ) produces anxiety and / or cerebral glial changes in rat@@ s. methods : male w@@ istar rats were studied and 3 groups were formed ( 8 rats per group ) . the moderate @-@ dose group received 5 mg / kg / day p@@ d@@ n released from a subcutaneous impl@@ ant@@ . in the high @-@ dose group , implants containing p@@ d@@ n equivalent to 60 mg / kg / day were appli@@ ed@@ . in the control group implants contained no p@@ dn@@ . anxiety was assessed using an open field and elevated plus @-@ maze dev@@ ic@@ es@@ . the number of cells and cytoplasmic transformation of astrocytes and microglia cells were assessed by immunohistochemical analy@@ ses@@ . results : anxiety was documented in both groups of p@@ d@@ n treated rats compared with contro@@ l@@ s. the magnitude of transformation of the microglia assessed by the number of inter@@ sections was significantly higher in the p@@ d@@ n groups than in controls in the prefrontal cortex ( moderate @-@ dose , 24.1 ; high @-@ dose , 23.6 ; controls 18.7 ; p &lt; 0.01 ) and striatum ( moderate @-@ dose 25.6 ; high @-@ dose 26.3 ; controls 18.9 ; p &lt; 0.01 ) , but not in hippocamp@@ us@@ . the number of stained microglia cells was significantly higher in the p@@ d@@ n treated groups in the prefrontal cortex than in controls ( moderate @-@ dose , 29.1 ; high @-@ dose , 28.4 ; control , 17.7 cells per field ; p &lt; 0.01 ) . stained microglia cells were significantly more numerous striatum and hippocampus in the high @-@ dose group compared to contro@@ l@@ s. conclusion : subacute exposure to p@@ d@@ n induced anxiety and reactivity of micro@@ gli@@ a. the relevance of these features for patients using p@@ d@@ n remains to be elucidated .

hyponatremia and syndrome of inappropriate anti @-@ diuretic hormone reported with the use of vincristine : an over @-@ representation of asi@@ ans ? purpose : this retrospective study used a pharmaceutical company &apos;s global safety database to determine the reporting rate of hyponatremia and / or syndrome of inappropriate secretion of anti @-@ diuretic hormone ( si@@ ad@@ h ) among vincristine @-@ treated patients and to explore the possibility of at @-@ risk population sub@@ grou@@ ps@@ . method : we searched the eli l@@ il@@ ly and company &apos;s computerized adverse event database for all reported cases of hyponatremia and / or si@@ ad@@ h as of 1 nov@@ ember 1999 that had been reported during the use of vin@@ cris@@ ti@@ ne@@ . results : a total of 76 cases of hyponatremia and / or si@@ ad@@ h associated with vincristine use were identi@@ fi@@ ed@@ . the overall reporting rate was estimated to be 1.3 / 100,000 treated patient@@ s. the average age of patients was 35.6 + / - 28.3 years , and 62 % were mal@@ es@@ . approximately 75 % of the patients were receiving treatment for leukemia or lymph@@ om@@ a. among the 39 reports that included information on race , the racial distribution was : 1 black , 3 ca@@ uc@@ asian , and 35 asi@@ an@@ . conclusion : our data suggest that asian patients may be at increased risk of hyponatremia and / or si@@ ad@@ h associated with vincristine use@@ . although the overall reported rate of si@@ ad@@ h associated with vincristine is very low , physicians caring for asian oncology patients should be aware of this potential serious but reversible adverse event .
delayed toxicity of cyclophosphamide on the bladder of d@@ ba / 2 and c@@ 57@@ b@@ l / 6 female mo@@ use@@ . the present study describes the delayed development of a severe bladder pathology in a susceptible strain of mice ( d@@ ba / 2 ) but not in a resistant strain ( c@@ 57@@ b@@ l / 6 ) when both were treated with a single 300 mg / kg dose of cyclophosphamide ( cy ) . inbred d@@ ba / 2 and c@@ 57@@ b@@ l / 6 female mice were injected with cy , and the effect of the drug on the bladder was assessed during 100 days by light microscopy using different staining procedures , and after 30 days by conventional electron microscop@@ y@@ . early cy toxicity caused a typical haemorrhagic cystitis in both strains that was completely repaired in about 7 @-@ 10 day@@ s. after 30 days of cy injection ulcer@@ ous and non @-@ ulcer@@ ous forms of chronic cystitis appeared in 86 % of d@@ ba / 2 mice but only in 4 % of c@@ 57@@ b@@ l / 6 mic@@ e. delayed cystitis was characterized by infiltration and transepithelial passage into the lumen of inflammatory cells and by frequent exfoliation of the uroth@@ eli@@ um@@ . mast cells appeared in the connective and muscular layers of the bladder at a much higher number in d@@ ba / 2 mice than in c@@ 57@@ b@@ l / 6 mice or untreated contro@@ l@@ s. electron microscopy disclosed the absence of the typical disco@@ idal vesicles normally present in the cytoplasm of surface cell@@ s. instead , numerous abnormal vesicles containing one or several dark granules were observed in the cytoplasm of cells from all the epithelial lay@@ er@@ s. delayed cystitis still persisted in d@@ ba / 2 mice 100 days after treat@@ ment@@ . these results indicate that delayed toxicity of cy in female d@@ ba / 2 mice causes a bladder pathology that is not observed in c@@ 57@@ b@@ l / 6 mic@@ e. this pathology resembles interstitial cystitis in humans and could perhaps be used as an animal model for studies on the disease .

blood brain barrier in r@@ ight@@ - and left @-@ pa@@ w@@ ed female rats assessed by a new staining method@@ . the asymmetrical breakdown of the blood @-@ brain barrier ( b@@ b@@ b ) was studied in female rat@@ s. paw preference was assessed by a food reaching test@@ . adrenaline @-@ induced hypertension was used to destroy the b@@ b@@ b , which was evaluated using triphenyl@@ tetrazolium ( t@@ t@@ c ) staining of the brain slices just after giving adrenaline for 30 s. in normal rats , the whole brain sections exhibited complete staining with t@@ t@@ c. after adrenaline infusion for 30 s , there were large un@@ stained areas in the left brain in right @-@ pa@@ w@@ ed animals , and vice versa in left @-@ pa@@ w@@ ed anim@@ al@@ s. similar results were obtained in seizure @-@ induced breakdown of b@@ b@@ b@@ . these results were explained by an asymmetric cerebral blood flow depending upon the paw preference in rat@@ s. it was suggested that this new method and the results are consistent with contralateral motor control that may be important in determining the dominant cerebral hemisphere in animals .
carvedilol protects against doxorubicin @-@ induced mitochondrial cardiomy@@ opath@@ y@@ . several cytopathic mechanisms have been suggested to mediate the dose @-@ limiting cumulative and irreversible cardiomyopathy caused by dox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in@@ . recent evidence indicates that oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction are key factors in the pathogenic process@@ . the objective of this investigation was to test the hypothesis that carvedilol , a nonselective beta @-@ adrenergic receptor antagonist with potent antioxidant properties , protects against the cardiac and hepatic mitochondrial bio@@ energetic dysfunction associated with subchronic doxorubicin toxic@@ it@@ y@@ . heart and liver mitochondria were isolated from rats treated for 7 weeks with doxorubicin ( 2 mg / kg sc / week ) , carvedilol ( 1 mg / kg ip / week ) , or the combination of the two dru@@ g@@ s. heart mitochondria isolated from doxorubicin @-@ treated rats exhibited depressed rates for state 3 respiration ( 336 + / - 26 versus 425 + / - 53 nat@@ om o / min / mg protein ) and a lower respiratory control ratio ( r@@ cr ) ( 4.3 + / - 0.6 versus 5.8 + / - 0.4 ) compared with cardiac mitochondria isolated from saline @-@ treated rat@@ s. mitochondrial calcium @-@ loading capacity and the activity of nad@@ h @-@ dehydrogenase were also suppressed in cardiac mitochondria from doxorubicin @-@ treated rat@@ s. doxorubicin treatment also caused a decrease in r@@ cr for liver mitochondria ( 3.9 + / - 0.9 versus 5.6 + / - 0.7 for control rats ) and inhibition of hepatic cytochrome oxidase activ@@ it@@ y@@ . coadministration of carvedilol decreased the extent of cellular vacuol@@ ization in cardiac myocytes and prevented the inhibitory effect of doxorubicin on mitochondrial respiration in both heart and li@@ ver@@ . carvedilol also prevented the decrease in mitochondrial ca ( 2 + ) loading capacity and the inhibition of the respiratory complexes of heart mitochondria caused by dox@@ or@@ ub@@ ic@@ in@@ . carvedilol by itself did not affect any of the parameters measured for heart or liver mitochondri@@ a. it is concluded that this protection by carvedilol against both the structural and functional cardiac tissue damage may afford significant clinical advantage in minimizing the dose @-@ limiting mitochondrial dysfunction and cardiomyopathy that accompanies long @-@ term doxorubicin therapy in cancer patients .
cocaine @-@ induced hyperactivity is more influenced by adenosine receptor agonists than amphetamine @-@ induced hyper@@ activ@@ it@@ y@@ . the influence of adenosine receptor agonists and antagonists on cocaine @-@ and amphetamine @-@ induced hyperactivity was examined in mic@@ e. all adenosine receptor agonists significantly decreased the locomotor activity in mice , and the effects were dose @-@ depend@@ ent@@ . it seems that adenosine a1 and a2 receptors might be involved in this re@@ action@@ . moreover , all adenosine receptor agonists : 2 @-@ p- ( 2 @-@ carboxy@@ ethyl ) phen@@ ethyl@@ amino @-@ 5 &apos; -@@ n @-@ ethyl@@ carbox@@ amido@@ adenosine ( c@@ gs 2@@ 16@@ 80 ) , a@@ 2a receptor agonist , n@@ 6 @-@ cyclopent@@ yl@@ adenosine ( c@@ pa ) , a1 receptor agonist , and 5 &apos; -@@ n @-@ ethyl@@ carbox@@ amido@@ adenosine ( nec@@ a ) , a2 / a1 receptor agonist significantly and dose @-@ dependently decreased cocaine @-@ induced locomotor activ@@ it@@ y@@ . c@@ pa reduced cocaine action at the doses which , given alone , did not influence motility , while c@@ gs 2@@ 16@@ 80 and nec@@ a decreased the action of cocaine at the doses which , given alone , decreased locomotor activity in anim@@ al@@ s. these results suggest the involvement of both adenosine receptors in the action of cocaine although agonists of a1 receptors seem to have stronger influence on it@@ . the selective blockade of a2 adenosine receptor by d@@ mp@@ x ( 3,@@ 7 @-@ dimethyl @-@ 1 @-@ pro@@ parg@@ yl@@ xanthine ) significantly enhanced cocaine @-@ induced locomotor activity of anim@@ al@@ s. caffeine had similar action but the effect was not signific@@ ant@@ . c@@ pt ( 8 @-@ cyclopent@@ yl@@ theophylline ) --@@ a1 receptor antagonist , did not show any influence in this test@@ . similarly , all adenosine receptor agonists decreased amphetamine @-@ induced hyperactivity , but at the higher doses than those which were active in cocaine @-@ induced hyper@@ activ@@ it@@ y@@ . the selective blockade of a2 adenosine receptors ( d@@ mp@@ x ) and non @-@ selective blockade of adenosine receptors ( caffeine ) significantly increased the action of amphetamine in the locomotor activity test@@ . our results have shown that all adenosine receptor agonists ( a1 and a2 ) reduce coc@@ ain@@ e- and amphetamine @-@ induced locomotor activity and indicate that cocaine @-@ induced hyperactivity is more influenced by adenosine receptor agonists ( particularly a1 receptors ) than amphetamine @-@ induced hyperactivity .

indomethacin @-@ induced morphologic changes in the rat urinary bladder epitheli@@ um@@ . objectives : to evaluate the morphologic changes in rat uroth@@ elium induced by in@@ dometh@@ acin@@ . nonsteroidal anti @-@ inflammatory drug @-@ induced cystitis is a poorly recognized and under @-@ reported condi@@ tion@@ . in addition to ti@@ a@@ prof@@ enic acid , indomethacin has been reported to be associated with this condi@@ tion@@ . methods : three groups were established : a control group ( n = 10 ) , a high @-@ dose group ( n = 10 ) , treated with one intraperitoneal injection of indomethacin 20 mg / kg , and a therapeutic dose group ( n = 10 ) in which oral indomethacin was administered 3.25 mg / kg body weight daily for 3 week@@ s. the animals were then killed and the bladders removed for light and electron microscopic studi@@ es@@ . results : the light microscopic findings showed some focal epithelial degeneration that was more prominent in the high @-@ dose grou@@ p. when compared with the control group , both indomethacin groups revealed statistically increased numbers of mast cells in the mucosa ( p &lt; 0.0001 ) and penetration of lanth@@ anum nitrate through intercellular areas of the epitheli@@ um@@ . furthermore , the difference in mast cell counts between the high and therapeutic dose groups was also statistically significant ( p &lt; 0.0001 ) . conclusions : indomethacin resulted in histopathologic findings typical of interstitial cystitis , such as leak@@ y bladder epithelium and mucosal mast@@ ocyt@@ osi@@ s. the true incidence of nonsteroidal anti @-@ inflammatory drug @-@ induced cystitis in humans must be clarified by prospective clinical trials .
an open @-@ label phase ii study of low @-@ dose thalidomide in androgen @-@ independent prostate cancer@@ . the antiangiogenic effects of thalidomide have been assessed in clinical trials in patients with various solid and haematological malign@@ anc@@ i@@ es@@ . thalidomide blocks the activity of angiogenic agents including b@@ f@@ g@@ f , veg@@ f and il @-@ 6@@ . we undertook an open @-@ label study using thalidomide 100 mg once daily for up to 6 months in 20 men with androgen @-@ independent prostate cancer@@ . the mean time of study was 109 days ( median 107 , range 4 @-@ 184 days ) . patients underwent regular measurement of prostate @-@ specific antigen ( ps@@ a ) , urea and electrolytes , serum b@@ f@@ g@@ f and veg@@ f@@ . three men ( 15 % ) showed a decline in serum ps@@ a of at least 50 % , sustained throughout treat@@ ment@@ . of 16 men treated for at least 2 months , six ( 37.5 % ) showed a fall in absolute ps@@ a by a median of 48 % . increasing levels of serum b@@ f@@ g@@ f and veg@@ f were associated with progressive disease ; five of six men who demonstrated a fall in ps@@ a also showed a decline in b@@ f@@ g@@ f and veg@@ f levels , and three of four men with a rising ps@@ a showed an increase in both growth factor@@ s. adverse effects included constipation , morning drow@@ siness , dizziness and rash , and resulted in withdrawal from the study by three men@@ . evidence of peripheral sensory neuropathy was found in nine of 13 men before treat@@ ment@@ . in the seven men who completed six months on thalidomide , subclinical evidence of peripheral neuropathy was found in four before treatment , but in all seven at repeat tes@@ tin@@ g. the findings indicate that thalidomide may be an option for patients who have failed other forms of therapy , provided close follow @-@ up is maintained for development of peripheral neuropathy .
central nervous system toxicity following the administration of lev@@ ob@@ up@@ ivacaine for lumbar plexus block : a report of two cas@@ es@@ . background and objectives : central nervous system and cardiac toxicity following the administration of local anesthetics is a recognized complication of regional anesthesi@@ a. lev@@ ob@@ up@@ ivacaine , the pure s ( - ) enantiomer of bupivacaine , was developed to improve the cardiac safety profile of bup@@ ivac@@ ain@@ e. we describe 2 cases of gr@@ and mal seizures following accidental intravascular injection of lev@@ ob@@ up@@ ivac@@ ain@@ e. case report : two patients presenting for elective orthopedic surgery of the lower limb underwent blockade of the lumbar plexus via the posterior appro@@ ach@@ . immediately after the administration of lev@@ ob@@ up@@ ivacaine 0.5 % with epinephrine 2.5 microgram / ml , the patients developed gr@@ and mal seizures , despite negative aspiration for blood and no clinical signs of intravenous epinephrine administr@@ ation@@ . the seizures were successfully treated with sodium thiopental in addition to succin@@ ylcholine in 1 patient@@ . neither patient developed signs of cardiovascular toxic@@ it@@ y@@ . both patients were treated preoperatively with beta @-@ adrenergic antagonist medications , which may have masked the cardiovascular signs of the unintentional intravascular administration of lev@@ ob@@ up@@ ivacaine with ep@@ in@@ eph@@ r@@ ine@@ . conclusions : although lev@@ ob@@ up@@ ivacaine may have a safer cardiac toxicity profile than racemic bupivacaine , if adequate amounts of lev@@ ob@@ up@@ ivacaine reach the circulation , it will result in convul@@ sion@@ s. plasma concentrations sufficient to result in central nervous system toxicity did not produce manifestations of cardiac toxicity in these 2 patients .
anaesthetic complications associated with myot@@ onia congenit@@ a : case study and comparison with other myotonic dis@@ or@@ der@@ s. myot@@ onia congenit@@ a ( m@@ c ) is caused by a defect in the skeletal muscle chloride channel function , which may cause sustained membrane depolar@@ is@@ ation@@ . we describe a previously healthy 32 @-@ year @-@ old woman who developed a life @-@ threatening muscle spasm and secondary ventilation difficulties following a preoperative injection of su@@ x@@ am@@ eth@@ oni@@ um@@ . the muscle spasms disappeared spontaneously and the surgery proceeded without further probl@@ em@@ s. when subsequently questioned , she reported minor symptoms suggesting a myotonic condi@@ tion@@ . myot@@ onia was found on clinical examination and em@@ g. the diagnosis m@@ c was confirmed gene@@ tic@@ all@@ y@@ . neither the patient nor the anaesthe@@ tist were aware of the diagnosis before this potentially lethal complication occur@@ red@@ . we give a brief overview of ion channel disorders including malignant hyperthermia and their anaesthetic considerations .
respiratory pattern in a rat model of epilep@@ sy@@ . purpose : apnea is known to occur during seizures , but systematic studies of ictal respiratory changes in adults are fe@@ w. data regarding respiratory pattern defects during interictal periods also are scarc@@ e. here we sought to generate information with regard to the interictal period in animals with pilocarpine @-@ induced epilep@@ sy@@ . methods : twelve rats ( six chronically epileptic animals and six controls ) were anesthetized , given trache@@ otomies , and subjected to hyperventilation or hypo@@ ventilation condi@@ tion@@ s. breathing movements caused changes in thoracic volume and forced air to flow tid@@ ally through a pneum@@ ot@@ ach@@ ograph@@ . this flow was measured by using a differential pressure transducer , passed through a poly@@ graph , and from this to a computer with custom software that derived ventilation ( ve ) , tidal volume ( v@@ t ) , inspiratory time ( ti ) , expiratory time ( te ) , breathing frequency ( f ) , and mean inspiratory flow ( v@@ t / ti ) on a breath @-@ by @-@ breath basi@@ s. results : the hyperventilation maneuver caused a decrease in spontaneous ventilation in pilocarpine @-@ treated and control rat@@ s. although ve had a similar decrease in both groups , in the epileptic group , the decrease in ve was due to a significant ( p &lt; 0.05 ) increase in te peak in relation to that of the control anim@@ al@@ s. the hypo@@ ventilation maneuver led to an increase in the arterial pac@@ o@@ 2 , followed by an increase in ve@@ . in the epileptic group , the increase in ve was mediated by a significant ( p &lt; 0.05 ) decrease in te peak compared with the control grou@@ p. systemic application of k@@ c@@ n , to evaluate the effects of peripheral chemo@@ reception activation on ventilation , led to a similar increase in ve for both grou@@ ps@@ . conclusions : the data indicate that pilocarpine @-@ treated animals have an altered ability to react to ( or compensate for ) blood gas changes with changes in ventilation and suggest that it is centrally determin@@ ed@@ . we speculate on the possible relation of the current findings on treating different epilepsy @-@ associated conditions .
increased serum soluble f@@ as in patients with acute liver failure due to paracetamol over@@ dos@@ e. background / aims : experimental studies have suggested that apoptosis via the f@@ as / f@@ as ligand signaling system may play an important role in the development of acute liver fail@@ ure@@ . the aim of the study was to investigate the soluble form of f@@ as in patients with acute liver fail@@ ure@@ . methodology : serum levels of s@@ f@@ as ( soluble f@@ as ) were measured by el@@ is@@ a in 24 patients with acute liver failure and 10 normal control subjec@@ ts@@ . serum levels of tumor necrosis factor @-@ alpha and interferon @-@ gamma were also determined by el@@ is@@ a. results : serum s@@ f@@ as was significantly increased in patients with acute liver failure ( median , 26.8 u / ml ; range , 6.9 @-@ 5@@ 2.7 u / ml ) compared to the normal controls ( median , 8.6 u / ml ; range , 6.5 @-@ 12.0 u / ml , p &lt; 0.0001 ) . levels were significantly greater in patients with acute liver failure due to paracetamol overdose ( median , 28.7 u / ml ; range , 12.8 @-@ 5@@ 2.7 u / ml , n = 17 ) than those due to non @-@ a to e hepatitis ( median , 12.5 u / ml ; range , 6.9 @-@ 4@@ 6.0 u / ml , n = 7 , p &lt; 0.01 ) . there was no relationship of s@@ f@@ as to eventual outcome in the patient@@ s. a significant correlation was observed between serum s@@ f@@ as levels and aspartate aminotransferase ( r = 0.6@@ 13 , p &lt; 0.01 ) . conclusions : the increased concentration of s@@ f@@ as in serum of patients with acute liver failure may reflect activation of f@@ as @-@ mediated apoptosis in the liver and this together with increased tumor necrosis factor @-@ alpha may be an important factor in liver cell loss .
bilateral subthalamic nucleus stimulation for parkin@@ son &apos;s dise@@ as@@ e. high frequency stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus ( st@@ n ) is known to ameliorate the signs and symptoms of advanced parkin@@ son &apos;s dise@@ as@@ e. aim : we studied the effect of high frequency st@@ n stimulation in 23 patient@@ s. method : twenty @-@ three patients suffering from severe parkin@@ son &apos;s disease ( stages iii @-@ v on ho@@ e@@ hn and y@@ a@@ hr scale ) and , particularly brady@@ kinesia , rigidity , and levodopa @-@ induced dys@@ kine@@ sias underwent bilateral implantation of electrodes in the st@@ n@@ . preoperative and postoperative assessments of these patients at 1 , 3 , 6 and 12 months follow @-@ up , in &quot; on &quot; and &quot; off &quot; drug conditions , was carried out using unified parkin@@ son &apos;s disease rating scale , ho@@ e@@ hn and y@@ a@@ hr staging , en@@ gland activities of daily living score and video recor@@ d@@ ing@@ s. results : after one year of electrical stimulation of the st@@ n , the patients &apos; scores for activities of daily living and motor examination scores ( unified parkin@@ son &apos;s disease rating scale parts ii and iii ) off medication improved by 62 % and 61 % respectively ( p &lt; 0.0005 ) . the sub@@ scores for the a@@ kinesia , rigidity , tremor and gait also improved .

ocular motility changes after sub@@ ten@@ on carboplatin chemotherapy for retin@@ obl@@ astom@@ a. background : focal sub@@ ten@@ on carboplatin injections have recently been used as a presumably toxicity @-@ free adjunct to systemic chemotherapy for intraocular retin@@ obl@@ astom@@ a. objective : to report our clinical experience with abnormal ocular motility in patients treated with sub@@ ten@@ on carboplatin chemo@@ therap@@ y@@ . methods : we noted abnormal ocular motility in 10 consecutive patients with retinoblastoma who had received sub@@ ten@@ on carbo@@ pl@@ atin@@ . during ocular manipulation under general anesthesia , we assessed their eyes by forced duction testing , comparing ocular motility after tumor control with ocular motility at diag@@ no@@ si@@ s. eyes subsequently enucleated because of treatment failure ( n = 4 ) were examined hist@@ olog@@ ic@@ all@@ y@@ . results : limitation of ocular motility was detected in all 12 eyes of 10 patients treated for intraocular retinoblastoma with 1 to 6 injections of sub@@ ten@@ on carboplatin as part of multimodality therap@@ y@@ . histopathological examination revealed many lipo@@ phages in the peri@@ orbital fat surrounding the optic nerve in 1 eye , indicative of phagocytosis of previously existing fat cells and suggesting prior fat necro@@ si@@ s. the enucle@@ ations were technically difficult and hazardous for globe rupture because of extensive orbital soft tissue adhe@@ sion@@ s. conclusions : sub@@ ten@@ on carboplatin chemotherapy is associated with significant fibrosis of orbital soft tissues , leading to mechanical restriction of eye movements and making subsequent enucleation difficul@@ t. sub@@ ten@@ on carboplatin is not free of toxicity , and its use is best restricted to specific indications .
eth@@ am@@ but@@ ol and optic neuro@@ path@@ y@@ . purpose : to demonstrate the association between eth@@ am@@ but@@ ol and optic neuro@@ path@@ y@@ . method : thirteen patients who developed optic neuropathy after being treated with eth@@ am@@ but@@ ol for tuberculosis of the lung or lymph node at sir@@ ir@@ a@@ j hospital between 1997 and 2001 were retrospectively revie@@ wed@@ . the clinical characteristics and initial and final visual acuity were analyzed to determine visual outcom@@ e. results : all patients had optic neuropathy between 1 to 6 months ( mean = 2.9 months ) after starting eth@@ am@@ but@@ ol therapy at a dosage ranging from 13 to 20 mg / kg / day ( mean = 17 mg / kg / day ) . seven ( 54 % ) of the 13 patients experienced visual recovery after stopping the dru@@ g. of 6 patients with irreversible visual impairment , 4 patients had diabetes mellitus , glaucoma and a history of heavy smo@@ k@@ ing@@ . conclusion : early recognition of optic neuropathy should be considered in patients with eth@@ am@@ but@@ ol therap@@ y@@ . a low dose and prompt discontinuation of the drug is recommended particularly in individuals with diabetes mellitus , glaucoma or who are heavy smokers .
treatment of compensatory gustatory hyper@@ hidrosis with topical glyc@@ opyr@@ ro@@ lat@@ e. gustatory hyper@@ hidrosis is facial sweating usually associated with the eating of hot spic@@ y food or even sm@@ elling this food@@ . current options of treatment include oral anticholinergic drugs , the topical application of anti@@ cholin@@ erg@@ ics or aluminum chloride , and the injection of botulinum tox@@ in@@ . thirteen patients have been treated to date with 1.5 % or 2 % topical glyc@@ opyr@@ ro@@ lat@@ e. all patients had gustatory hyper@@ hidrosis , which interfered with their social activities , after trans@@ thro@@ acic endoscopic sympathectomy , and which was associated with compensatory focal hyper@@ hid@@ rosi@@ s. after applying topical glyc@@ opyr@@ ro@@ late , the subjective effect was excellent ( no sweating after eating hot spic@@ y food ) in 10 patients ( 77 % ) , and fair ( clearly reduced sweating ) in 3 patients ( 23 % ) . all had reported incidents of being very emb@@ arr@@ assed whilst eating hot spic@@ y food@@ s. adverse effects included a mildly dry mouth and a sore throat in 2 patients ( 2 % glyc@@ opyr@@ ro@@ late ) , a light headache in 1 patient ( 1.5 % glyc@@ opyr@@ ro@@ late ) . the topical application of a glyc@@ opyr@@ ro@@ late pad appeared to be safe , efficacious , well tolerated , and a convenient method of treatment for moderate to severe symptoms of gustatory hyper@@ hidrosis in post transthoracic endoscopic sympathectomy or sympath@@ ic@@ otomy patients , with few side effects .
pharmacological characteristics and side effects of a new gal@@ enic formulation of propofol without soy@@ ab@@ ean o@@ il@@ . we compared the pharmacokinetics , pharmacodynamics and safety profile of a new gal@@ enic formulation of propofol ( am@@ 149 1 % ) , which does not contain soy@@ ab@@ ean oil , with a standard formulation of propofol ( dis@@ op@@ ri@@ van 1 % ) . in a randomised , double @-@ blind , cross @-@ over study , 30 healthy volunteers received a single intravenous bolus injection of 2.5 mg.kg @-@ 1 propo@@ fol@@ . plasma propofol levels were measured for 48 h following drug administration and evaluated according to a three @-@ compartment mod@@ el@@ . the pharmacodynamic parameters assessed included induction and emergence times , respiratory and cardiovascular effects , and pain on injec@@ tion@@ . patients were monitored for side effects over 48 h@@ . owing to a high incidence of thromb@@ oph@@ le@@ bitis , the study was terminated prematurely and only the data of the two parallel treatment groups ( 15 patients in each group ) were analy@@ sed@@ . plasma concentrations did not differ significantly between the two form@@ ul@@ ation@@ s. anaesthesia induction and emergence times , respiratory and cardiovascular variables showed no significant differences between the two treatment grou@@ ps@@ . pain on injection ( 80 vs. 20 % , p &lt; 0.01 ) and thromb@@ oph@@ le@@ bitis ( 93.3 vs. 6.6 % , p &lt; 0.001 ) occurred more frequently with am@@ 149 than with dis@@ op@@ ri@@ van@@ . although both formulations had similar pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles the new formulation is not suitable for clinical use due to the high incidence of thromb@@ oph@@ le@@ bitis produced .
vin@@ orel@@ bine @-@ related cardiac events : a meta @-@ analysis of randomized clinical tri@@ al@@ s. several cases of cardiac adverse reactions related to vin@@ orel@@ bine ( v@@ n@@ r ) have been reported in the liter@@ at@@ ure@@ . in order to quantify the incidence of these cardiac events , we performed a meta @-@ analysis of clinical trials comparing v@@ n@@ r with other chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of various malign@@ anc@@ i@@ es@@ . randomized clinical trials comparing v@@ n@@ r with other drugs in the treatment of cancer were searched in med@@ line , emb@@ ase , evidence @-@ based medicine reviews databases and the co@@ ch@@ rane library from 1987 to 200@@ 2. outcomes of interest were severe cardiac events , toxic deaths and cardiac event @-@ related deaths reported in each public@@ ation@@ . we found 19 trials , involving 24@@ 41 patients treated by v@@ n@@ r and 20@@ 50 control patient@@ s. the incidence of cardiac events with v@@ n@@ r was 1.19 % &#91; 95 % confidence interval ( ci ) ( 0.75 ; 1.67 ) &#93; . there was no difference in the risk of cardiac events between v@@ n@@ r and other drugs &#91; odds ratio : 0.92 , 95 % ci ( 0.54 ; 1.55 ) &#93; . the risk of v@@ n@@ r cardiac events was similar to vin@@ des@@ ine ( v@@ ds ) and other cardi@@ otoxic drugs &#91; fluorouracil , anthracyclines , gemcitabine ( ge@@ m ) em leader &#93; . even if it did not reach statistical significance because of a few number of cases , the risk was lower in trials excluding patients with cardiac history , and seemed to be higher in trials including patients with pre @-@ existing cardiac dise@@ as@@ es@@ . vin@@ orel@@ bine @-@ related cardiac events concern about 1 % of treated patients in clinical tri@@ al@@ s. however , the risk associated with v@@ n@@ r seems to be similar to that of other chemotherapeutic agents in the same indications .

the natural history of vig@@ ab@@ atr@@ in associated visual field defects in patients elec@@ ting to continue their medic@@ ation@@ . purpose : to determine the natural history of visual field defects in a group of patients known to have vig@@ ab@@ atr@@ in @-@ associated changes who elected to continue the medication because of good seizure contro@@ l@@ . methods : all patients taking vig@@ ab@@ atr@@ in alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs for at least 5 years ( range 5 @-@ 12 years ) were entered into a visual surveillance program@@ me@@ . patients were followed up at 6 @-@ monthly intervals for not less than 18 months ( range 18 @-@ 43 months ) . in all , 16 patients with unequivocal defects continued the medic@@ ation@@ . following already published methodology ( eye 2002 ; 16 ; 5@@ 67 @-@ 571 ) monocular mean radial degrees ( m@@ r@@ ds ) to the i / 4@@ e isop@@ ter on gold@@ mann perimetry was calculated for the right eye at the time of discovery of a visual field defect and again after not less than 18 months follow @-@ up@@ . results : mean right eye m@@ rd at presentation was 36.@@ 98 degrees ( range 22.@@ 25 @-@ 5@@ 1.0 ) , compared to 38.@@ 40 degrees ( range 22.5 @-@ 49.@@ 75 ) after follow @-@ up ; p = 0.3@@ 38 unpaired t @-@ test@@ . only one patient demonstrated a deterioration in visual field during the study period and discontinued treat@@ ment@@ . conclusion : established visual field defects presumed to be due to vig@@ ab@@ atr@@ in therapy did not usually progress in spite of continuing use of the medic@@ ation@@ . these data give support to the hypothesis that the pathogenesis of vig@@ ab@@ atr@@ in @-@ associated visual field defects may be an idi@@ osyn@@ cr@@ atic adverse drug reaction rather than dose @-@ dependent toxicity .
induction of ros@@ ace@@ iform dermatitis during treatment of facial inflammatory dermatoses with tacrolimus oint@@ ment@@ . background : tacrolimus ointment is increasingly used for anti @-@ inflammatory treatment of sensitive areas such as the face , and recent observations indicate that the treatment is effective in steroid @-@ aggravated ros@@ acea and peri@@ oral derm@@ ati@@ tis@@ . we report on ros@@ ace@@ iform dermatitis as a complication of treatment with tacrolimus oint@@ ment@@ . observations : six adult patients with inflammatory facial dermatoses were treated with tacrolimus ointment because of the in@@ effectiveness of standard treat@@ ment@@ s. within 2 to 3 weeks of initially effective and well @-@ tolerated treatment , 3 patients with a history of ros@@ acea and 1 with a history of acne experienced sudden worsening with pust@@ ular ros@@ ace@@ iform le@@ sion@@ s. biopsy revealed an abundance of de@@ mo@@ dex mites in 2 of these patient@@ s. in 1 patient with eyelid eczema , ros@@ ace@@ iform peri@@ ocular dermatitis gradually appeared after 3 weeks of treat@@ ment@@ . in 1 patient with atopic dermatitis , telangi@@ ect@@ atic and pap@@ ular ros@@ acea insi@@ di@@ ously appeared after 5 months of treat@@ ment@@ . conclusions : our observations suggest that the spectrum of ros@@ ace@@ iform dermatitis as a complication of treatment with tacrolimus ointment is heterogene@@ ous@@ . a variety of factors , such as vasoactive properties of tacrolimus , proliferation of de@@ mo@@ dex due to local immunosuppression , and the occlusive properties of the ointment , may be involved in the observed phenomen@@ a. future studies are needed to identify individual risk factors .
structural abnormalities in the brains of human subjects who use meth@@ amph@@ et@@ amin@@ e. we visualize , for the first time , the profile of structural deficits in the human brain associated with chronic methamphetamine ( ma ) ab@@ use@@ . studies of human subjects who have used ma chronically have revealed deficits in dopaminergic and serotonergic systems and cerebral metabolic abnormal@@ iti@@ es@@ . using magnetic resonance imaging ( m@@ ri ) and new computational brain @-@ mapping techniques , we determined the pattern of structural brain alterations associated with chronic ma abuse in human subjects and related these deficits to cognitive impair@@ ment@@ . we used high @-@ resolution m@@ ri and surface @-@ based computational image analyses to map regional abnormalities in the cortex , hippocampus , white matter , and ventricles in 22 human subjects who used ma and 21 age @-@ matched , healthy contro@@ l@@ s. cortical maps revealed severe gray @-@ matter deficits in the cingulate , limbic , and par@@ alim@@ bic cortices of ma abusers ( averaging 11.3 % below control ; p &lt; 0.05 ) . on average , ma abusers had 7.8 % smaller hippocampal volumes than control subjects ( p &lt; 0.01 ; left , p = 0.01 ; right , p &lt; 0.05 ) and significant white @-@ matter hypertrophy ( 7.0 % ; p &lt; 0.01 ) . hippocampal deficits were mapped and correlated with memory performance on a word @-@ recall test ( p &lt; 0.05 ) . m@@ ri @-@ based maps suggest that chronic methamphetamine abuse causes a selective pattern of cerebral deterioration that contributes to impaired memory perform@@ anc@@ e. ma may selectively damage the medial temporal lobe and , consistent with metabolic studies , the cingulate @-@ limbic cortex , inducing neuro@@ adaptation , neuropil reduction , or cell de@@ ath@@ . prominent white @-@ matter hypertrophy may result from altered myelination and adaptive glial changes , including gliosis secondary to neuronal dam@@ ag@@ e. these brain substrates may help account for the symptoms of ma abuse , providing therapeutic targets for drug @-@ induced brain injury .
disruption of hepatic lipid homeostasis in mice after amiodarone treatment is associated with peroxisome proliferator @-@ activated receptor @-@ alpha target gene activ@@ ation@@ . amiodarone , an efficacious and widely used antiarrhythmic agent , has been reported to cause hepatotoxicity in some patient@@ s. to gain insight into the mechanism of this unwanted effect , mice were administered various doses of amiodarone and examined for changes in hepatic histology and gene regul@@ ation@@ . amiodarone induced hepatomegaly , hepatocyte micro@@ vesicular lipid accumulation , and a significant decrease in serum triglycerides and glucos@@ e. northern blot analysis of hepatic r@@ na revealed a dose @-@ dependent increase in the expression of a number of genes critical for fatty acid oxidation , lipoprotein assembly , and lipid transpor@@ t. many of these genes are regulated by the peroxisome proliferator @-@ activated receptor @-@ alpha ( p@@ par@@ alpha ) , a ligand @-@ activated nuclear hormone receptor transcription factor@@ . the absence of induction of these genes as well as hepatomegaly in p@@ par@@ alpha knockout &#91; p@@ par@@ alpha- / - &#93; mice indicated that the effects of amiodarone were dependent upon the presence of a functional p@@ par@@ alpha gen@@ e. compared to wild @-@ type mice , treatment of p@@ par@@ alpha- / - mice with amiodarone resulted in an increased rate and extent of total body weight los@@ s. the inability of amiodarone to directly activate either human or mouse p@@ par@@ alpha transiently expressed in human hep@@ g@@ 2 hepatoma cells indicates that the effects of amiodarone on the function of this receptor were in@@ direc@@ t. based upon these results , we conclude that amiodarone disrupts hepatic lipid homeostasis and that the increased expression of p@@ par@@ alpha target genes is secondary to this toxic effec@@ t. these results provide important new mechanistic information regarding the hepat@@ otoxic effects of amiodarone and indicate that p@@ par@@ alpha protects against amiodarone @-@ induced hepatotoxicity .

a case of postoperative anxiety due to low dose dro@@ peridol used with patient @-@ controlled analge@@ si@@ a. a multiparous woman in good psychological health underwent urgent caesarean section in lab@@ our@@ . postoperatively , she was given a patient @-@ controlled analgesia device delivering bol@@ uses of di@@ amorph@@ ine 0.5 mg and dro@@ peridol 0.025 m@@ g. whilst using the device she gradually became anxious , the feeling worsening after each bol@@ us@@ . the diagnosis of dro@@ peridol @-@ induced psychological disturbance was not made straight away although on subsequent close questioning the patient gave a very clear histor@@ y@@ . after she had received a total of only 0.9 mg dro@@ peridol , a syringe containing di@@ amorph@@ ine only was substituted and her un@@ ease resolved complet@@ el@@ y@@ . we feel that , although the dramatic extrapyramidal side effects of dopaminergic anti@@ em@@ etics are well known , more subtle manifestations may easily be overlooked .
accurate patient history contributes to differentiating diabetes insipidus : a case stud@@ y@@ . this case study highlights the important contribution of nursing in obtaining an accurate health histor@@ y@@ . the case discussed herein initially appeared to be neurogenic diabetes insipidus ( di ) secondary to a traumatic brain injur@@ y@@ . the nursing staff , by reviewing the patient &apos;s health history with his family , discovered a history of poly@@ dip@@ sia and long @-@ standing lithium use@@ . lithium is implicated in drug @-@ induced nephro@@ genic di , and because the patient had not received lithium since being admitted to the hospital , his treatment changed to focus on nephro@@ genic di@@ . by combining information from the patient history , the physical examination , and radiologic and laboratory studies , the critical care team demonstrated that the patient had been self @-@ treating his lithium @-@ induced nephro@@ genic di and developed neurogenic di secondary to brain traum@@ a. thus successful treatment required that nephro@@ genic and neurogenic di be treated concomitantly .

5 @-@ fluorouracil cardiotoxicity induced by alpha @-@ fluoro @-@ beta @-@ alan@@ ine@@ . cardiotoxicity is a rare complication occurring during 5 @-@ fluorouracil ( 5 @-@ f@@ u ) treatment for malign@@ anc@@ i@@ es@@ . we herein report the case of a 70 @-@ year @-@ old man with 5 @-@ f@@ u @-@ induced cardiotoxicity , in whom a high serum level of alpha @-@ fluoro @-@ beta @-@ alanine ( f@@ bal ) was obser@@ ve@@ d. the patient , who had unresectable colon cancer metastases to the liver and lung , was referred to us for chemotherapy from an affiliated hospital ; he had no cardiac histor@@ y@@ . after admission , the patient received a continuous intravenous infusion of 5 @-@ f@@ u ( 1000 mg / day ) , during which precor@@ dial pain with right bundle branch block occurred concomitantly with a high serum f@@ bal concentration of 19@@ 55 ng / m@@ l@@ . both the precor@@ dial pain and the electrocardiographic changes disappeared spontaneously after the discontinuation of 5 @-@ fu@@ . as the precor@@ dial pain in this patient was considered to have been due to 5 @-@ f@@ u @-@ induced cardiotoxicity , the administration of 5 @-@ f@@ u was aband@@ on@@ ed@@ . instead , oral administration of s @-@ 1 ( a derivative of 5 @-@ f@@ u ) , at 200 mg / day twice a week , was instituted , because s @-@ 1 has a strong inhibitory effect on dihydro@@ pyrimidine dehydrogenase , which catalyzes the degradative of 5 @-@ f@@ u into f@@ bal@@ . the serum f@@ bal concentration subsequently decreased to 352 ng / ml , the same as the value measured on the first day of s @-@ 1 administr@@ ation@@ . thereafter , no cardiac symptoms were obser@@ ve@@ d. the patient achieved a partial response 6 months after the initiation of the s @-@ 1 treat@@ ment@@ . the experience of this case , together with a review of the literature , suggests that f@@ bal is related to 5 @-@ f@@ u @-@ induced cardi@@ otoxic@@ it@@ y@@ . s @-@ 1 may be administered safely to patients with 5 @-@ f@@ u @-@ induced cardiotoxicity .
the influence of the time interval between mono@@ her and doxorubicin administration on the protection against doxorubicin @-@ induced cardiotoxicity in mic@@ e. purpose : despite its well @-@ known cardiotoxicity , the anthrac@@ ycl@@ in doxorubicin ( dox ) continues to be an effective and widely used chemotherapeutic ag@@ ent@@ . dox @-@ induced cardiac damage presumably results from the formation of free radicals by dox@@ . reactive oxygen species particularly affect the cardiac myocytes because these cells seem to have a relatively poor antioxidant defense system@@ . the semis@@ yn@@ thetic flavonoid mono@@ hydroxy@@ ethyl@@ r@@ ut@@ oside ( mono@@ her ) showed cardioprotection against dox @-@ induced cardiotoxicity through its radical scavenging and iron chelating proper@@ ti@@ es@@ . because of the relatively short final half @-@ life of mono@@ her ( about 30 min ) , it is expected that the time interval between mono@@ her and dox might be of influence on the cardioprotective effect of mono@@ her@@ . therefore , the aim of the present study was to investigate this possible effec@@ t. methods : six groups of 6 bal@@ b / c mice were treated with saline , dox alone or dox ( 4 mg / kg i.v. ) preceded by mono@@ her ( 500 mg / kg i.p. ) with an interval of 10 , 30 , 60 or 120 min@@ . after a 6 @-@ week treatment period and additional observation for 2 weeks , the mice were sacrific@@ ed@@ . their cardiac tissues were processed for light microscopy , after which cardiomyocyte damage was evaluated according to b@@ ill@@ ingham ( in cancer treat re@@ p 62 ( 6 ) : 8@@ 65 @-@ 8@@ 72 , 1978 ) . microscopic evaluation revealed that treatment with dox alone induced significant cardiac damage in comparison to the saline control group ( p &lt; 0.001 ) . results : the number of damaged cardiomyocytes was 9.6 @-@ fold ( 95 % ci 4.4 @-@ 21.0 ) higher in mice treated with dox alone than that in animals of the control grou@@ p. the ratio of aberrant cardiomyocytes in mice treated with dox preceded by mono@@ her and those in mice treated with saline ranged from 1.6 to 2.8 ( mean 2.2 , 95 % ci 1.2 @-@ 4.1 , p = 0.019 ) . the mean protective effect by adding mono@@ her before dox led to a significant 4.4 @-@ fold reduction ( p &lt; 0.001 , 95 % ci 2.3 @-@ 8.2 ) of abnormal cardiomy@@ ocyt@@ es@@ . this protective effect did not depend on the time interval between mono@@ her and dox administration ( p = 0.3@@ 45 ) . conclusion : the results indicate that in an outpatient clinical setting mono@@ her may be administered shortly before dox .
clinical evaluation of adverse effects during b@@ epri@@ dil administration for atrial fibrillation and fl@@ utter@@ . background : b@@ epri@@ dil hydrochloride ( bp@@ d ) has attracted attention as an effective drug for atrial fibrillation ( af ) and atrial flutter ( af@@ l ) . however , serious adverse effects , including tor@@ s@@ ade de point@@ es ( t@@ d@@ p ) , have been repor@@ te@@ d. methods and results : adverse effects of bp@@ d requiring discontinuation of treatment were evalu@@ ated@@ . bp@@ d was administered to 4@@ 59 patients ( 361 males , 63 + / -12 years old ) comprising 378 af and 81 af@@ l cas@@ es@@ . mean left ventricular ejection fraction and atrial dimension ( l@@ ad ) were 66 + / -11 % and 40 + / -6 mm , respec@@ ti@@ vel@@ y@@ . adverse effects were observed in 19 patients ( 4 % ) during an average follow @-@ up of 20 mon@@ th@@ s. there was marked q@@ t prolongation greater than 0.55 s in 13 patients , bradycardia less than 40 beats / min in 6 patients , dizziness and general fatigue in 1 patient e@@ ach@@ . in 4 of 13 patients with q@@ t prolongation , t@@ d@@ p occur@@ red@@ . the major triggering factors of t@@ d@@ p were hypokalemia and sudden decrease in heart rat@@ e. there were no differences in the clinical backgrounds of the patients with and without t@@ d@@ p other than l@@ ad and age , which were larger and older in the patients with t@@ d@@ p. conclusion : careful observation of serum potassium concentration and the ec@@ g should always be done during bp@@ d administration , particularly in elderly patients .
enhanced isoproterenol @-@ induced cardiac hypertrophy in transgenic rats with low brain angiotens@@ in@@ ogen@@ . we have previously shown that a permanent deficiency in the brain renin @-@ angiotensin system ( ras ) may increase the sensitivity of the baroreflex control of heart rat@@ e. in this study we aimed at studying the involvement of the brain ras in the cardiac reactivity to the beta @-@ adrenoceptor ( beta @-@ ar ) agonist isoproterenol ( iso ) . transgenic rats with low brain angiotensinogen ( t@@ g@@ r ) were us@@ ed@@ . in isolated hearts , iso induced a significantly greater increase in left ventricular ( l@@ v ) pressure and maximal contraction ( + d@@ p / dt ( max ) ) in the t@@ g@@ r than in the sp@@ rag@@ ue @-@ d@@ aw@@ ley ( sd ) rat@@ s. l@@ v hypertrophy induced by iso treatment was significantly higher in t@@ g@@ r than in sd rats ( in g l@@ v wt / 100 g body wt , 0.28 + / - 0.004 vs. 0.24 + / - 0.004 , respectively ) . the greater l@@ v hypertrophy in t@@ g@@ r rats was associated with more pronounced downregulation of beta @-@ ar and upregulation of l@@ v beta @-@ ar kinase @-@ 1 m@@ r@@ na levels compared with those in sd rat@@ s. the decrease in the heart rate ( hr ) induced by the beta @-@ ar antagonist metoprolol in conscious rats was significantly attenuated in t@@ g@@ r compared with sd rats ( -@@ 9.9 + / - 1.7 % vs. -@@ 18.1 + / - 1.5 % ) , whereas the effect of parasympathetic blockade by atropine on hr was similar in both str@@ ain@@ s. these results indicate that t@@ g@@ r are more sensitive to beta @-@ ar agonist @-@ induced cardiac inotropic response and hypertrophy , possibly due to chronically low sympathetic outflow directed to the heart .
drug @-@ induced long q@@ t syndrome in injection drug users receiving methadone : high frequency in hospitalized patients and risk factor@@ s. background : drug @-@ induced long q@@ t syndrome is a serious adverse drug re@@ action@@ . methadone prolongs the q@@ t interval in vitro in a dose @-@ dependent man@@ ner@@ . in the inpatient setting , the frequency of q@@ t interval prolongation with methadone treatment , its dose dependence , and the importance of cofactors such as drug @-@ drug interactions remain un@@ know@@ n@@ . methods : we performed a systematic , retrospective study comparing active or former intravenous drug users receiving methadone and those not receiving methadone among all patients hospitalized over a 5 @-@ year period in a tertiary care hospit@@ al@@ . a total of 167 patients receiving methadone fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were compared with a control group of 80 injection drug users not receiving meth@@ ad@@ on@@ e. in addition to methadone dose , 15 demographic , biological , and pharmacological variables were considered as potential risk factors for q@@ t prolong@@ ation@@ . results : among 167 methadone maintenance patients , the prevalence of q@@ t@@ c prolongation to 0.50 second ( ( 1 / 2 ) ) or longer was 16.2 % compared with 0 % in 80 control subjec@@ ts@@ . six patients ( 3.6 % ) in the methadone group presented tor@@ s@@ ades de po@@ intes@@ . q@@ t@@ c length was weakly but significantly associated with methadone daily dose ( sp@@ earman rank correlation coefficient , 0.20 ; p &lt; .01 ) . multivariate regression analysis allowed attribution of 31.8 % of q@@ t@@ c variability to methadone dose , cytochrome p @-@ 450 3@@ a@@ 4 drug @-@ drug interactions , hypokalemia , and altered liver function@@ . conclusions : q@@ t interval prolongation in methadone maintenance patients hospitalized in a tertiary care center is a frequent fin@@ d@@ ing@@ . methadone dose , presence of cytochrome p @-@ 450 3@@ a@@ 4 inhibitors , potassium level , and liver function contribute to q@@ t prolong@@ ation@@ . long q@@ t syndrome can occur with low doses of methadone .
mechanisms of hypertension induced by nitric oxide ( no ) deficiency : focus on venous function@@ . loss of endothelial cell @-@ derived nitric oxide ( no ) in hypertension is a hallmark of arterial dys@@ function@@ . experimental hypertension created by the removal of no , however , involves mechanisms in addition to decreased arterial vasodilator activ@@ it@@ y@@ . these include augmented endothelin @-@ 1 ( et @-@ 1 ) release , increased sympathetic nervous system activity , and elevated tissue oxidative stress@@ . we hypothesized that increased venous smooth muscle ( ven@@ omotor ) tone plays a role in n@@ omega @-@ nitro @-@ l @-@ arginine ( l@@ n@@ na ) hypertension through these mechanis@@ m@@ s. rats were treated with the no synthase inhibitor l@@ n@@ na ( 0.5 g / l in drinking water ) for 2 week@@ s. mean arterial pressure of conscious rats was 119 + / - 2 mm h@@ g in control and 194 + / - 5 mm h@@ g in l@@ n@@ na rats ( p &lt; 0.05 ) . carotid arteries and vena cava were removed for measurement of isometric contracti@@ on@@ . maximal contraction to norepinephrine was modestly reduced in arteries from l@@ n@@ na compared with control rats whereas the maximum contraction to et @-@ 1 was significantly reduced ( 54 % control ) . maximum contraction of vena cava to norepinephrine ( 37 % control ) also was reduced but no change in response to et @-@ 1 was obser@@ ve@@ d. mean circulatory filling pressure , an in vivo measure of ven@@ omotor tone , was not elevated in l@@ n@@ na hypertension at 1 or 2 weeks after l@@ n@@ na@@ . the superoxide scavenger tem@@ pol ( 30 , 100 , and 300 micromol kg ( -1 ) , iv ) did not change arterial pressure in control rats but caused a dose @-@ dependent decrease in l@@ n@@ na rats ( -18 + / - 8 , -@@ 26 + / - 15 , and -@@ 54 + / - 11 mm h@@ g ) . similarly , ganglionic blockade with hexam@@ ethonium caused a significantly greater fall in l@@ n@@ na hypertensive rats ( 76 + / - 9 mm h@@ g ) compared with control rats ( 35 + / - 10 mm h@@ g ) . carotid arteries , vena cava , and sympathetic ganglia from l@@ n@@ na rats had higher basal levels of superoxide compared with those from control rat@@ s. these data suggest that while no deficiency increases oxidative stress and sympathetic activity in both arterial and venous vessels , the impact on veins does not make a major contribution to this form of hypertension .
association of dr@@ d2 polymorphisms and chlorpromazine @-@ induced extrapyramidal syndrome in chin@@ ese schizophrenic patient@@ s. aim : extrapyramidal syndrome ( eps ) is most commonly affected by typical antipsychotic drugs that have a high affinity with the d2 recep@@ tor@@ . recently , many research groups have reported on the positive relationship between the genetic variations in the dr@@ d2 gene and the therapeutic response in schizophrenia patients as a result of the role of variations in the receptor in modulating receptor expres@@ sion@@ . in this study , we evaluate the role dr@@ d2 plays in chlorpromazine @-@ induced eps in schizophrenic patient@@ s. methods : we identified seven sn@@ p ( single nucleotide polymorphism ) ( -@@ 14@@ 1@@ c@@ ins &gt; del , ta@@ q@@ ib , ta@@ q@@ id , ser@@ 3@@ 11@@ cy@@ s , rs@@ 62@@ 75 , rs@@ 62@@ 77 and ta@@ q@@ ia ) in the dr@@ d2 gene in 146 schizophrenic inpatients ( 59 with eps and 87 without eps according to the simp@@ son @-@ ang@@ us scale ) treated with chlorpromazine after 8 week@@ s. the alleles of all loci were determined by p@@ cr ( polymerase chain reaction ) . results : polymorphisms ta@@ q@@ id , ser@@ 3@@ 11@@ cy@@ s and rs@@ 62@@ 77 were not polymorphic in the population recruited in the present stud@@ y@@ . no statistical significance was found in the allele distribution of -@@ 14@@ 1@@ c@@ ins &gt; del , ta@@ q@@ ib , rs@@ 62@@ 75 and ta@@ q@@ ia or in the estimated haplotypes ( constituted by ta@@ q@@ ib , rs@@ 62@@ 75 and ta@@ q@@ ia ) in linkage disequilibrium between the two grou@@ ps@@ . conclusion : our results did not lend strong support to the view that the genetic variation of the dr@@ d2 gene plays a major role in the individually variable adverse effect induced by chlorpromazine , at least in chin@@ ese patients with schizophren@@ i@@ a. our results confirmed a previous study on the relationship between dr@@ d2 and eps in ca@@ uc@@ asi@@ ans .
physical training decreases susceptibility to subsequent pilocarpine @-@ induced seizures in the rat@@ . regular motor activity has many benefits for mental and physical condition but its implications for epilepsy are still controver@@ sial@@ . in order to elucidate this problem , we have studied the effect of long @-@ term physical activity on susceptibility to subsequent seiz@@ u@@ res@@ . male w@@ istar rats were subjected to repeated training sessions in a treadmill and swimming po@@ ol@@ . thereafter , seizures were induced by pilocarpine injections in trained and non @-@ trained control grou@@ ps@@ . during the acute period of status epilepticus , we measured : ( 1 ) the latency of the first motor sign , ( 2 ) the intensity of seizures , ( 3 ) the time when it occurred within the 6 @-@ h observation period , and ( 4 ) the time when the acute period ende@@ d. all these behavioral parameters showed statistically significant changes suggesting that regular physical exercises decrease susceptibility to subsequently induced seizures and ameliorate the course of experimentally induced status epilepticus .
tonic dopaminergic stimulation impairs associative learning in healthy subjec@@ ts@@ . endogenous dopamine plays a central role in salience coding during associative lear@@ n@@ ing@@ . administration of the dopamine precursor levodopa enhances learning in healthy subjects and stroke patient@@ s. because levodopa increases both phasic and tonic dopaminergic neurotransmission , the critical mechanism mediating the enhancement of learning is un@@ resol@@ ve@@ d. we here probed how selective tonic dopaminergic stimulation affects associative lear@@ n@@ ing@@ . forty healthy subjects were trained in a novel vocabulary of 45 concrete no@@ un@@ s over the course of 5 consecutive training days in a prospective , randomized , double @-@ blind , placebo @-@ controlled design@@ . subjects received the ton@@ ically stimulating dopamine @-@ receptor agonist perg@@ olide ( 0.1 mg ) vs placebo 120 min before training on each training day@@ . the dopamine agonist significantly impaired novel word learning compared to plac@@ e@@ bo@@ . this learning decrement persisted up to the last follow @-@ up 4 weeks post @-@ train@@ ing@@ . subjects treated with perg@@ olide also showed restricted emotional responses compared to the placebo grou@@ p. the extent of &apos; flattened &apos; affect with perg@@ olide was related to the degree of learning inhib@@ iti@@ on@@ . these findings suggest that tonic occupation of dopamine receptors impairs learning by competition with phasic dopamine sign@@ al@@ s. thus , phasic signaling seems to be the critical mechanism by which dopamine enhances associative learning in healthy subjects and stroke patients .

acute renal failure associated with prolonged intake of s@@ lim@@ ming pills containing anthra@@ quin@@ on@@ es@@ . chin@@ ese herbal medicine preparations are widely available and often regarded by the public as natural and safe remedies for a variety of medical condi@@ tion@@ s. nephropathy caused by chin@@ ese herbs has previously been reported , usually involving the use of ari@@ st@@ ol@@ och@@ ic acid@@ s. we report a 23 @-@ year @-@ old woman who developed acute renal failure following prolonged use of a propri@@ etary chin@@ ese herbal s@@ lim@@ ming pill that contained anthra@@ quinone derivatives , extracted from rhiz@@ oma rhe@@ i ( rh@@ ub@@ ar@@ b ) . the renal injury was probably aggravated by the concomitant intake of a non @-@ steroidal anti @-@ inflammatory drug , dicl@@ ofen@@ ac@@ . renal pathology was that of hyp@@ ocellular interstitial fibro@@ si@@ s. spontaneous renal recovery occurred upon cessation of the s@@ lim@@ ming pills , but mild interstitial fibrosis and tubular atrophy was still evident histologically 4 months later@@ . although a causal relationship between the use of an anthra@@ quinone @-@ containing herbal agent and renal injury remains to be proven , phyt@@ otherapy @-@ associated interstitial nephropathy should be considered in patients who present with unexplained renal failure .
chloro@@ acetaldehyde as a sulfhydryl reagent : the role of critical thiol groups in ifosfamide nephro@@ path@@ y@@ . chloro@@ acetaldehyde ( ca@@ a ) is a metabolite of the alkylating agent ifosfamide ( if@@ o ) and putatively responsible for renal damage following anti @-@ tumor therapy with if@@ o. depletion of sulfhydryl ( sh ) groups has been reported from cell culture , animal and clinical studi@@ es@@ . in this work the effect of ca@@ a on human proximal tubule cells in primary culture ( hr@@ p@@ te@@ c ) was investig@@ ated@@ . toxicity of ca@@ a was determined by protein content , cell number , l@@ d@@ h release , trypan blue exclusion assay and caspase @-@ 3 activ@@ it@@ y@@ . free thiols were measured by the method of ell@@ man@@ . ca@@ a reduced hr@@ p@@ te@@ c cell number and protein , induced a loss in free intracellular thiols and an increase in necrosis mark@@ er@@ s. ca@@ a but not acro@@ lein inhibited the cysteine proteases caspase @-@ 3 , caspase @-@ 8 and cathepsin b@@ . caspase activation by cisplatin was inhibited by ca@@ a. in cells stained with fluorescent dyes targeting lysosomes , ca@@ a induced an increase in lysosomal size and lysosomal leak@@ ag@@ e. the effects of ca@@ a on cysteine protease activities and thiols could be reproduced in cell lys@@ at@@ e. acidification , which slowed the reaction of ca@@ a with thiol donors , could also attenuate effects of ca@@ a on necrosis markers , thiol depletion and cysteine protease inhibition in living cell@@ s. thus , ca@@ a directly reacts with cellular protein and non @-@ protein thiols , mediating its toxicity on hr@@ p@@ tec@@ . this effect can be reduced by acidi@@ fic@@ ation@@ . therefore , urinary acidification could be an option to prevent if@@ o nephropathy in patients .
stere@@ ological methods reveal the robust size and stability of ectopic hilar granule cells after pilocarpine @-@ induced status epilepticus in the adult rat@@ . following status epilepticus in the rat , dentate granule cell neurogenesis increases greatly , and many of the new neurons appear to develop ec@@ topically , in the hilar region of the hippocampal form@@ ation@@ . it has been suggested that the ectopic hilar granule cells could contribute to the spontaneous seizures that ultimately develop after status epilep@@ tic@@ us@@ . however , the population has never been quantified , so it is unclear whether it is substantial enough to have a strong influence on epilept@@ ogene@@ si@@ s. to quantify this population , the total number of ectopic hilar granule cells was estimated using unbiased stere@@ ology at different times after pilocarpine @-@ induced status epilep@@ tic@@ us@@ . the number of hilar neurons immunoreactive for pro@@ x @-@ 1 , a granule @-@ cell @-@ specific marker , was estimated using the optical fraction@@ ator method@@ . the results indicate that the size of the hilar ectopic granule cell population after status epilepticus is substantial , and stable over time@@ . interestingly , the size of the population appears to be correlated with the frequency of behavioral seizures , because animals with more ectopic granule cells in the hil@@ us have more frequent behavioral seiz@@ u@@ res@@ . the hilar ectopic granule cell population does not appear to vary systematically across the sep@@ tot@@ emporal axis , although it is associated with an increase in volume of the hil@@ us@@ . the results provide new insight into the potential role of ectopic hilar granule cells in the pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy .

increased vulnerability to 6 @-@ hydroxydopamine lesion and reduced development of dys@@ kine@@ sias in mice lacking c@@ b1 cannabinoid recep@@ tor@@ s. motor impairment , dopamine ( da ) neuronal activity and pro@@ enkephalin ( pen@@ k ) gene expression in the caudate @-@ putamen ( cp@@ u ) were measured in 6 @-@ oh@@ da @-@ lesioned and treated ( l @-@ dopa + ben@@ ser@@ azide ) c@@ b1 ko and wt mic@@ e. a lesion induced by 6 @-@ oh@@ da produced more severe motor deterioration in c@@ b1 ko mice accompanied by more loss of da neurons and increased pen@@ k gene expression in the c@@ pu@@ . oxidative / nitros@@ ative and neuro@@ inflammatory parameters were estimated in the cp@@ u and cingulate cortex ( c@@ g ) . c@@ b1 ko mice exhibited higher m@@ da levels and in@@ os protein expression in the cp@@ u and c@@ g compared to wt mic@@ e. treatment with l @-@ dopa + ben@@ ser@@ azide ( 12 weeks ) resulted in less severe dys@@ kine@@ sias in c@@ b1 ko than in wt mic@@ e. the results revealed that the lack of cannabinoid c@@ b1 receptors increased the severity of motor impairment and da lesion , and reduced l @-@ dopa @-@ induced dys@@ kine@@ si@@ as@@ . these results suggest that activation of c@@ b1 receptors offers neuroprotection against dopaminergic lesion and the development of l @-@ dopa @-@ induced dys@@ kine@@ sias .
animal model of mania induced by ouabain : evidence of oxidative stress in sub@@ mitochondrial particles of the rat bra@@ in@@ . the intracerebroventricular ( ic@@ v ) administration of ouabain ( a na ( + ) / k ( + ) -@@ at@@ p@@ ase inhibitor ) in rats has been suggested to mimic some symptoms of human bipolar man@@ i@@ a. clinical studies have shown that bipolar disorder may be related to mitochondrial dys@@ function@@ . herein , we investigated the behavioral and biochemical effects induced by the ic@@ v administration of ouabain in rat@@ s. to achieve this aim , the effects of ouabain injection immediately after and 7 days following a single ic@@ v administration ( at concentrations of 10 ( -2 ) and 10 ( -3 ) m ) on locomotion was measured using the open @-@ field test@@ . additionally , thiobarbituric acid reactive substances ( t@@ bar@@ ss ) and superoxide production were measured in sub@@ mitochondrial particles of the prefrontal cortex , hippocampus , striatum and amygdal@@ a. our findings demonstrated that ouabain at 10 ( -2 ) and 10 ( -3 ) m induced hyper@@ locomotion in rats , and this response remained up to 7 days following a single ic@@ v injec@@ tion@@ . in addition , we observed that the persistent increase in the rat spontaneous locomotion is associated with increased t@@ bars levels and superoxide generation in sub@@ mitochondrial particles in the prefrontal cortex , striatum and amygdal@@ a. in conclusion , ouabain @-@ induced mania @-@ like behavior may provide a useful animal model to test the hypothesis of the involvement of oxidative stress in bipolar disorder .
intraoperative dialysis during liver transplantation with citrate dialy@@ sat@@ e. liver transplantation for acutely ill patients with fulminant liver failure carries high intraoperative and immediate postoperative ris@@ k@@ s. these are increased with the presence of concomitant acute kidney injury ( aki ) and intraoperative dialysis is sometimes required to allow the transplant to proce@@ ed@@ . the derangements in the procoagulant and anticoagulant pathways during fulminant liver failure can lead to difficulties with anticoagulation during dialysis , especially when continued in the operating ro@@ om@@ . systemic anticoagulation is unsafe and regional citrate anticoagulation in the absence of a functional liver carries the risk of citrate toxic@@ it@@ y@@ . citrate dialysate , a new dialysate with citric acid can be used for anticoagulation in patients who cannot tolerate heparin or regional citr@@ at@@ e. we report a case of a 40 @-@ year @-@ old female with acetaminophen @-@ induced fulminant liver failure with associated aki who underwent intraoperative dialytic support during liver transplantation anti@@ coagulated with citrate dialysate during the entire proced@@ ure@@ . the patient tolerated the procedure well without any signs of citrate toxicity and maintained adequate anticoagulation for patency of the dialysis circu@@ it@@ . citrate dialysate is a safe alternative for intra@@ dialytic support of liver transplantation in fulminant liver failure .
delirium in a patient with toxic flec@@ ainide plasma concentrations : the role of a pharmacokinetic drug interaction with parox@@ eti@@ ne@@ . objective : to describe a case of flec@@ ainide @-@ induced delirium associated with a pharmacokinetic drug interaction with parox@@ eti@@ ne@@ . case summary : a 69 @-@ year @-@ old white female presented to the emergency department with a history of confusion and par@@ ano@@ ia over the past several day@@ s. on admission the patient was taking carvedilol 12 mg twice daily , warfarin 2 mg / day , folic acid 1 mg / day , lev@@ othyro@@ xine 100 microg / day , pant@@ oprazole 40 mg / day , paroxetine 40 mg / day , and flec@@ ainide 100 mg twice d@@ ail@@ y@@ . flec@@ ainide had been started 2 weeks prior for atrial fibrill@@ ation@@ . laboratory test findings on admission were notable only for a flec@@ ainide plasma concentration of 13@@ 60 microg / l ( reference range 200 @-@ 1000 ) . a metabolic drug interaction between flec@@ ainide and paroxetine , which the patient had been taking for more than 5 years , was consi@@ de@@ red@@ . paroxetine was discontinued and the dose of flec@@ ainide was reduced to 50 mg twice d@@ ail@@ y@@ . her delirium resolved 3 days later@@ . discussion : flec@@ ainide and pharmacologically similar agents that interact with sodium channels may cause delirium in susceptible patient@@ s. a med@@ line search ( 1966 @-@ j@@ anuary 2009 ) revealed one in vivo pharmacokinetic study on the interaction between flec@@ ainide , a cyp@@ 2@@ d@@ 6 substrate , and paroxetine , a cyp@@ 2@@ d@@ 6 inhibitor , as well as 3 case reports of flec@@ ainide @-@ induced del@@ ir@@ i@@ um@@ . according to the nar@@ anj@@ o probability scale , flec@@ ainide was the probable cause of the patient &apos;s delirium ; the horn drug interaction probability scale indicates a possible pharmacokinetic drug interaction between flec@@ ainide and parox@@ eti@@ ne@@ . conclusions : supra@@ therapeutic flec@@ ainide plasma concentrations may cause del@@ ir@@ i@@ um@@ . because toxicity may occur when flec@@ ainide is prescribed with paroxetine and other potent cyp@@ 2@@ d@@ 6 inhibitors , flec@@ ainide plasma concentrations should be monitored closely with commencement of cyp@@ 2@@ d@@ 6 inhibitors .

posttransplant anemia : the role of si@@ ro@@ lim@@ us@@ . posttransplant anemia is a common problem that may hinder patients &apos; quality of lif@@ e. it occurs in 12 to 76 % of patients , and is most common in the immediate posttransplant period@@ . a variety of factors have been identified that increase the risk of posttransplant anemia , of which the level of renal function is most import@@ ant@@ . sirolimus , a mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor , has been implicated as playing a special role in posttransplant an@@ em@@ i@@ a. this review considers anemia associated with sirolimus , including its presentation , mechanisms , and management .
coronary computerized tomography angiography for rapid discharge of low @-@ risk patients with cocaine @-@ associated chest pain@@ . background : most patients presenting to emergency departments ( eds ) with cocaine @-@ associated chest pain are admitted for at least 12 hours and receive a &quot; rule out acute coronary syndrome &quot; protocol , often with noninvasive testing prior to dis@@ charg@@ e. in patients without cocaine use , coronary computerized tomography angiography ( c@@ ta ) has been shown to be useful for identifying a group of patients at low risk for cardiac events who can be safely dis@@ charg@@ ed@@ . it is unclear whether a coronary c@@ ta strategy would be efficacious in cocaine @-@ associated chest pain , as coronary vasospasm may account for some of the ischem@@ i@@ a. we studied whether a negative coronary c@@ ta in patients with cocaine @-@ associated chest pain could identify a subset safe for dis@@ charg@@ e. methods : we prospectively evaluated the safety of coronary c@@ ta for low @-@ risk patients who presented to the ed with coc@@ ain@@ e@@ associated chest pain ( self @-@ reported or positive urine test ) . consecutive patients received either immediate coronary c@@ ta in the ed ( without serial markers ) or underwent coronary c@@ ta after a brief observation period with serial cardiac marker measure@@ ment@@ s. patients with negative coronary c@@ ta ( maximal stenosis less than 50 % ) were dis@@ charg@@ ed@@ . the main outcome was 30 @-@ day cardiovascular death or myocardial infarc@@ tion@@ . results : a total of 59 patients with cocaine @-@ associated chest pain were evalu@@ ated@@ . patients had a mean age of 4@@ 5.6 + / - 6.6 yrs and were 86 % black , 66 % mal@@ e. seventy @-@ nine percent had a normal or nonspecific ec@@ g and 85 % had a tim@@ i score &lt; 2. twenty patients received coronary c@@ ta immediately in the ed , 18 of whom were discharged following c@@ ta ( 90 % ) . thirty @-@ nine received coronary c@@ ta after a brief observation period , with 37 discharged home following c@@ ta ( 95 % ) . six patients had coronary stenosis &gt; or = 50 % . during the 30 @-@ day follow @-@ up period , no patients died of a cardiovascular event ( 0 % ; 95 % ci , 0 @-@ 6.1 % ) and no patient sustained a nonfatal myocardial infarction ( 0 % ; 95 % ci , 0 @-@ 6.1 % ) . conclusions : although cocaine @-@ associated myocardial ischemia can result from coronary vasoconstriction , patients with cocaine associated chest pain , a non @-@ ischemic ec@@ g , and a tim@@ i risk score &lt; 2 may be safely discharged from the ed after a negative coronary c@@ ta with a low risk of 30 @-@ day adverse events .
late fulminant posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome after liver transpl@@ ant@@ . objectives : posterior leukoencephalopathy due to calcineurin @-@ inhibitor @-@ related neurotoxicity is a rare but severe complication that results from treatment with immunosuppressive agents ( primarily those administered after a liver or kidney transplant ) . the pathophysiologic mechanisms of that disorder remain un@@ know@@ n@@ . case : we report the case of a 46 @-@ year @-@ old woman who received a liver transplant in our center as treatment for alcoholic cirrhosis and in whom either a fulminant course of posterior leukoencephalopathy or posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome developed 110 days after transpl@@ ant@@ . after an initially uneventful course after the transplant , the patient rapidly fell into deep com@@ a. results : cerebral m@@ ri scan showed typical signs of enhancement in the pontine and posterior regi@@ on@@ s. switching the immunosuppressive regimen from tacrolimus to cyclosporine did not improve the clinical situ@@ ation@@ . the termination of treatment with any calcineurin inhibitor resulted in a complete resolution of that complic@@ ation@@ . conclusions : posterior reversible encephalopathy syndrome after liver transplant is ra@@ re@@ . we recommend a complete cessation of any calcineurin inhibitor rather than a dose reduction .

bin@@ asal visual field defects are not specific to vig@@ ab@@ atr@@ in@@ . this study investigated the visual defects associated with the antiepileptic drug vig@@ ab@@ atr@@ in ( v@@ g@@ b ) . two hundred four people with epilepsy were grouped on the basis of antiepileptic drug therapy ( current , previous , or no exposure to v@@ g@@ b ) . groups were matched with respect to age , gender , and seizure frequ@@ enc@@ y@@ . all patients underwent objective assessment of electrophysiological function ( wide @-@ field multifocal electroretin@@ ography ) and conventional visual field testing ( static perimetry ) . bilateral visual field constriction was observed in 59 % of patients currently taking v@@ g@@ b , 43 % of patients who previously took v@@ g@@ b , and 24 % of patients with no exposure to v@@ g@@ b@@ . assessment of retinal function revealed abnormal responses in 48 % of current v@@ g@@ b users and 22 % of prior v@@ g@@ b users , but in none of the patients without previous exposure to v@@ g@@ b@@ . bilateral visual field abnormalities are common in the treated epilepsy population , irrespective of drug histor@@ y@@ . assessment by conventional static perimetry may neither be sufficiently sensitive nor specific to reliably identify retinal toxicity associated with v@@ g@@ b .
smoking of crack cocaine as a risk factor for hi@@ v infection among people who use injection dru@@ g@@ s. background : little is known about the possible role that smoking crack cocaine has on the incidence of hi@@ v infec@@ tion@@ . given the increasing use of crack cocaine , we sought to examine whether use of this illicit drug has become a risk factor for hi@@ v infec@@ tion@@ . methods : we included data from people participating in the v@@ anc@@ ou@@ ver injection drug users study who reported injecting illicit drugs at least once in the month before enrolment , lived in the greater v@@ anc@@ ou@@ ver area , were hi@@ v @-@ negative at enrolment and completed at least 1 follow @-@ up study vis@@ it@@ . to determine whether the risk of hi@@ v seroconversion among daily smokers of crack cocaine changed over time , we used co@@ x proportional hazards regression and divided the study into 3 periods : may 1 , 1996 @-@ nov . 30 , 1999 ( period 1 ) , de@@ c . 1 , 1999 @-@ nov . 30 , 2002 ( period 2 ) , and de@@ c . 1 , 2002 @-@ de@@ c . 30 , 2005 ( period 3 ) . results : overall , 10@@ 48 eligible injection drug users were included in our stud@@ y@@ . of these , 137 acquired hi@@ v infection during follow @-@ up@@ . the mean proportion of participants who reported daily smoking of crack cocaine increased from 11.6 % in period 1 to 3@@ 9.7 % in period 3. after adjusting for potential confounders , we found that the risk of hi@@ v seroconversion among participants who were daily smokers of crack cocaine increased over time ( period 1 : hazard ratio &#91; hr &#93; 1.03 , 95 % confidence interval &#91; ci &#93; 0.57 @-@ 1.85 ; period 2 : hr 1.68 , 95 % ci 1.01 @-@ 2.@@ 80 ; and period 3 : hr 2.@@ 74 , 95 % ci 1.06 @-@ 7.@@ 11 ) . interpretation : smoking of crack cocaine was found to be an independent risk factor for hi@@ v seroconversion among people who were injection drug us@@ er@@ s. this finding points to the urgent need for evidence @-@ based public health initiatives targeted at people who smoke crack cocaine .
fluoxetine improves the memory deficits caused by the chemotherapy agent 5 @-@ fluoro@@ ur@@ ac@@ il@@ . cancer patients who have been treated with systemic adjuvant chemotherapy have described experiencing deterior@@ ations in cogn@@ iti@@ on@@ . a widely used chemotherapeutic agent , 5 @-@ fluorouracil ( 5 @-@ f@@ u ) , readily crosses the blood @-@ brain barrier and so could have a direct effect on brain function@@ . in particular this anti mitotic drug could reduce cell proliferation in the neurogenic regions of the adult bra@@ in@@ . in contrast reports indicate that hippocampal dependent neurogenesis and cognition are enhanced by the ss@@ ri antidepressant flu@@ ox@@ eti@@ ne@@ . in this investigation the behavioural effects of chronic ( two week ) treatment with 5 @-@ f@@ u and ( three weeks ) with fluoxetine either separately or in combination with 5 @-@ f@@ u were tested on adult li@@ ster ho@@ oded rat@@ s. behavioural effects were tested using a context dependent conditioned emotional response test ( cer ) which showed that animals treated with 5 @-@ f@@ u had a significant reduction in freezing time compared to contro@@ l@@ s. a separate group of animals was tested using a hippocampal dependent spatial working memory test , the object location recognition test ( ol@@ r ) . animals treated only with 5 @-@ f@@ u showed significant deficits in their ability to carry out the ol@@ r task but co administration of fluoxetine improved their performance . 5 @-@ f@@ u chemotherapy caused a significant reduction in the number of proliferating cells in the sub granular zone of the dentate gyrus compared to contro@@ l@@ s. this reduction was eliminated when fluoxetine was co administered with 5 @-@ fu@@ . fluoxetine on its own had no effect on proliferating cell number or behavi@@ our@@ . these findings suggest that 5 @-@ f@@ u can negatively affect both cell proliferation and hippocampal dependent working memory and that these deficits can be reversed by the simultaneous administration of the antidepressant fluoxetine .
liver @-@ specific ablation of integrin @-@ linked kinase in mice results in enhanced and prolonged cell proliferation and hepatomegaly after phenobarbital administr@@ ation@@ . we have recently demonstrated that disruption of extracellular matrix ( ec@@ m ) / integrin signaling via elimination of integrin @-@ linked kinase ( il@@ k ) in hepatocytes interferes with signals leading to termination of liver re@@ gener@@ ation@@ . this study investigates the role of il@@ k in liver enlargement induced by phenobarbital ( p@@ b ) . wild @-@ type ( wt ) and il@@ k : li@@ ver@@ - / - mice were given p@@ b ( 0.1 % in drinking water ) for 10 day@@ s. livers were harvested on 2 , 5 , and 10 days during p@@ b administr@@ ation@@ . in the hepatocyte @-@ specific il@@ k / li@@ ver@@ - / - mice , the liver : body weight ratio was more than double as compared to 0 h at day 2 ( 2.5 times ) , while at days 5 and 10 , it was enlarged three tim@@ es@@ . in the wt mice , the increase was as expected from previous literature ( 1.8 times ) and seems to have lev@@ eled off after day 2. there were slightly increased proliferating cell nuclear antigen @-@ positive cells in the il@@ k / li@@ ver@@ - / - animals at day 2 as compared to wt after p@@ b administr@@ ation@@ . in the wt animals , the proliferative response had come back to normal by days 5 and 10@@ . hepatocytes of the il@@ k / li@@ ver@@ - / - mice continued to proliferate up until day 10@@ . il@@ k / li@@ ver@@ - / - mice also showed increased expression of key genes involved in hepatocyte proliferation at different time points during p@@ b administr@@ ation@@ . in summary , ec@@ m proteins communicate with the signaling machinery of dividing cells via il@@ k to regulate hepatocyte proliferation and termination of the proliferative respon@@ se@@ . lack of il@@ k in the hepatocytes im@@ parts prolonged proliferative response not only to stimuli related to liver regeneration but also to xenobiotic chemical mitogens , such as p@@ b .

medical and psychiatric outcomes for patients transplanted for acetaminophen @-@ induced acute liver failure : a case @-@ control stud@@ y@@ . background : acetaminophen @-@ induced hepatotoxicity is the most common cause of acute liver failure ( al@@ f ) in the uk@@ . patients often consume the drug with suicidal intent or with a background of substance depend@@ enc@@ e. aims and methods : we compared the severity of pretransplant illness , psychiatric co @-@ morbidity , medical and psychosocial outcomes of all patients who had undergone liver transplantation ( lt ) emergen@@ tly between 1999 @-@ 2004 for acetaminophen @-@ induced al@@ f ( n = 36 ) with age- and sex @-@ matched patients undergoing emergent lt for non @-@ acetaminophen @-@ induced al@@ f ( n = 35 ) and elective lt for chronic liver disease ( cl@@ d , n = 34 ) . results : acetaminophen @-@ induced al@@ f patients undergoing lt had a greater severity of pre @-@ lt illness reflected by higher acute physiology and chronic health evaluation ii scores and requirement for organ support compared with the other two grou@@ ps@@ . twenty ( 56 % ) acetaminophen @-@ induced al@@ f patients had a formal psychiatric diagnosis before lt ( non @-@ acetaminophen @-@ induced al@@ f = 0 / 35 , cl@@ d = 2 / 34 ; p &lt; 0.01 for all ) and nine ( 25 % ) had a previous suicide attemp@@ t. during follow @-@ up ( median 5 years ) , there were no significant differences in rejection ( acute and chronic ) , graft failure or survival between the groups ( acetaminophen @-@ induced al@@ f 1 year 87 % , 5 years 75 % ; non @-@ acetaminophen @-@ induced al@@ f 88 % , 78 % ; cl@@ d 93 % , 82 % : p &gt; 0.6 log rank ) . two acetaminophen @-@ induced al@@ f patients reat@@ temp@@ ted suicide post @-@ lt ( one died 8 years post @-@ lt ) . conclusions : despite a high prevalence of psychiatric disturbance , outcomes for patients transplanted emergen@@ tly for acetaminophen @-@ induced al@@ f were comparable to those transplanted for non @-@ acetaminophen @-@ induced al@@ f and elec@@ tively for cl@@ d. multidisciplinary approaches with long @-@ term psychiatric follow @-@ up may contribute to low post @-@ transplant suicide rates seen and low rates of graft loss because of non @-@ compliance .
studies of synergy between morphine and a novel sodium channel blocker , c@@ ns@@ b@@ 002 , in rat models of inflammatory and neuropathic pain@@ . objective : this study determined the anti@@ hyper@@ algesic effect of c@@ ns@@ b@@ 002 , a sodium channel blocker with antioxidant properties given alone and in combinations with morphine in rat models of inflammatory and neuropathic pain@@ . design : dose response curves for non@@ sed@@ ating doses of morphine and c@@ ns@@ b@@ 002 given intraperitoneally alone and together in combinations were constructed for anti@@ hyper@@ algesic effect using paw withdrawal from noxious heat in two rat pain models : carrageenan @-@ induced paw inflammation and streptozotocin ( st@@ z ) -induced diabetic neuro@@ path@@ y@@ . results : the maximum non@@ sed@@ ating doses were : morphine , 3.2 mg / kg ; c@@ ns@@ b@@ 002 10.0 mg / kg ; 5.0 mg / kg c@@ ns@@ b@@ 002 with morphine 3.2 mg / kg in combin@@ ation@@ . the doses calculated to cause 50 % reversal of hyperalgesia ( ed@@ 50 ) were 7.@@ 54 ( 1.81 ) and 4.@@ 83 ( 1.54 ) in the carrageenan model and 44.@@ 18 ( 1.37 ) and 9.@@ 14 ( 1.24 ) in the st@@ z @-@ induced neuropathy model for c@@ ns@@ b@@ 002 and morphine , respectively ( mg / kg ; mean , se@@ m ) . these values were greater than the maximum non@@ sed@@ ating dos@@ es@@ . the ed@@ 50 values for morphine when given in combination with c@@ ns@@ b@@ 002 ( 5 mg / kg ) were less than the maximum non@@ sed@@ ating dose : 0.56 ( 1.55 ) in the carrageenan model and 1.37 ( 1.23 ) in the neuropathy model ( mg / kg ; mean , se@@ m ) . the antinociception after morphine ( 3.2 mg / kg ) was increased by co @-@ administration with c@@ ns@@ b@@ 002 from 28.@@ 0 and 31.7 % to 1@@ 14.6 and 5@@ 6.9 % reversal of hyperalgesia in the inflammatory and neuropathic models , respectively ( p &lt; 0.01 ; one @-@ way analysis of variance @-@ significantly greater than either drug given alone ) . conclusions : the maximum anti@@ hyper@@ algesic effect achievable with non@@ sed@@ ating doses of morphine may be increased significantly when the drug is used in combination with c@@ ns@@ b@@ 002 .
heparin @-@ induced thrombocytopenia : a practical review@@ . heparin @-@ induced thrombocytopenia ( hit ) remains under @-@ recognized despite its potentially devastating outcom@@ es@@ . it begins when heparin exposure stimulates the formation of heparin @-@ platelet factor 4 antibodies , which in turn triggers the release of procoagulant platelet parti@@ cl@@ es@@ . thrombosis and thrombocytopenia that follow comprise the 2 hallmark traits of hit , with the former largely responsible for significant vascular complic@@ ation@@ s. the prevalence of hit varies among several subgroups , with greater incidence in surgical as compared with medical popul@@ ation@@ s. hit must be acknowledged for its intense predilection for thrombosis and suspected whenever thrombosis occurs after heparin expos@@ ure@@ . early recognition that incorporates the clinical and serologic clues is paramount to timely institution of treatment , as its delay may result in catastrophic outcom@@ es@@ . the treatment of hit man@@ dates an immediate cessation of all heparin exposure and the institution of an antithrombotic therapy , most commonly using a direct thrombin inhibit@@ or@@ . current &quot; diagnostic &quot; tests , which primarily include functional and antigenic assays , have more of a confirmatory than diagnostic role in the management of h@@ it@@ . special attention must be paid to cardiac patients who are often exposed to heparin multiple times during their course of treat@@ ment@@ . direct thrombin inhibitors are appropriate , evidence @-@ based alternatives to heparin in patients with a history of hit , who need to undergo percutaneous coronary inter@@ venti@@ on@@ . as heparin remains one of the most frequently used medications today with potential for hit with every heparin exposure , a close vigilance of platelet counts must be practiced whenever heparin is initiated .

the role of nitric oxide in convulsions induced by lin@@ dane in rat@@ s. lin@@ dane is an organochlor@@ ide pesticide and sc@@ ab@@ ici@@ de@@ . it evokes convulsions mainly trough the blockage of gab@@ a ( a ) recep@@ tor@@ s. nitric oxide ( no ) , gaseous neurotransmitter , has contradic@@ tor role in epilept@@ ogenesis due to opposite effects of l @-@ arginine , precursor of no syntheses ( nos ) , and l @-@ name ( nos inhibitor ) observed in different epilepsy mod@@ el@@ s. the aim of the current study was to determine the effects of no on the behavioral and e@@ eg characteristics of lin@@ dane @-@ induced epilepsy in male w@@ istar albino rat@@ s. the administration of l @-@ arginine ( 600 , 800 and 1000 mg / kg , i.p. ) in dose @-@ dependent manner significantly increased convul@@ sion incidence and severity and shortened latency time to first convul@@ sion elicited by lower lin@@ dane dose ( 4 mg / kg , i.p. ) . on the contrary , pretreatment with l @-@ name ( 500 , 700 and 900 mg / kg , i.p. ) decreased convul@@ sion incidence and severity and prolonged latency time to convul@@ sion following injection with a convulsive dose of lin@@ dane ( 8 mg / kg , i.p. ) . e@@ eg analyses showed increase of number and duration of ictal periods in e@@ eg of rats receiving l @-@ arginine prior to lin@@ dane and decrease of this number in rats pretreated with l @-@ n@@ ame@@ . these results support the conclusion that no plays a role of endogenous convulsant in rat model of lin@@ dane seizures .
long @-@ term oral galactose treatment prevents cognitive deficits in male w@@ istar rats treated intracerebro@@ ventricul@@ arly with strepto@@ zot@@ oc@@ in@@ . basic and clinical research has demonstrated that dementia of sporadic al@@ z@@ heimer &apos;s disease ( s@@ ad ) type is associated with dysfunction of the insulin @-@ receptor ( ir ) system followed by decreased glucose transport via glucose transporter glut@@ 4 and decreased glucose metabolism in brain cell@@ s. an alternative source of energy is d @-@ galactose ( the c @-@ 4 @-@ ep@@ imer of d @-@ glucose ) which is transported into the brain by insulin @-@ independent glut@@ 3 transporter where it might be metabolized to glucose via the l@@ elo@@ ir path@@ w@@ ay@@ . exclusively parenteral daily injections of galactose induce memory deterioration in rodents and are used to generate animal aging model , but the effects of oral galactose treatment on cognitive functions have never been te@@ ste@@ d. we have investigated the effects of continuous daily oral galactose ( 200 mg / kg / day ) treatment on cognitive deficits in streptozotocin @-@ induced ( st@@ z @-@ ic@@ v ) rat model of s@@ ad , tested by mor@@ ris water maze and passive avoidance test , respec@@ ti@@ vel@@ y@@ . one month of oral galactose treatment initiated immediately after the st@@ z @-@ ic@@ v administration , successfully prevented development of the st@@ z @-@ ic@@ v @-@ induced cognitive defic@@ it@@ s. beneficial effect of oral galactose was independent of the rat age and of the galactose dose ranging from 100 to 300 mg / kg / day@@ . additionally , oral galactose administration led to the appearance of galactose in the blood@@ . the increase of galactose concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid was several times lower after oral than after parenteral administration of the same galactose dos@@ e. oral galactose exposure might have beneficial effects on learning and memory ability and could be worth investigating for improvement of cognitive deficits associated with glucose hyp@@ omet@@ abolism in ad .
