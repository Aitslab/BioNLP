        "abstract": "Psoralen and isopsoralen, furocoumarins isolated from the plant Psoralea corylifolia L., were demonstrated to exhibit in vitro inhibitory actions on monoamine oxidase (MAO) activities in rat brain mitochondria, preferentially inhibiting MAO-A activity over MAO-B activity. This inhibition of enzyme activities was found to be dose-dependent and reversible. For MAO-A, the IC50 values are 15.2 +/- 1.3 microM psoralen and 9.0 +/- 0.6 microM isopsoralen. For MAO-B, the IC50 values are 61.8 +/- 4.3 microM psoralen and 12.8 +/- 0.5 microM isopsoralen. Lineweaver-Burk transformation of the inhibition data indicates that inhibition by both psoralen and isopsoralen is non-competitive for MAO-A. The Ki values were calculated to be 14.0 microM for psoralen and 6.5 microM for isopsoralen. On the other hand, inhibition by both psoralen and isopsoralen is competitive for MAO-B. The Ki values were calculated to be 58.1 microM for psoralen and 10.8 microM for isopsoralen. These inhibitory actions of psoralen and isopsoralen on rat brain mitochondrial MAO activities are discussed in relation to their toxicities and their potential applications to treat affective disorders.",

        "abstract": "Janus kinase 3 (Jak3) is a cytoplasmic tyrosine (Tyr) kinase associated with the interleukin-2 (IL-2) receptor common gamma chain (gamma(c)) that is activated by multiple T-cell growth factors (TCGFs) such as IL-2, -4, and -7. Using human T cells, it was found that a recently discovered variant of the undecylprodigiosin family of antibiotics, PNU156804, previously shown to inhibit IL-2-induced cell proliferation, also blocks IL-2-mediated Jak3 auto-tyrosine phosphorylation, activation of Jak3 substrates signal transducers and activators of transcription (Stat) 5a and Stat5b, and extracellular regulated kinase 1 (Erk1) and Erk2 (p44/p42). Although PNU156804 displayed similar efficacy in blocking Jak3-dependent T-cell proliferation by IL-2, -4, -7, or -15, it was more than 2-fold less effective in blocking Jak2-mediated cell growth, its most homologous Jak family member. A 14-day alternate-day oral gavage with 40 to 120 mg/kg PNU156804 extended the survival of heart allografts in a dose-dependent fashion. In vivo, PNU156804 acted synergistically with the signal 1 inhibitor cyclosporine A (CsA) and additively with the signal 3 inhibitor rapamycin to block allograft rejection.

The bradykinin-degrading enzyme, neutral endopeptidase (NEP, EC.3.4.24.11), is a potential target for coronary artery vasodilators. In this study, we examined the effect of thiorphan, an inhibitor of NEP, on the tone of porcine isolated coronary artery under hypoxic conditions. Endothelium-intact porcine isolated coronary artery rings were isometrically contracted with a prostaglandin F(2alpha) analogue (U46619, 0.75 microM) and potassium chloride (KCl, 30 mM), and relaxed with bradykinin (1-1000 nM) under normoxic (partial pressure of oxygen, pO(2) approximately 90-100 mmHg) and moderately hypoxic (pO(2) approximately 50-60 mmHg) conditions. Experiments were performed to study the effects of 30 min pre-treatment with the NEP-inhibitor, thiorphan (10 microM), both at physiological and at low pO(2)s. Hypoxia inhibited the bradykinin-induced relaxation in porcine epicardial coronary arteries. In normoxia, thiorphan significantly enhanced the decrease of coronary tone produced by bradykinin (1-10 nM) when U46619 was used as contractile agent. Under hypoxic conditions, in U46619 contracture, thiorphan did not influence, but in KCl contracture it enhanced the magnitude of relaxations induced by bradykinin. In the absence of bradykinin, thiorphan had no significant effect on the basal, KCl- and U46619-elevated tones and on the hypoxia-induced decrease of coronary artery tone. Inhibition of NEP-enzyme activity may effectively improve the relaxing capacity of epicardial coronary arteries under hypoxic/hyperkalemic conditions. This effect could be potentially utilized when the endothelial function and relaxation of the coronary arteries are impaired under clinical conditions.",

The agonist potencies and selectivities of these compounds for metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) were studied by examining their effects on the signal transduction of representative mGluR1, mGluR2 and mGluR4 subtypes in Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing the individual cloned receptors. 2. Two extended isomers of L-CCG, L-CCG-I and L-CCG-II, effectively stimulated phosphatidylinositol hydrolysis in mGluR1-expressing cells. The rank order of potencies of these compounds was L-glutamate &gt; L-CCG-I &gt; L-CCG-II. 3. L-CCG-I and L-CCG-II were effective in inhibiting the forskolin-stimulated adenosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate (cyclic AMP) accumulation in mGluR2-expressing cells. Particularly, L-CCG-I was a potent agonist for mGluR2 with an EC50 value of 3 x 10(-7) M, which was more than an order of potency greater than that of L-glutamate. 4. L-CCG-I evoked an inhibition of the forskolin-stimulated cyclic AMP production characteristic of mGluR4 with a potency comparable to L-glutamate. 5. In contrast to the above compounds, the other CCG isomers showed no appreciable effects on the signal transduction involved in the three mGluR subtypes. 6. This investigation demonstrates not only the importance of a particular isomeric structure of CCGs in the interaction with the mGluRs but also a clear receptor subtype specificity for the CCG-receptor interaction, and indicates that the CCG isomers would serve as useful agonists for investigation of functions of the mGluR family.",

        "abstract": "In response to DNA damage, cells arrest progression through the cell cycle at either G(1), S, or G(2). We have reported that UCN-01 (7-hydroxystaurosporine) abrogates DNA damage-induced S and G(2) arrest and enhances cytotoxicity selectively in p53 mutant cells, thus providing a potential, tumor-targeted therapy. Unfortunately, UCN-01 binds avidly to human plasma proteins, limiting bioavailability. Because UCN-01 also inhibits protein kinase C (PKC), we screened other PKC inhibitors, expecting them to be unable to abrogate arrest. However, Go6976 potently abrogated S and G(2) arrest and enhanced the cytotoxicity of the topoisomerase I inhibitor SN38 only in p53-defective cells. Importantly, Go6976 was nearly as potent at abrogating S and G(2) arrest in human serum, a property not possessed by UCN-01. Cell viability studies demonstrated that Go6976 was impressively nontoxic as a single agent. Analysis of proteins that regulate cell cycle arrest suggested that both drugs inhibit the checkpoint kinases Chk1 and/or Chk2. Additionally, Go6976 abrogated S and G(2) arrest at a concentration substantially lower than that required to inhibit PKC; UCN-01 did not demonstrate this selectivity for checkpoint inhibition.

Although SIB-1893 and MPEP had no effects alone in GTPgammaS binding, effects were observed in the cell-based cAMP assay due to media-derived activation as indicated by CPPG inhibition. Positive modulation of the mGluR4 was a receptor-specific effect since SIB-1893 and MPEP had neither effects on mGluR2-expressing cells nor on the parent BHK cell line. In [(3)H]L-AP4 binding, a two-fold decrease in K(D) but not in B(max) was observed with 100 micro M SIB-1893, whereas MPEP affected neither parameter.

In our efforts to understand the role of pathway in affecting metabolism under normoxic and ischemic conditions, as well as in ischemic injury in myocardium, we investigated the importance of SDH by use of a specific inhibitor (SDI), CP-470,711. SDH inhibition increased glucose oxidation, whereas palmitate oxidation remained unaffected. Global ischemia increased myocardial SDH activity by approximately 1.5 fold. The tissue lactate/pyruvate ratio, a measure of cytosolic NADH/NAD+, was reduced by SDH inhibition under both normoxic and ischemic conditions. ATP was higher in SDI hearts during ischemia and reperfusion. Creatine kinase release during reperfusion, a marker of myocardial ischemic injury, was markedly attenuated in SDH-inhibited hearts. These data indicate that myocardial SDH activation is a component of ischemic response and that interventions that inhibit SDH protect ischemic myocardium.

Many neuropsychiatric drugs are known to potently antagonize the H1R, thereby producing some of their side effects. In contrast, the tolerability and potential therapeutic utility of H1R agonism is currently unclear. We have used a cell-based functional assay to evaluate known therapeutics and reference drugs for H1R agonist activity. Our initial functional screen identified three ergot-based compounds possessing heretofore-unknown H1R agonist activity. 8R-lisuride demonstrated potent agonist activity in various assays including receptor selection and amplification technology, inositol phosphate accumulation, and activation of nuclear factor-kappaB with pEC50 values of 8.1, 7.9, and 7.9, respectively, and with varying degrees of efficacy. Based on these assays, 8R-lisuride is the most potent stereospecific partial agonist for the human H1R yet reported. Investigation of the residues involved in histamine and lisuride binding, using H1R mutants and molecular modeling, have revealed that although these ligands are structurally different, the lisuride-binding pocket in the H1R closely corresponds to the histamine-binding pocket. The discovery of a potent stereospecific partial H1R agonist provides a valuable tool to further characterize this important therapeutic target in vitro.",

In this report we describe a new PPAR gamma agonist, CLX-0921, that is derived from a natural product. This thiazolidinedione (TZD) has a spectrum of activity that differs from commercially available TZDs. It is a weak activator of PPAR gamma (EC(50) of 0.284 micromol/L) compared to rosiglitazone (EC(50) 0.009 micromol/L). Despite this difference, the drug maintains potent glucose uptake activity in vitro and glucose-lowering activity in vivo that is equipotent to that of rosiglitazone. Moreover, CLX-0921 showed a 10-fold reduction in in vitro adipogenic potential compared to rosiglitazone. CLX-0921 also increases glycogen synthesis, an activity not typically associated with rosiglitazone or pioglitazone.

Inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases are therefore of interest as anticancer drugs. CP-471,358 is a matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor that in vitro demonstrates strong inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases 2 and 9. The drug can be administered orally without food restriction. STUDY DESIGN: An open-label phase I study was performed in patients with advanced solid tumors to assess the safety, tolerability, maximal tolerated dose (MTD) and pharmacokinetics of CP-471,358. The CP-471,358 doses studied were 50, 100 and 200 mg three times daily (TID) continuously, 50, 100 and 200 mg TID for 21 days followed by a 1-week treatment-free interval and 75 mg and 150 mg twice daily (BID) continuously. RESULTS: A total of 38 patients were treated in the study. The median number of cycles administered was two (range one to five). Myalgia and arthralgia were the most frequently observed adverse events (in 27 of 38 patients) and were observed at all dose levels and with all schedules except for the 150 mg BID continuous dosing level. In six patients National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) grade 3 myalgia/arthralgia was observed and this adverse event was considered to be the dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). Introduction of a 1-week treatment-free interval between cycles had no effect on the occurrence of myalgia/arthralgia. After cessation of treatment, arthralgia/myalgia was reversible in all patients. Other adverse events observed were fatigue and an increase of liver enzymes but these rarely exceeded CTC grade 2. Pharmacokinetic analysis showed that target efficacious concentrations were achieved throughout the morning dosing interval with 150 mg BID and 200 mg TID. CONCLUSION: The DLT of CP-471,358 was myalgia and arthralgia, an adverse event observed during treatment with most matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors. A drug-free interval of 1 week was unable to prevent the occurrence of these adverse effects. Clearly this represents a limitation for potential long-term use of this compound.",

In this report, we show that VX-944 inhibits in vitro growth of human multiple myeloma (MM) cell lines via induction of apoptosis. Interleukin-6, insulin-like growth factor-1, or co-culture with bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs) do not protect against VX-944-induced MM cell growth inhibition. VX-944 induced apoptosis in MM cell lines with only modest activation of caspases 3, 8, and 9. Furthermore, the pan-caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk did not inhibit VX-944-induced apoptosis and cell death. During VX-944-induced apoptosis, expressions of Bax and Bak were enhanced, and both apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) and endonuclease G (Endo G) were released from the mitochondria to cytosol, suggesting that VX-944 triggers apoptosis in MM cells primarily via a caspase-independent, Bax/AIF/Endo G pathway. Importantly, VX-944 augments the cytotoxicity of doxorubicin and melphalan even in the presence of BMSCs. Taken together, our data demonstrate a primarily non-caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway triggered by VX-944, thereby providing a rationale to enhance MM cell cytotoxicity by combining this agent with conventional agents which trigger caspase activation.",

        "abstract": "The excitatory amino acid transporters (EAATs) play key roles in the regulation of CNS L-glutamate, especially related to synthesis, signal termination, synaptic spillover, and excitotoxic protection. Inhibitors available to delineate EAAT pharmacology and function are essentially limited to those that non-selectively block all EAATs or those that exhibit a substantial preference for EAAT2. Thus, it is difficult to selectively study the other subtypes, particularly EAAT1 and EAAT3. Structure activity studies on a series of beta-substituted aspartate analogues identify L-beta-benzyl-aspartate (L-beta-BA) as among the first blockers that potently and preferentially inhibits the neuronal EAAT3 subtype. Kinetic analysis of D-[(3)H]aspartate uptake into C17.2 cells expressing the hEAATs demonstrate that L-beta-threo-BA is the more potent diastereomer, acts competitively, and exhibits a 10-fold preference for EAAT3 compared to EAAT1 and EAAT2. Electrophysiological recordings of EAAT-mediated currents in Xenopus oocytes identify L-beta-BA as a non-substrate inhibitor. Analyzing L-beta-threo-BA within the context of a novel EAAT2 pharmacophore model suggests: (1) a highly conserved positioning of the electrostatic carboxyl and amino groups; (2) nearby regions that accommodate select structural modifications (cyclopropyl rings, methyl groups, oxygen atoms); and (3) a unique region L-beta-threo-BA occupied by the benzyl moieties of L-TBOA, L-beta-threo-BA and related analogues. It is plausible that the preference of L-beta-threo-BA and L-TBOA for EAAT3 and EAAT2, respectively, could reside in the latter two pharmacophore regions.",

In this study, we synthesized three classes of novel polyammonium compounds incorporating the bicyclic unit 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane (DABCO) and tested their action on three representative mammalian Kv channels (Kv2.1, Kv3.4, and Kv4.2) expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. Nonsubstituted DABCO did not block the Kv channels tested. Simple DABCO monostrings and diDABCO strings inhibited Kv2.1 and Kv3.4 channels, with potency increasing with string length for both these DABCO classes. Both Kv2.1 and Kv3.4 were most sensitive to C16 monostrings, with IC50 values of 1.9 and 0.6 microM, respectively. For compounds comprising two DABCO groups separated by an aromatic ring, inhibition depended upon relative positioning of the two DABCO groups, and only the para form (JC638.2alpha) was active, blocking Kv2.1 with an IC50 of 186 microM. Kv4.2 channels were relatively insensitive to all compounds tested. Unlike the tetraethylammonium ion (TEA), neither JC638.2alpha nor C16 monostring TA279 produced block when applied intracellularly via the recording electrode to Kv2.1 channels expressed in Chinese hamster ovary cells, suggesting against an internal site of action. However, JC638.2alpha protected an introduced cysteine (K356C) in the Kv2.1 outer pore from permanent modification by methanethiosulfonate ethyltrimethylammonium (MTSET). These data suggest that JC638.2alpha occupies an external binding site similar to that of TEA in the Kv2.1 outer pore, but with much higher affinity than TEA. These DABCO salts represent a new class of Kv channel blockers, some with higher potencies than any previously described quaternary ammonium ions. The potential for synthesis of an array of modular derivatives suggests that DABCO compounds hold promise as probes of Kv channel structure and identity and as potential therapeutic agents.",

They were found to potentiate cholinergic transmission by significantly increasing the time constant of decay (Tc) of inhibitory postsynaptic currents (IPSCs). The postsynaptic origin of the phenomenon was supported by the observation that responses to the ionophoretic application of acetylcholine (ACh) were also potentiated in duration as well as in amplitude. No effects of S-9977-2 on the ACh-gated Cl- channel conductance or mean open time were observed. The finding that responses to the hydrolysis-resistant cholinergic analogue carbachol were unaffected by the two xanthines suggested that the observed effects were at least partly caused by an inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity. That these substances inhibit AChE activity was confirmed in vitro. Phosphorylation processes nonetheless appear to be partly involved in the synaptic effect of the xanthines as the kinase blocker H-8 blocked part of the IPSC Tc lengthening.

        "abstract": "Previous studies have confirmed that proliferation in glioblastoma cell lines can be blocked by non-isoform specific protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitors, e.g calphostin C, staurosporine. However, the exact mechanism of PKC involvement is poorly understood. The aim of this study was to explore the role of specific PKC isoforms in the aberrant growth of glioblastoma. Identification of the isoform(s) critical for proliferation in glioblastoma would present a better target for the design of chemotherapeutic strategies. To this end, we screened expression on PKC isoforms in four human glioblastoma cell lines both when proliferating and in a quiescent state using western assays. PKC isoforms alpha, beta, betaII and zeta were found to be expressed in all cell lines. PKC epsilon was detected in three out of four cell lines and PKC eta was detected in one out of four cell lines. Quiescence of growth resulted in down-regulation of PKC epsilon. We examined the role of these isoforms by studying the effect of PKC isoform-specific inhibitors bisindolylmaleimide-I and Go6976 on proliferation in a panel of four human glioblastoma cell lines. Inhibition of PKC alpha and epsilon had no effect on proliferation, suggesting that previous studies targeting PKC alpha may not be of therapeutic benefit. More significantly, it was shown that inhibition of PKC zeta blocked proliferation. This suggests that the inhibition of PKC zeta may be an important chemotherapeutic target for arresting growth in glioblastoma.",

We found that KT6006 and KT6528, synthetic antitumor derivatives of indolocarbazole antibiotic K252a, were potent inducers of a cleavable complex with topoisomerase I. In DNA cleavage assay using purified calf thymus DNA topoisomerase I and supercoiled pBR322 DNA, KT6006 induced topoisomerase I mediated DNA cleavage in a dose-dependent manner at drug concentrations up to 50 microM, while DNA cleavage induced by KT6528 was saturated at 5 microM. The maximal amount of nicked DNA produced by KT6006 was more than 50% of substrate DNA, which was comparable to that of camptothecin. Heat treatment (65 degrees C) of the reaction mixture containing these compounds and topoisomerase I resulted in a substantial reduction in DNA cleavage, suggesting that topoisomerase I mediated DNA cleavage induced by KT6006 and KT6528 is through the mechanism of stabilizing the reversible enzyme-DNA \"cleavable complex\". Both KT6006 and KT6528 did not induce topoisomerase II mediated DNA cleavage in vitro. KT6006 and KT6528 were found to induce nearly identical topoisomerase I mediated DNA cleavage patterns, which was distinctly different from that with camptothecin. In contrast to the similarity between KT6006 and KT6528 in their structures and the nature of their cleavable complex with topoisomerase I, these drugs have different properties with respect to their interaction with DNA: KT6006 is a very weak intercalator whereas KT6528 is a strong intercalator with potentials comparable to that of adriamycin.

These models include an ex vivo measure of PDGFR-beta phosphorylation in glioblastoma tumors, a sponge model to measure inhibition of angiogenesis, and multiple models of tumor growth inhibition. Inhibition of PDGFR-beta phosphorylation in tumors correlates with plasma and tumor levels of CP-673,451.

This effect can be attributed mainly to a PDE III or a combined PDE III/IV inhibition since at the concentration of the maximal positive inotropic effect of isomazole, PDE III and PDE IV were completely inhibited. In explanted failing human hearts (end-stage myocardial failure, NYHA IV), isomazole increased the force of contraction only marginally to 110.1 +/- 10.7% of the predrug value. The lack of a distinct positive inotropic efficacy of isomazole in failing human hearts could not be explained by an impairment of PDE inhibition since the properties of the PDE I-IV isoenzymes separated by DEAE-Sepharose chromatography and the inhibitory effects of isomazole did not differ in both preparations. The positive inotropic effect of the beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoprenaline was also reduced in failing hearts. However, in the presence of isomazole, the diminished positive inotropic effect of isoprenaline was restored to values obtained with isoprenaline alone in nonfailing hearts. Thus, the decreased effect of inotropic drugs like isoprenaline or isomazole in preparations from failing human heart might be explained mainly by a diminished cAMP formation due to a defect in receptor-adenylate cyclase coupling.",

Our aim was to state whether such weight gain limitation could occur in non-obese, non-diabetic rats and to extend these observations to other amine oxidase inhibitors. Prolonged treatment of non-obese rats with a high dose of S (900 micromol kg(-1) day(-1)) reduced body weight gain and limited white adipose tissue enlargement. When chronically administered at a threefold lower dose, S also inhibited SSAO activity but not fat depot enlargement, suggesting that effects other than SSAO inhibition were involved in adipose tissue growth retardation. However, combined treatment of this lower dose of S with pargyline inhibited SSAO, MAO, energy intake, weight gain and fat deposition. Adipocytes from treated rats exhibited unchanged insulin responsiveness but impaired antilipolytic responses to amine oxidase substrates. Phenelzine clearly inhibited both MAO and SSAO when tested on adipocytes. Obese rats receiving phenelzine i.p. at 17 micromol kg(-1) day(-1) for 3 weeks, exhibited blunted MAO and SSAO activities in any tested tissue, diminished body weight gain and reduced intra-abdominal adipose tissue. Their adipocytes were less responsive to lipogenesis activation by tyramine or benzylamine. These observations suggest that SSAO inhibition is not sufficient to impair fat deposition.

In this study, we have developed an assay based on cell lines stably expressing mouse TRPV2 channels and intracellular calcium measurements to perform a pharmacological profiling of the channel. Phenyl borate derivatives were found to activate mouse TRPV2 with similar potencies and thus were used to screen a panel of channel blockers. Besides the classic TRP inhibitors ruthenium red (RR) and 1-(beta-[3-(4-methoxyphenyl) propoxy]-4-methoxyphenethyl)-1H-imidazole hydrochloride (SKF96365), two potassium channel blockers, tetraethylammonium (TEA) and 4-aminopyridine, and an inhibitor of capacitative calcium entry, 1-(2-(trifluoromethyl) phenyl) imidazole (TRIM), were found to inhibit TRPV2 activation by 100 microM 2APB. Activation by 300 microM 2APB, however, could only be inhibited by RR and TRIM. Electrophysiological recordings demonstrated that TEA inhibition was use-dependent, suggesting that high concentrations of 2APB might induce a progressive conformational change of the channel. Comparison of TRPV2 orthologs revealed that the human channel was insensitive to 2APB. Analysis of chimeric constructs of mouse and human TRPV2 channels showed that the molecular determinants of 2APB sensitivity could be localized to the intracellular amino and carboxyl domains. Finally, using lentiviral-driven expression, we demonstrate that hTRPV2 exerts a dominant-negative effect on 2APB activation of native rodent TRPV2 channels and thus may provide an interesting tool to investigate cellular functions of TRPV2 channels.",

A series of quinuclidine derivatives incorporating a tricyclic system was synthesized and evaluated for their ability to inhibit squalene synthase in vitro. A 9H-fluorene moiety was found to be optimal as the tricyclic system for potent inhibitory activity. Improved activity can be achieved with a conformationally constrained three-atom linkage connecting the tricyclic system with the quinuclidine nucleus. Among these compounds, (Z)-3-[2-(9H-fluoren-2-yloxy)ethylidene]-quinuclidine hydrochloride 31 was found to be a potent inhibitor of squalene synthase derived from hamster liver and human hepatoma cells with IC(50) values of 76 and 48 nM, respectively.

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Inhibition of steroid sulfatase (STS), the enzyme responsible for the hydrolysis of steroid sulfates, represents a potential novel treatment for postmenopausal women with hormone-dependent breast cancer. Estrone and DHEA are formed by this sulfatase pathway and can be converted to steroids (estradiol and androstenediol, respectively), which have potent estrogenic properties. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: STX64 (667 Coumate), a tricylic coumarin-based sulfamate that irreversibly inhibits STS activity, was selected for entry into the first phase I trial of a STS inhibitor in postmenopausal women with breast cancer. STX64 was administered orally (nine patients at 5 mg and five patients at 20 mg) as an initial dose followed 1 week later by 3 x 2 weekly cycles, with each cycle comprising daily dosing for 5 days followed by 9 days off treatment. Blood and tumor tissue samples were collected for the assessment of STS activity and serum was obtained for steroid hormone measurements before and after treatment. RESULTS: The median inhibition of STS activity by STX64 was 98% in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and 99% in breast tumor tissue at the end of the 5-day dosing period. As expected, serum concentrations of estrone, estradiol, androstenediol, and DHEA all decreased significantly from pretreatment levels. Unexpectedly, androstenedione and testosterone concentrations also decreased. Four patients, all of whom had previously progressed on aromatase inhibitors, showed evidence of stable disease for 2.75 to 7 months. The drug was well tolerated with only minor drug-related adverse events recorded. CONCLUSION: STX64 is a potent, well-tolerated STS inhibitor. It inhibits STS activity in PBLs and tumor tissues and causes significant decreases in serum concentrations of steroids with estrogenic properties.",

The present study was designed to examine whether cardiac depression induced by creatine kinase inhibition was due to action at the level of the essential contractile element, namely cardiomyocytes. Adult rat cardiomyocytes were perfused with the creatine kinase inhibitor iodoacetamide (90 micromol/L) for 90 min. Mechanical and intracellular Ca(2+) properties were evaluated using edge-detection and fluorescence microscopy, respectively. Myocytes were superfused with normal (1.3 mmol/L) or high (3.3 mmol/L) extracellular Ca(2+) contractile buffer. Mechanical function was examined, including peak shortening (PS), maximal velocity of shortening/relengthening (+/-dL/dt), time to 90% PS (TPS(90)), time to 90% relengthening (TR(90)) and integration of shortening/relengthening (normalized to PS). Intracellular Ca(2+) transients were evaluated using the following indices: resting and rise of fura-2 fluorescence intensity (Delta FFI) and intracellular Ca(2+) decay time constant. 3. The results indicate that elevated extracellular Ca(2+) stimulated cardiomyocyte positive inotrope, manifested as increased PS, +/-dL/dt, area of shortening, resting FFI and Delta FFI associated with a shortened TR(90) and intracellular Ca(2+) decay time constant. High extracellular Ca(2+) did not affect TPS(90) and area of relengthening. Iodoacetamide ablated high Ca(2+)-induced increases in PS, +/-dL/dt, area of shortening, resting FFI, Delta FFI and shortened TR(90) and intracellular Ca(2+) decay time constant. Iodoacetamide itself significantly enhanced the area of relengthening and TR(90) without affecting other indices. 4. Collectively, these data demonstrate that inhibition of creatine kinase blunts high extracellular Ca(2+)-induced increases in cardiomyocyte contractile response (i.e. cardiac contractile reserve).",

        "abstract": "The Janus-associated kinase 2 (JAK2) V617F mutation is believed to play a critical role in the pathogenesis of polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, and idiopathic myelofibrosis. We have characterized a novel small molecule JAK2 inhibitor, AZ960, and used it as a tool to investigate the consequences of JAK2 V617F inhibition in the SET-2 cell line. AZ960 inhibits JAK2 kinase with a K(i) of 0.00045 microm in vitro and treatment of TEL-JAK2 driven Ba/F3 cells with AZ960 blocked STAT5 phosphorylation and potently inhibited cell proliferation (GI(50)=0.025 microm). AZ960 demonstrated selectivity for TEL-JAK2-driven STAT5 phosphorylation and cell proliferation when compared with cell lines driven by similar fusions of the other JAK kinase family members. In the SET-2 human megakaryoblastic cell line, heterozygous for the JAK2 V617F allele, inhibition of JAK2 resulted in decreased STAT3/5 phosphorylation and inhibition of cell proliferation (GI(50)=0.033 microm) predominately through the induction of mitochondrial-mediated apoptosis. We provide evidence that JAK2 inhibition induces apoptosis by direct and indirect regulation of the anti-apoptotic protein BCL-xL. Inhibition of JAK2 blocked BCL-XL mRNA expression resulting in a reduction of BCL-xL protein levels. Additionally, inhibition of JAK2 resulted in decreased PIM1 and PIM2 mRNA expression. Decreased PIM1 mRNA corresponded with a decrease in Pim1 protein levels and inhibition of BAD phosphorylation at Ser(112). Finally, small interfering RNA-mediated suppression of BCL-xL resulted in apoptotic cell death similar to the phenotype observed following JAK2 inhibition. These results suggest a model in which JAK2 promotes cell survival by signaling through the Pim/BAD/BCL-xL pathway.",

This family of closely related analogs exerts a spectrum of effects, ranging from positive to negative allosteric modulation, and includes compounds that do not themselves modulate mGluR5 agonist activity but rather prevent other family members from exerting their modulatory effects. 3,3'-Difluorobenzaldazine (DFB) has no agonist activity, but it acts as a selective positive allosteric modulator of human and rat mGluR5. DFB potentiates threshold responses to glutamate, quisqualate, and 3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine in fluorometric Ca2+ assays 3- to 6-fold, with EC50 values in the 2 to 5 microM range, and at 10 to 100 microM, it shifts mGluR5 agonist concentration-response curves approximately 2-fold to the left. The analog 3,3'-dimethoxybenzaldazine (DMeOB) acts as a negative modulator of mGluR5 agonist activity, with an IC50 of 3 microM in fluorometric Ca2+ assays, whereas the analog 3,3'-dichlorobenzaldazine (DCB) does not exert any apparent modulatory effect on mGluR5 activity. However, DCB seems to act as an allosteric ligand with neutral cooperativity, preventing the positive allosteric modulation of mGluRs by DFB as well as the negative modulatory effect of DMeOB. None of these analogs affects binding of [3H]quisqualate to the orthosteric (glutamate) site, but they do inhibit [3H]3-methoxy-5-(2-pyridinylethynyl)pyridine binding to the site for 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)-pyridine, a previously identified negative allosteric modulator. With the use of these compounds, we provide evidence that allosteric sites on GPCRs can respond to closely related ligands with a range of pharmacological activities from positive to negative modulation as well as to neutral competition of this modulation.",

In the present study, EF1502 was found to possess a broad-spectrum anticonvulsant profile in animal models of generalized and partial epilepsy. When EF1502 was tested in combination with the clinically effective GAT1-selective inhibitor tiagabine [(R)-N-[4,4-bis(3-methyl-2-thienyl)-3-butenyl]nipecotic acid] or LU-32-176B [N-[4,4-bis(4-fluorophenyl)-butyl]-3-hydroxy-4-amino-4,5,6,7-tetrahydrobenzo[d]isoxazol-3-ol], another GAT1-selective N-substituted analog of exo-THPO, a synergistic rather than additive anticonvulsant interaction was observed in the Frings audiogenic seizure-susceptible mouse and the pentylenetetrazol seizure threshold test. In contrast, combination of the two mGAT1-selective inhibitors, tiagabine and LU-32-176B, resulted in only an additive anticonvulsant effect. Importantly, the combination of EF1502 and tiagabine did not result in a greater than additive effect in the rotarod behavioral impairment test. In subsequent in vitro studies conducted in HEK-293 cells expressing the cloned mouse GAT transporters mGAT1 and mGAT2, EF1502 was found to noncompetitively inhibit both mGAT1 and the betaine/GABA transporter mGAT2 (K(i) of 4 and 5 muM, respectively). Furthermore, in a GABA release study conducted in neocortical neurons, EF1502 did not act as a substrate for the GABA carrier. Collectively, these findings support a functional role for mGAT2 in the control of neuronal excitability and suggest a possible utility for mGAT2-selective inhibitors in the treatment of epilepsy.",

TAAR1 is considered a promising drug target for the treatment of psychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders. However, no selective ligand to identify TAAR1-specific signaling mechanisms is available yet. Here we report a selective TAAR1 antagonist, EPPTB, and characterize its physiological effects at dopamine (DA) neurons of the ventral tegmental area (VTA). We show that EPPTB prevents the reduction of the firing frequency of DA neurons induced by p-tyramine (p-tyr), a nonselective TAAR1 agonist. When applied alone, EPPTB increases the firing frequency of DA neurons, suggesting that TAAR1 either exhibits constitutive activity or is tonically activated by ambient levels of endogenous agonist(s). We further show that EPPTB blocks the TAAR1-mediated activation of an inwardly rectifying K(+) current. When applied alone, EPPTB induces an apparent inward current, suggesting the closure of tonically activated K(+) channels. Importantly, these EPPTB effects were absent in Taar1 knockout mice, ruling out off-target effects. We additionally found that both the acute application of EPPTB and the constitutive genetic lack of TAAR1 increase the potency of DA at D2 receptors in DA neurons. In summary, our data support that TAAR1 tonically activates inwardly rectifying K(+) channels, which reduces the basal firing frequency of DA neurons in the VTA. We hypothesize that the EPPTB-induced increase in the potency of DA at D2 receptors is part of a homeostatic feedback mechanism compensating for the lack of inhibitory TAAR1 tone.",

PYC exerted strong scavenging activities against reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated by H2O2 in RAW 264.7. In situ ELISA, immunoblot analysis, and competitive RT-PCR demonstrated that pretreatment of LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells with PYC dose-dependently reduced both the production of IL-1beta and its mRNA levels. Furthermore, in the same cells, PYC blocked the activation of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) and activator protein-1 (AP-1), two major transcription factors centrally involved in IL-1beta gene expression. Concordantly, pretreatment of the cells with PYC abolished the LPS-induced IkappaB degradation. We also investigated the effect of PYC on IL-2 gene expression in phorbol 12-myristate 13acetate plus ionomycin (PMA/Io)-stimulated human T-cell line Jurkat E6.1. PYC inhibited the PMA/Io-induced IL-2 mRNA expression. However, as demonstrated in a reporter gene assay system, the mechanism of IL-2 gene transcriptional regulation by PYC was different from the regulation of IL-1beta. PYC inhibited both NF-AT and AP-1 chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) activities in transiently transfected Jurkat E6.1, but not NF-kappaB CAT activity. We also found that PYC can destabilize PMA/Io-induced IL-2 mRNA by posttranscriptional regulation.

        "abstract": "1. The aims of the present study were to explore the protective effect of curcumin against the acute vascular endothelial dysfunction induced by high glucose and to investigate the possible role of heme oxygenase (HO)-1 in this protective action. 2. Thoracic aortic rings, with or without endothelium, obtained from male Sprague-Dawley rats were mounted in an organ bath. Isometric contraction of the rings was recorded. After completion of the organ bath studies, rings were homogenized and centrifuged (30,000 g, 4 degrees C, 15 min) and HO activity was determined in the supernatant. 3. After 2 h incubation of aortic rings in the presence of high glucose (44 mmol/L), the relaxation evoked by acetylcholine (3 x 10(-8) to 3 x 10(-5) mol/L) was significantly decreased only in rings with an intact endothelium. When rings were coincubated in the presence of curcumin (10(-13) to 10(-11) mol/L) and high glucose, curcumin reversed the vasodilator dysfunction induced by high glucose dose dependently. 4. Curcumin (10(-11) mol/L) increased HO activity in the aortic rings compared with activity in control rings (63.1 +/- 3.6 vs control 43.2 +/- 2.9 pmol/mg per h, respectively; P &lt; 0.01). Protoporphyrin IX zinc (10(-6) mol/L), an inhibitor of HO-1, offset the protective effects of curcumin. In addition, the non-selective guanylate cyclase (GC) inhibitor methylene blue (10(-6) mol/L) completely abolished the protective effects of curcumin. 5. In conclusion, the results of the present study show that curcumin alleviates the acute endothelium-dependent vasodilator dysfunction induced by high glucose in rat aortic rings. Increased HO-1 activity and stimulation of GC may be involved in the protective effects of curcumin.",

In the present study, the authors postulated that inhibition of myristoylated alanine-rich C kinase substrate (MARCKS), an 82-kDa protein with multiple biological roles, could inhibit ozone-induced leukocyte trafficking and cytokine secretions. BALB/c mice (n = 5/cohort) were exposed to ozone (100 ppb) or forced air (FA) for 4 hours. MARCKS-inhibiting peptides, MANS, BIO-11000, BIO-11006, or scrambled control peptide RNS, were intratracheally administered prior to ozone exposure. Ozone selectively enhanced bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) levels of killer cells (KCs; 6 +/- 0.9-fold), interleukin-6 (IL-6; 12.7 +/- 1.9-fold), and tumor necrosis factor (TNF; 2.1 +/- 0.5-fold) as compared to cohorts exposed to FA. Additionally, ozone increased BAL neutrophils by 21% +/- 2% with no significant (P &gt; .05) changes in other cell types. MANS, BIO-11000, and BIO-11006 significantly reduced ozone-induced KC secretion by 66% +/- 14%, 47% +/- 15%, and 71.1% +/- 14%, and IL-6 secretion by 69% +/- 12%, 40% +/- 7%, and 86.1% +/- 11%, respectively. Ozone-mediated increases in BAL neutrophils were reduced by MANS (86% +/- 7%) and BIO-11006 (84% +/- 2.5%), but not BIO-11000. These studies identify for the first time the novel potential of MARCKS protein inhibitors in abrogating ozone-induced increases in neutrophils, cytokines, and chemokines in BAL fluid.

We report the molecular pharmacology and antitumor activity of PHT-427, a compound designed to bind to the pleckstrin homology (PH) binding domain of signaling molecules important in cancer. Although originally designed to bind the PH domain of Akt, we now report that PHT-427 also binds to the PH domain of PDPK1. A series of PHT-427 analogues with variable C-4 to C-16 alkyl chain length were synthesized and tested. PHT-427 itself (C-12 chain) bound with the highest affinity to the PH domains of both PDPK1 and Akt. PHT-427 inhibited Akt and PDPK1 signaling and their downstream targets in sensitive but not resistant cells and tumor xenografts. When given orally, PHT-427 inhibited the growth of human tumor xenografts in immunodeficient mice, with up to 80% inhibition in the most sensitive tumors, and showed greater activity than analogues with C4, C6, or C8 alkyl chains. Inhibition of PDPK1 was more closely correlated to antitumor activity than Akt inhibition. Tumors with PIK3CA mutation were the most sensitive, and K-Ras mutant tumors were the least sensitive. Combination studies showed that PHT-427 has greater than additive antitumor activity with paclitaxel in breast cancer and with erlotinib in non-small cell lung cancer. When given &gt;5 days, PHT-427 caused no weight loss or change in blood chemistry.

Picropdophyllin (PPP, AXL1717) is a small-molecule inhibitor of the IGF-1R without inhibition of closely related receptors including the insulin receptor and has shown extensive effects against a wide range of tumors in animals. PPP is currently tested as an orally administrated single agent treatment in an open-label combined Phase I/II clinical study in advanced cancer patients with solid tumors which progress in spite of several lines of treatment. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The first part (Phase IA) consisted of single day BID dosing every three weeks with consecutive dose escalations. The second part (Phase IB) consists of seven days or longer BID dosing every three weeks, dosing range being 520-700 mg BID. Non-progressing patients could continue treatment within a compassionate use setting. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The present report describes our experience with the four patients with progressive squamous non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that have received treatment with PPP. Despite more than seven months of PPP treatment as third or fourth line treatment, the reported patients did not develop any additional metastases. Furthermore, CT scans as well as (18)FDG-Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scans of the patients demonstrated large central necrotic areas, which may suggest tumor response. At the same time, the study drug is so far well tolerated. The phenomenon of necrosis in the tumors suggestive of tumor response has not been reported before in anti-IGF-1R treatment and will be subject to further studies in the present clinical trial.",

However, chromatographic analyses of brain homogenate extracts taken 60 min pi showed that &gt;98% of radioactivity was unchanged radioligand. Chromatographic isolation and reinjection of peripherally formed radioactive metabolites revealed no accumulation of radioactivity in mouse brain, probably due to the polarity of the metabolites.

Mitogen-activated protein kinase-activated protein kinase 2 (MK2), a direct downstream substrate of p38 kinase, regulates lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) and interleukin-6 (IL-6) production through modulating the stability and translation of these mRNAs. Developing small-molecule inhibitors of MK2 may yield anti-inflammatory efficacy with a different safety profile relative to p38 kinase inhibitors. This article describes the pharmacologic properties of a benzothiophene MK2 inhibitor, PF-3644022 [(10R)-10-methyl-3-(6-methylpyridin-3-yl)-9,10,11,12-tetrahydro-8H-[1,4]diazepino[5',6':4,5]thieno[3,2-f]quinolin-8-one]. PF-3644022 is a potent freely reversible ATP-competitive compound that inhibits MK2 activity (K(i) = 3 nM) with good selectivity when profiled against 200 human kinases. In the human U937 monocytic cell line or peripheral blood mononuclear cells, PF-3644022 potently inhibits TNFalpha production with similar activity (IC(50) = 160 nM). PF-3644022 blocks TNFalpha and IL-6 production in LPS-stimulated human whole blood with IC(50) values of 1.6 and 10.3 microM, respectively. Inhibition of TNFalpha in U937 cells and blood correlates closely with inhibition of phospho-heat shock protein 27, a target biomarker of MK2 activity. PF-3644022 displays good pharmacokinetic parameters in rats and is orally efficacious in both the rat acute LPS-induced TNFalpha model and the chronic streptococcal cell wall-induced arthritis model. Dose-dependent inhibition of TNFalpha production in the acute model and inhibition of paw swelling in the chronic model is observed with ED(50) values of 6.9 and 20 mg/kg, respectively. PF-3644022 efficacy in the chronic inflammation model is strongly correlated with maintaining a C(min) higher than the EC(50) measured in the rat LPS-induced TNFalpha model.",

We determine that AM211 has high affinity for human, mouse, rat, and guinea pig DP2 and it shows selectivity over other prostanoid receptors and enzymes. Antagonist activity of AM211 at the DP2 receptor was confirmed by inhibition of PGD(2)-stimulated guanosine 5'-O-[gamma-thio]triphosphate binding to membranes expressing human DP2. A basophil activation assay and a whole-blood assay of eosinophil shape change were used to demonstrate the ability of AM211 to potently antagonize PGD(2)-stimulated functional responses in relevant human cells and in the context of a physiologically relevant environment. AM211 exhibits good oral bioavailability in rats and dogs and dose-dependently inhibits 13,14-dihydro-15-keto-PGD(2)-induced leukocytosis in a guinea pig pharmacodynamic assay. AM211 demonstrates efficacy in two animal models of allergic inflammation, including an ovalbumin-induced lung inflammation model in guinea pigs and an ovalbumin-induced mouse model of allergic rhinitis.

Since the small molecule isatin is a natural reversible inhibitor of both MAO-B and MAO-A, (E)-5-styrylisatin and (E)-6-styrylisatin analogues were synthesized in an attempt to identify inhibitors with enhanced potencies and specificities for MAO-B. The (E)-styrylisatin analogues were found to exhibit higher binding affinities than isatin with the MAO preparations tested. The (E)-5-styrylisatin analogues bound more tightly than the (E)-6 analogue although the latter exhibits the highest MAO-B selectivity. Molecular docking studies with MAO-B indicate that the increased binding affinity exhibited by the (E)-styrylisatin analogues, in comparison to isatin, is best explained by the ability of the styrylisatins to bridge both the entrance cavity and the substrate cavity of the enzyme. Experimental support for this model is shown by the weaker binding of the analogues to the Ile199Ala mutant of human MAO-B. The lower selectivity of the (E)-styrylisatin analogues between MAO-A and MAO-B, in contrast to CSC, is best explained by the differing relative geometries of the aromatic rings for these two classes of inhibitors.",

High affinity of CEP-26401 for H3R was demonstrated in radioligand binding displacement assays in rat brain membranes (K(i) = 2.7 +- 0.3 nM) and recombinant rat and human H3R-expressing systems (K(i) = 7.2 +- 0.4 and 2.0 +- 1.0 nM, respectively). CEP-26401 displayed potent antagonist and inverse agonist activities in [35S]guanosine 5'-O-(gamma-thio)triphosphate binding assays. After oral dosing of CEP-26401, occupancy of H3R was estimated by the inhibition of ex vivo binding in rat cortical slices (OCC50 = 0.1 +- 0.003 mg/kg), and antagonism of the H3R agonist R-alpha-methylhistamine- induced drinking response in the rat dipsogenia model was demonstrated in a similar dose range (ED50 = 0.06 mg/kg). CEP-26401 improved performance in the rat social recognition model of short-term memory at doses of 0.01 to 0.1 mg/kg p.o. and was wake-promoting at 3 to 30 mg/kg p.o. In DBA/2NCrl mice, CEP-26401 at 10 and 30 mg/kg i.p. increased prepulse inhibition (PPI), whereas the antipsychotic risperidone was effective at 0.3 and 1 mg/kg i.p. Coadministration of CEP-26401 and risperidone at subefficacious doses (3 and 0.1 mg/kg i.p., respectively) increased PPI. These results demonstrate potent behavioral effects of CEP-26401 in rodent models and suggest that this novel H3R antagonist may have therapeutic utility in the treatment of cognitive and attentional disorders. CEP-26401 may also have therapeutic utility in treating schizophrenia or as adjunctive therapy to approved antipsychotics.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Many cells express proteinase activated receptor 2 (PAR2) on their plasma membrane. PAR2 is activated by proteolytic enzymes, such as trypsin and tryptase that cleave the receptor N-terminus, inititating signalling to intracellular G proteins. Studies on PAR2 have relied heavily upon activating effects of proteases and peptide agonists that lack stability and bioavailability in vivo. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: A novel small molecule agonist GB110 and an antagonist GB88 were characterized in vitro against trypsin, peptide agonists, PAR2 antibody, PAR1 agonists and flow cytometry,in seven cell lines using intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization and examined in vivo against PAR2- and PAR1-induced rat paw oedema. KEY RESULTS: GB110 is a potent non-peptidic agonist activating PAR2-mediated Ca(2+) release in HT29 cells (EC(50) ~200 nM) and six other human cell lines, inducing PAR2 internalization. GB88 is a unique PAR2 antagonist, inhibiting PAR2 activated Ca(2+) release (IC(50) ~2 microM) induced by native (trypsin) or synthetic peptide and non-peptide agonists. GB88 was a competitive and surmountable antagonist of agonist 2f-LIGRLO-NH(2), a competitive but insurmountable antagonist of agonist GB110, and a non-competitive insurmountable antagonist of trypsin. GB88 was orally active and anti-inflammatory in vivo, inhibiting acute rat paw oedema elicited by agonist GB110 and proteolytic or peptide agonists of PAR2 but not by corresponding agonists of PAR1 or PAR4. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The novel PAR2 agonist and antagonist modulate intracellular Ca(2+) and rat paw oedema, providing novel molecular tools for examining PAR2-mediated diseases.",

(2011) ACS Med. Chem. Lett. 2, 402-406]. N6022 is currently in early phase clinical studies in humans. We show here that N6022 is a tight-binding, specific, and fully reversible inhibitor of GSNOR with an IC(50) of 8 nM and a K(i) of 2.5 nM. We accounted for the fact that the NAD(+)- and NADH-dependent oxidation and reduction reactions, catalyzed by GSNOR are bisubstrate in nature in our calculations. N6022 binds in the GSNO substrate binding pocket like a competitive inhibitor, although in kinetic assays it behaves with a mixed uncompetitive mode of inhibition (MOI) toward the GSNO substrate and a mixed competitive MOI toward the formaldehyde adduct, S-hydroxymethylglutathione (HMGSH).

We conducted a phase I dose-finding and pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic study of BIIB028, a prodrug designed to inhibit Hsp90 activity. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Patients with advanced solid tumors were enrolled and received escalating doses of BIIB028 intravenously twice a week in 21-day cycles (3+3 design). Response was evaluated after two cycles. RESULTS: Forty-one patients received doses of 6 to 192 mg/m2. The maximum tolerated dose was 144 mg/m2. Dose-limiting toxicities were syncope (n=1) and fatigue (n=1). Common toxicities at least possibly related to drug were grades 1 to 2, including fatigue (46%), diarrhea (44%), nausea (44%), vomiting (29%), hot flushes (29%), and abnormal dreams (17%). The concentration-time curves for day 1 and day 18 for both prodrug and active metabolite (CF2772) showed a negligible difference. There was a dose-dependent increase in plasma exposure for BIIB028 (CF3647) and CF2772 with plasma half-life of 0.5 and 2.1 hours, respectively. Pharmacodynamic analyses showed significant increases in Hsp70 in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and significantly decreased circulating human EGF receptor-2 extracellular domain in all patients who received BIIB028 at dose levels of 48 mg/m2 or more. Stable disease for at least eight cycles (24 weeks) was achieved in 5 (12%) patients (for durations of 6, 6, 8, 12.5, and 19 months). CONCLUSION: BIIB028 is a well-tolerated molecule that showed target impact and was associated with prolonged stable disease in two patients.",

        "abstract": "Neointima formation associated with vascular restenosis is a complex local inflammatory process actively involving the vascular smooth muscle cell (SMC) proliferation. Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) is a transactivator of a diverse group of genes whose activation has been strongly associated with the cellular response to inflammation. Since anti-oxidant N-acetylcysteine (NAC) inhibit NF-kappaB activity in vascular SMC in vitro, we examined the in vivo effect of the NAC on balloon-induced neointimal formation in the carotid artery of rats. Sprague-Dawley rats underwent balloon dilatation injury of the left carotid artery to induce neointimal formation. One group of these rats (n = 9) were treated with daily intraperitoneal injection of NAC (200 mg kg(-1)) for 14 consecutive days, whereas the control group (n = 9) was treated with saline. Fourteen days after the injury, the left carotid arteries were removed and analyzed under microscope. Several rats underwent the same treatment as above and were sacrificed three days after injury for immunohistochemistry and Western blot studies. A morphometric analysis revealed that there were significant differences in intima/media ratio between the two groups. Immunohistochemical and Western blotting studies demonstrated that NAC suppressed the injury-induced NF-kappaB activity in the medial SMC layer. Treatment with NAC suppresses vascular NF-kappaB activation and this inhibition reduced the pathological thickening of the arterial wall. The NF-kappaB pathway, therefore, represents an attractive therapeutic target for strategies to prevent vascular restenosis.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Abolishing the inhibitory signal of intracellular cAMP by phosphodiesterases (PDEs) is a prerequisite for effector T (Teff) cell function. While PDE4 plays a prominent role, its control of cAMP levels in Teff cells is not exclusive. T cell activation has been shown to induce PDE8, a PDE isoform with 40- to 100-fold greater affinity for cAMP than PDE4. Thus, we postulated that PDE8 is an important regulator of Teff cell functions. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We found that Teff cells express PDE8 in vivo. Inhibition of PDE8 by the PDE inhibitor dipyridamole (DP) activates cAMP signaling and suppresses two major integrins involved in Teff cell adhesion. Accordingly, DP as well as the novel PDE8-selective inhibitor PF-4957325-00 suppress firm attachment of Teff cells to endothelial cells. Analysis of downstream signaling shows that DP suppresses proliferation and cytokine expression of Teff cells from Crem-/- mice lacking the inducible cAMP early repressor (ICER). Importantly, endothelial cells also express PDE8. DP treatment decreases vascular adhesion molecule and chemokine expression, while upregulating the tight junction molecule claudin-5. In vivo, DP reduces CXCL12 gene expression as determined by in situ probing of the mouse microvasculature by cell-selective laser-capture microdissection.

Due to lack of selectivity of AChE inhibitor drugs on the market, AD-patients suffer from side effects like nausea or vomiting. In the present study the isolation of two alkaloids, infractopicrin (1) and 10-hydroxy-infractopicrin (2), from Cortinarius infractus Berk. (Cortinariaceae) is presented. Both compounds show AChE-inhibiting activity and possess a higher selectivity than galanthamine. Docking studies show that lacking pi-pi-interactions in butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) are responsible for selectivity. Studies on other AD pathology related targets show an inhibitory effect of both compounds on self-aggregation of Abeta-peptides but not on AChE induced Abeta-peptide aggregation. Low cytotoxicity as well as calculated pharmacokinetic data suggest that the natural products could be useful candidates for further drug development.",

        "abstract": "The selective phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitor AWD 12-281 is structurally optimized for topical administration. It has potent effects in models of lung inflammation if administered as a dry powder inhalation. It has also demonstrated its anti-inflammatory property in a mouse model of cutaneous inflammation after topical administration. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether AWD 12-281 may be capable of penetrating human skin. Therefore a new guinea-pig model of allergic skin inflammation had to be developed. In ovalbumin-sensitized guinea-pigs, intracutaneous administration of ovalbumin results in a rapid development of allergic skin wheals. Topically administered AWD 12-281 was capable of reducing the development of wheals, indicating that this compound can penetrate the stratum corneum of guinea-pig skin as a predictor of human skin penetration. A secondary aim was the evaluation of a T cell subtype preference of AWD 12-281 since PDE4 inhibitors are said to preferentially inhibit Th2-type cytokines. Therefore, the effects of AWD 12-281 on a broad spectrum of Th1- and Th2-type cytokines were studied in tissue homogenates after allergen challenge in sensitized mice and in supernatants of anti CD3/anti-CD28-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). In both models, AWD 12-281 suppressed both T cell subtype cytokines indicating a broad spectrum activity of AWD 12-281. A further issue was to determine the duration of action and the concentration-response relationship of the topical activity of AWD 12-281 using a model of acute local inflammation--the arachidonic-acid-induced mouse ear oedema. The compound exhibited a dose-dependent effect with a minimally effective concentration of 0.3%; after repeated administration the minimally effective concentration was found to be 0.03%. A single administration of a 3% solution resulted in significant suppression of inflammation even 48 h after treatment. In conclusion, our results indicate that AWD 12-281 is a very promising drug candidate not only for the treatment of lung inflammation using inhalative administration but also for the treatment of atopic dermatitis.",

More recent drug discovery efforts identified 3-((1S,2S)-2-hydroxycyclohexyl)-6-((6-(1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-4-yl)pyridin-3-yl)methyl)benzo[h]quinazolin-4(3H)-one (referred to herein as benzoquinazolinone 12) as a more potent M1 mAChR PAM with a structural ancestry originating from BQCA and related compounds. In the current study, we optimized the synthesis of and fully characterized the pharmacology of benzoquinazolinone 12, finding that its improved potency derived from a 50-fold increase in allosteric site affinity as compared with BQCA, while retaining a similar level of positive cooperativity with acetylcholine. We then utilized site-directed mutagenesis and molecular modeling to validate the allosteric binding pocket we previously described for BQCA as a shared site for benzoquinazolinone 12 and provide a molecular basis for its improved activity at the M1 mAChR. This includes a key role for hydrophobic and polar interactions with residues Tyr-179, in the second extracellular loop (ECL2) and Trp-400(7.35) in transmembrane domain (TM) 7. Collectively, this study highlights how the properties of affinity and cooperativity can be differentially modified on a common structural scaffold and identifies molecular features that can be exploited to tailor the development of M1 mAChR-targeting PAMs.",

        "abstract": "Insulin-degrading enzyme (IDE, insulysin) is the best characterized catabolic enzyme implicated in proteolysis of insulin. Recently, a peptide inhibitor of IDE has been shown to affect levels of insulin, amylin, and glucagon in vivo. However, IDE(-/-) mice display variable phenotypes relating to fasting plasma insulin levels, glucose tolerance, and insulin sensitivity depending on the cohort and age of animals. Here, we interrogated the importance of IDE-mediated catabolism on insulin clearance in vivo. Using a structure-based design, we linked two newly identified ligands binding at unique IDE exosites together to construct a potent series of novel inhibitors. These compounds do not interact with the catalytic zinc of the protease. Because one of these inhibitors (NTE-1) was determined to have pharmacokinetic properties sufficient to sustain plasma levels &gt;50 times its IDE IC50 value, studies in rodents were conducted. In oral glucose tolerance tests with diet-induced obese mice, NTE-1 treatment improved the glucose excursion. Yet in insulin tolerance tests and euglycemic clamp experiments, NTE-1 did not enhance insulin action or increase plasma insulin levels. Importantly, IDE inhibition with NTE-1 did result in elevated plasma amylin levels, suggesting the in vivo role of IDE action on amylin may be more significant than an effect on insulin. Furthermore, using the inhibitors described in this report, we demonstrate that in HEK cells IDE has little impact on insulin clearance. In total, evidence from our studies supports a minimal role for IDE in insulin metabolism in vivo and suggests IDE may be more important in helping regulate amylin clearance.",

        "abstract": "SphK (sphingosine kinase) is the major source of the bioactive lipid and GPCR (G-protein-coupled receptor) agonist S1P (sphingosine 1-phosphate). S1P promotes cell growth, survival and migration, and is a key regulator of lymphocyte trafficking. Inhibition of S1P signalling has been proposed as a strategy for treatment of inflammatory diseases and cancer. In the present paper we describe the discovery and characterization of PF-543, a novel cell-permeant inhibitor of SphK1. PF-543 inhibits SphK1 with a K(i) of 3.6 nM, is sphingosine-competitive and is more than 100-fold selective for SphK1 over the SphK2 isoform. In 1483 head and neck carcinoma cells, which are characterized by high levels of SphK1 expression and an unusually high rate of S1P production, PF-543 decreased the level of endogenous S1P 10-fold with a proportional increase in the level of sphingosine. In contrast with past reports that show that the growth of many cancer cell lines is SphK1-dependent, specific inhibition of SphK1 had no effect on the proliferation and survival of 1483 cells, despite a dramatic change in the cellular S1P/sphingosine ratio. PF-543 was effective as a potent inhibitor of S1P formation in whole blood, indicating that the SphK1 isoform of sphingosine kinase is the major source of S1P in human blood. PF-543 is the most potent inhibitor of SphK1 described to date and it will be useful for dissecting specific roles of SphK1-driven S1P signalling.",

        "title": "Steroid derivatives as pure antagonists of the androgen receptor.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: While the androgens of testicular origin (representing about 50% of total androgens in men over 50 years) can be completely eliminated by surgical or medical castration with GnRH (gonadotropin-releasing hormone) agonists or antagonists, the antiandrogens currently available as blockers of androgen binding to the androgen receptor (AR), namely bicalutamide (BICA), flutamide (FLU) and nilutamide have too weak affinity to completely neutralize the other 50% of androgens made locally from dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) in the prostate cancer tissue by the mechanisms of intracrinology. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Series of steroid derivatives having pure and potent antagonistic activity on the human and rodent AR were synthesized. Assays of AR binding and activity in carcinoma mouse Shionogi and human LNCaP cells as well as in vivo bioavailability measurements and in vivo prostate weight assays in the rat were used. RESULTS: The chosen lead steroidal compound, namely EM-5854, has a 3.7-fold higher affinity than BICA for the human AR while EM-5855, an important metabolite of EM-5854, has a 94-fold higher affinity for the human AR compared to BICA. EM-5854 and EM-5855 are 14 times more potent than BICA in inhibiting androgen (R1881)-stimulated prostatic specific antigen (PSA) secretion in human prostatic carcinoma LNCaP cells in vitro. MDV3100 has a potency comparable to bicalutamide in these assays. Depending upon the oral formulation, EM-5854 is 5- to 10-times more potent than BICA to inhibit dihydrotestosterone (DHT)-stimulated ventral prostatic weight in vivo in the rat while MDV3100 has lower activity than BICA in this in vivo model. These data are supported by respective 40-fold and 105-fold higher potencies of EM-5854 and EM-5855 compared to BICA to inhibit cell proliferation in the androgen-sensitive Shionogi carcinoma cell model. CONCLUSIONS: Although the present preclinical results data need evaluation in clinical trials in men, combination of the data obtained in vitro in human LNCaP cells as indicator of potency in the human prostate and the data on metabolism evaluated in vivo on ventral prostate weight in the rat, could suggest the possibility of a 70- to 140-fold higher potency of EM-5854 compared to bicalutamide (Casodex) for the treatment of prostate cancer in men.",

        "abstract": "Withdrawal of estrogen represents the primary factor determining post menopausal bone loss and has been associated with negative indicators of bone quality including the apoptotic death of osteocytes in vivo. While hormone replacement therapy in the form of Estrogen or Selective Estrogen Receptor Modulators (SERMs) demonstrates clear estrogen receptor (ER)-mediated benefits to bone mass, less is known regarding the mechanism of action of these compounds in the maintenance of bone cell populations. We have investigated the potential antioxidant effects of estrogen, estrogen derivatives and the SERMs Raloxifene and LY117018 in the prevention of oxidative stress induced apoptosis in the osteocyte like cell line MLO-Y4. Treatment of MLO-Y4 with 0.3 mM H(2)O(2) induced apoptosis that was significantly inhibited (p&lt; or =0.002) when the cells were pre-treated for 1 h with either 17beta-estradiol, Raloxifene or LY117018 (10 nM). The stereoisomer 17alpha-estradiol also prevented H(2)O(2) induced apoptosis in MLO-Y4. Importantly, pre-treatment of ER-negative HEK293 cells with either 1 microM, 100 nM or 10 nM 17beta-estradiol, Raloxifene or LY117018 significantly inhibited H(2)O(2) induced apoptosis in these cells (p&lt; or =4.2x10(-5)) indicating an estrogen receptor-independent effect of these compounds. Comparisons of 17beta-estradiol and similar molecules containing the putative free radical scavenger C3-OH moiety on the steroid A-ring (17alpha-estradiol, 17alpha-ethinylestradiol; 10 nM) with structurally related molecules lacking the C3-OH grouping (Mestranol and Quinestrol; 10 nM) demonstrated that only compounds containing the C3-OH moiety showed anti-apoptotic behavior in these studies (p&lt; or =0.0033). Similarly the identification of the presence of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in cells as evidenced by the free radical indicator 2'7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate demonstrated that 17beta-estradiol, SERMs and related molecules with C3-OH moiety were capable of blocking ROS generated in cells by H(2)O(2) (p&lt; or =0.002) while Mestranol and Quinestrol showed no such blockade. It is possible that the loss of osteocytes during estrogen insufficiency may occur through a failure to suppress the activity of naturally occurring or disease associated oxidant molecules. These data suggest that the osteocyte protective effects of estrogen and SERMs may operate through a common receptor-independent mechanism which may be related to the antioxidant activity of these molecules.",

        "abstract": "Trichostatin A (TSA) and trapoxin (TPX), inhibitors of the eukaryotic cell cycle and inducers of morphological reversion of transformed cells, inhibit histone deacetylase (HDAC) at nanomolar concentrations. Recently, FK228 (also known as FR901228 and depsipeptide) and MS-275. antitumor agents structurally unrelated to TSA, have been shown to be potent HDAC inhibitors. These inhibitors activate the expression of p21Waf1 in a p53-independent manner. Changes in the expression of regulators of the cell cycle, differentiation, and apoptosis with increased histone acetylation may be responsible for the cell cycle arrest and antitumor activity of HDAC inhibitors. TSA has been suggested to block the catalytic reaction by chelating a zinc ion in the active site pocket through its hydroxamic acid group. On the other hand, an epoxyketone has been suggested to be the functional group of TPX capable of alkylating the enzyme. We synthesized a novel TPX analogue containing a hydroxamic acid instead of the epoxyketone. The hybrid compound, called cyclic hydroxamic-acid-containing peptide 1 (CHAP1) inhibited HDAC at low nanomolar concentrations. The HDAC1 inhibition by CHAPI was reversible, as is that by TSA, in contrast to irreversible inhibition by TPX. Interestingly, HDAC6, but not HDAC1 or HDAC4, was resistant to TPX and CHAP1, while TSA inhibited these HDACs to a similar degree. CHAP31, the strongest HDAC inhibitor obtained from a variety of CHAP derivatives, exhibited antitumor activity in BDF1 mice bearing B16/BL6 tumor cells. These results suggest that CHAP31 is promising as a novel therapeutic agent for cancer treatment, and that CHAP may serve as a basis for new HDAC inhibitors and be useful for combinatorial synthesis and high-throughput screening.",

These compounds were also found to inhibit the incorporation of [14C]acetate into sterols in cultured Hep G2 cells with an IC50 of 3 microM. New kinetic evidence indicated that inhibition of the isolated enzyme was irreversible. In contrast, sterol biosynthesis in cultured Hep G2 cells was rapidly restored upon removal of the compound from the medium of inhibited cultures, suggesting reversibility of inhibition in the cells. Radioactivity was found to be associated with a single cytoplasmic protein by SDS/PAGE of the cytoplasm of Hep G2 cells after incubation of the cells with the inhibitor 3H-L-668,411. This protein was identified as cytoplasmic HMG-CoA synthase. Binding of the radioactive compound to the enzyme was decreased with time if the radioactive inhibitor was removed from the medium. Exposure of a gel containing the radioactive enzyme-inhibitor complex to neutral hydroxylamine also resulted in a loss of radioactivity from the gel. The purified rat liver enzyme reacted with the 3H-ligand to form a stable enzyme-inhibitor complex which could be isolated by h.p.l.c. Radioactivity was also subsequently lost from this complex when it was incubated with neutral hydroxylamine. Incorporation of [14C]acetate into cholesterol in mouse liver was inhibited in a reversible manner after oral administration of the beta-lactone inhibitor.

        "abstract": "Little is known about the pharmacology or cell biology of human bombesin (Bn) receptors, because they are usually present at low levels and both subtypes are frequently present in the same tissues. Human gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) receptors (huGRP-R) and human neuromedin B (NMB) receptors (huNMB-R) were stably transfected into BALB/3T3 fibroblasts. Both receptor types were glycosylated, with 35% of the huGRP-R and 38% of the huNMB-R representing carbohydrate residues. The extent of glycosylation of the transfected huGRP-R was the same as that seen in the human glioblastoma cell line U-118. Radiolabeled agonist ligands were rapidly internalized, whereas noninternalized ligand readily dissociated in a temperature-dependent fashion. The affinities of various agonists for binding to the huGRP-R were Bn (Ki = 1.4 +/- 0.2 nM) = 4 x GRP = 300 x NMB. In contrast, affinities for the huNMB-R were NMB (Ki = 8.1 +/- 5.2 nM) = 4 x Bn = 600 x GRP. [F5-D-Phe6,D-Ala11]Bn(6-13)methyl ester was the most potent huGRP-R antagonist, whereas D-Nal-Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Lys-Val-Cys-Nal-NH2 was the most potent huNMB-R antagonist. Agonist binding to either receptor type caused activation of phospholipase C and increased cellular [3H]inositol phosphate levels. GRP was potent at increasing [3H]inositol phosphate generation in cells expressing the huGRP-R (EC50 = 13.6 +/- 1.3 nM), whereas NMB was similarly potent when acting upon cells expressing the huNMB-R (EC50 = 9.3 +/- 1.4 nM). However, neither receptor type, when stimulated with agonist, caused an increase in cAMP levels. These data show that stably transfected huGRP-R exhibit similar pharmacology for agonists and antagonists, are appropriately glycosylated, and function similarly with respect to their ability to alter biological activity, compared with natively expressed receptors. Minimal native huNMB-R data are available for comparison, but in general the huNMB-R is similar to the rat NMB receptor in its pharmacology and cell biology.",

The activity of both native and oncogenic ras proteins requires a series of post-translational processing steps.

Inhibitors of FTase are potential candidates for development as antitumor agents. Through a high-volume screening program, the pentapeptide derivative PD083176 (1), Cbz-His-Tyr(OBn)-Ser(OBn)-Trp-DAla-NH2, was identified as an inhibitor of rat brain FTase, with an IC50 of 20 nM.

This investigation led to a series of potent FTase inhibitors which lack a cysteine residue as found in the ras peptide substrate. The parent compound (1) inhibited the insulin-induced maturation of Xenopus oocytes (concentration: 5 pmol/oocyte), a process which is dependent on the activation of the ras pathway.",

        "abstract": "Over 80% of clinically manifested prostate cancers respond to androgen withdrawal. Several alternatives to castration have been explored. Since a growth promoting role for androstenedione has been suggested, we investigated the effect of inhibition of 3 beta-hydroxy-steroid-dehydrogenase (3 beta-HSD), a key enzyme involved in the biosynthesis of practically all steroids. In a previous study a reduced proliferation rate of androgen responsive R3327-H tumor was demonstrated after in vivo treatment with 17 beta-N,N-diethylcarbamoyl-4-aza-5 alpha-androstan-3-one (4MA) - a putative 5 alpha-reductase inhibitor. In the present investigation 3 beta-HSD enzyme activity derived from human placenta, testis and ovarian cancer cell line and from rat testis was determined using radiolabeled dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) or pregnenolone. Among different synthetic compounds known to interfere with steroidogenesis, only 4MA was shown to potently inhibit in vitro 3 beta-HSD activity from all tissue sources. 4MA was administered to male Copenhagen rats bearing R3327-H androgen dependent prostate tumors and levels of different androgens in serum and prostate tumor were measured using reversed phase HPLC and radioimmunoassay. The decreased content of androstenedione in serum and tumor tissue with DHEA accumulation in prostate tumor tissue showed an effective 3 beta-HSD inhibition by 4MA occurring in vivo as well. These observations unequivocally demonstrate a 3 beta-HSD inhibiting effect of 4MA in vitro as well as in vivo and point to a role for androstenedione in the promotion of cell proliferation in androgen sensitive tumors. 3 beta-HSD dependent androstenedione production could thus constitute a proper target -eventually combined with other endocrine treatment - for the treatment of hormone dependent prostate cancer.",

We investigated the effects of IBAT inhibition on the maintenance of serum cholesterol level by using a novel IBAT inhibitor, S-8921, in rabbits. Administration of S-8921 by its incorporation into the diet (0.01% to 0.1%) for 1 to 2 weeks in heterozygous Watanabe heritable hyperlipidemic rabbits decreased serum cholesterol by 29% to 37% and increased fecal excretion of measured bile acids by 60% to 180% compared with control rabbits. Liver microsomal cholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase activities were increased by 75% to 84% and 84% to 89%, respectively, with S-8921 treatment. S-8921 administration (0.1% in the diet) to normal New Zealand White rabbits for 2 weeks resulted in increased hepatic low density lipoprotein receptor expression, which was assessed by Northern blot analysis. In cholesterol-fed New Zealand White rabbits, S-8921 treatment (0.003% to 0.1% in the diet) for 10 weeks dose-dependently inhibited the development of hypercholesterolemia. It also inhibited the accumulation of cholesterol in the aortic arch and reduced the severity of coronary atherosclerosis. These results indicate that IBAT inhibition by S-8921 affects serum cholesterol, liver enzymes, low density lipoprotein receptor activity, and atherosclerosis in the same manner as bile acid sequestrants.

The HOMO-LUMO and docking results indicated the prominent role of aryl sulphonamide in CG100649. The aryl sulphonamide moiety formed T-shaped Pi...Pi interactions with His94 in the CA-II active site, which was not observed in the case of celecoxib.

        "abstract": "1 The haeme-containing soluble guanylyl cyclase (alpha1beta1-heterodimer) is a major intracellular receptor and effector for nitric oxide (NO) and carbon monoxide (CO) and mediates many of their biological actions by increasing cyclic GMP. We have synthesized new oxadiazolo-benz-oxazins and have assessed their inhibitory actions on guanylyl cyclase activity in vitro, on the formation of cyclic GMP in cultured cells and on the NO-dependent relaxation of vascular and non-vascular smooth muscle. 2 Soluble guanylyl cyclase, purified to homogeneity from bovine lung, was inhibited by 4H-8-bromo-1,2,4-oxadiazolo(3,4-d)benz(b)(1,4)oxazin-1-one (NS 2028) in a concentration-dependent and irreversible manner (IC50 30 nM for basal and 200 nM for NO-stimulated enzyme activity). Evaluation of the inhibition kinetics according to Kitz &amp; Wilson yielded a value of 8 nM for Ki, the equilibrium constant describing the initial reversible reaction between inhibitor and enzyme, and 0.2 min(-1) for the rate constant k3 of the subsequent irreversible inhibition. Inhibition was accompanied by a shift in the soret absorption maximum of the enzyme's haem cofactor from 430 to 390 nm. 3 S-nitroso-glutathione-enhanced soluble guanylyl cyclase activity in homogenates of mouse cerebellum was inhibited by NS 2028 (IC50 17 nM) and by 17 structural analogues in a similar manner, albeit with different potency, depending on the type of substitution at positions 1, 7 and 8 of the benzoxazin structure. Small electronegative ligands such as Br and Cl at position 7 or 8 increased and substitution of the oxygen at position 1 by -S-,- NH- or -CH2- decreased the inhibition. 4 In tissue slices prepared from mouse cerebellum, neuronal NO synthase-dependent activation of soluble guanylyl cyclase by the glutamate receptor agonist N-methyl-D-aspartate was inhibited by NS 2028 (IC50 20 nM) and by two of its analogues. Similarly, 3-morpholino-sydnonimine (SIN-1)-elicited formation of cyclic GMP in human cultured umbilical vein endothelial cells was inhibited by NS 2028 (IC50 30 nM). 5 In prostaglandin F2alpha-constricted, endothelium-intact porcine coronary arteries NS 2028 elicited a concentration-dependent increase (65%) in contractile tone (EC50 170 nM), which was abolished by removal of the endothelium. NS 2028 (1 microM) suppressed the relaxant response to nitroglycerin from 88.3+/-2.1 to 26.8+/-6.4% and induced a 9 fold rightward shift (EC50 15 microM) of the concentration-relaxation response curve to nitroglycerin. It abolished the relaxation to sodium nitroprusside (1 microM), but did not affect the vasorelaxation to the KATP channel opener cromakalim. Approximately 50% of the relaxant response to sodium nitroprusside was recovered after 2 h washout of NS 2028. 6 In phenylephrine-preconstricted, endothelium-denuded aorta of the rabbit NS 2028 (1 microM) did not affect relaxant responses to atrial natriuretic factor, an activator of particulate guanylyl cyclase, or forskolin, an activator of adenylyl cyclase. 7 NO-dependent relaxant responses in non-vascular smooth muscle were also inhibited by NS 2028. The nitroglycerin-induced relaxation of guinea-pig trachea preconstricted by histamine was fully inhibited by NS 2028 (1 microM), whereas the relaxations to terbutaline, theophylline and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) were not affected. The relaxant responses to electrical field stimulation of non-adrenergic, non-cholinergic nerves in the same tissue were attenuated by 50% in the presence of NS 2028 (1 microM). 8 NS 2028 and its analogues, one of which is the previously characterized 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3,-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ), appear to be potent and specific inhibitors of soluble guanylyl cyclase present in various cell types. Oxidation and/or a change in the coordination of the haeme-iron of guanylyl cyclase is a likely inhibitory mechanism.",

        "abstract": "The effects of various doses of physostigmine (Phy) on the activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) in plasma, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain were studied in beagle dogs. Two routes of administration were compared: intravenous (i.v.) and intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.). With intracerebroventricular administration, over 90% inhibition of the activity of AChE in CSF was reached within 5 min of injection at all doses (10-120 micrograms). Even at the smallest dose (10 micrograms), 50% inhibition of activity of the enzyme in CSF was still present at 90 min. The activity of AChE in plasma was only minimally inhibited by intraventricular administration of physostigmine. A different response was obtained following intravenous administration of physostigmine (250-1000 micrograms). The activity of AChE in plasma was inhibited but the activity of AChE in CSF was increased (36-80% at 180 min). This increase was dose-dependent and was blocked by pretreatment with atropine (1.5 mg i.v.) which suggests the involvement of a muscarinic receptor mechanism. The time course of the accumulation and regional distribution of [3H]physostigmine in brain also varied with the route of administration. At 5 min, with intravenous administration, physostigmine (1000 micrograms) reached greater concentrations and caused greater inhibition of AChE in the cortex. With intraventricular administration, physostigmine (80 micrograms) reached greater concentrations in two regions adjacent to the ventricular surface: the striatum and hippocampus. These regions also showed greater inhibition of the activity of AChE. Moderate to severe symptoms of cholinergic hyperactivity were seen only with the largest intraventricular dose (120 micrograms). This study suggests that intraventricular administration of physostigmine, a reversible inhibitor of cholinesterase (ChE), may offer distinct advantages over intravenous administration. Inhibition of acetylcholinesterase in CSF was more pronounced and persisted longer when physostigmine was administered directly into the CSF than when given intravenously. The implications of this study for a cholinergic therapy of Alzheimer's disease are discussed.",

In an effort to identify molecular target(s) of CEP-1347 in the JNK cascade, JNK1 and known upstream regulators of JNK1 were co-expressed in Cos-7 cells to determine whether CEP-1347 could modulate JNK1 activation. CEP-1347 blocked JNK1 activation induced by members of the mixed lineage kinase (MLK) family (MLK3, MLK2, MLK1, dual leucine zipper kinase, and leucine zipper kinase). The response was selective because CEP-1347 did not inhibit JNK1 activation in cells induced by kinases independent of the MLK cascade. CEP-1347 inhibition of recombinant MLK members in vitro was competitive with ATP, resulting in IC(50) values ranging from 23 to 51 nm, comparable to inhibitory potencies observed in intact cells. In addition, overexpression of MLK3 led to death in Chinese hamster ovary cells, and CEP-1347 blocked this death at doses comparable to those that inhibited MLK3 kinase activity. These results identify MLKs as targets of CEP-1347 in the JNK signaling cascade and demonstrate that CEP-1347 can block MLK-induced cell death.",

        "abstract": "This study focused on the mechanistic interpretation of ex vivo oxidation of a candidate drug in blood plasma samples. An unexpected lipid peroxide-mediated epoxidation followed by a dramatic rearrangement led to production of a five-membered oxazole derivative from the original six-membered pyrazinone-carboxamide core of a human neutrophil elastase inhibitor, 6-(1-(4-cyanophenyl)-1H-pyrazol-5-yl)-N-ethyl-5-methyl-3-oxo-4-(3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)-3,4-dihydropyrazine-2-carboxamide (AZD9819). The rearranged oxidation product 2-(1-(4-cyanophenyl)-1H-pyrazol-5-yl)-5-(N-ethylacetamido)-N-(3-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)oxazole-4-carboxamide was characterized by accurate-mass tandem mass spectrometry fragmentations, by two-dimensional NMR and X-ray crystallography of an authentic standard, and by incorporation of an (18)O atom from molecular (18)O2 to the location predicted by our proposed mechanism. The lipid peroxide-mediated oxidation was demonstrated by using human low-density lipoprotein (LDL) in pH 7.4 phosphate buffer and by inhibiting the oxidation with ascorbic acid or l-glutathione, two antioxidants effective in both plasma and the LDL incubation. A nucleophilic mechanism for the epoxidation of AZD9819 by lipid hydroperoxides explains the prevention of its ex vivo oxidation by acidification of the plasma samples. The discovery of the lipid peroxide-dependent oxidation of an analyte and the means of prevention could provide valuable information for biotransformation and bioanalysis.",

Several established or novel anti-multiple myeloma (anti-MM) agents, such as dexamethasone, thalidomide, and proteasome inhibitors (PS-341), inhibit NF-kappaB activity as part of their diverse actions. However, studies to date have not delineated the effects of specific inhibition of NF-kappaB activity in MM. We therefore investigated the effect of SN50, a cell-permeable specific inhibitor of NF-kappaB nuclear translocation and activity, on MM cells. SN50 induced apoptosis in MM cell lines and patient cells; down-regulated expression of Bcl-2, A1, X-chromosome-linked inhibitor-of-apoptosis protein (XIAP), cellular inhibitor-of-apoptosis protein 1 (cIAP-1), cIAP-2, and survivin; up-regulated Bax; increased mitochondrial cytochrome c release into the cytoplasm; and activated caspase-9 and caspase-3, but not caspase-8. We have previously demonstrated that tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) is present locally in the bone marrow microenvironment and induces NF-kappaB-dependent up-regulation of adhesion molecules on both MM cells and bone marrow stromal cells, with resultant increased adhesion. In this study, TNF-alpha alone induced NF-kappaB nuclear translocation, cIAP-1 and cIAP-2 up-regulation, and MM cell proliferation; in contrast, SN50 pretreatment sensitized MM cells to TNF-alpha-induced apoptosis and cleavage of caspase-8 and caspase-3, similar to our previous finding of SN50-induced sensitization to apoptosis induced by the TNF-alpha family member TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL)/Apo2L. Moreover, SN50 inhibited TNF-alpha-induced expression of another NF-kappaB target gene, intercellular adhesion molecule-1. Although the p38 inhibitor PD169316 did not directly kill MM cells, it potentiated the apoptotic effect of SN50, suggesting an interaction between the p38 and NF-kappaB pathways. Our results therefore demonstrate that NF-kappaB activity in MM cells promotes tumor-cell survival and protects against apoptotic stimuli. These studies provide the framework for targeting NF-kappaB activity in novel biologically based therapies for MM.",

The present study investigated the effects of a potent and subtype-selective PPARalpha agonist, KRP-101, in a nonrodent insulin-resistant animal model under pair-fed conditions.

KRP-101 administration improved hyperglycemia and hyperinsulinemia as well as dyslipidemia in dogs fed a high-fat diet. Oral glucose tolerance test showed that KRP-101 administration improved glucose intolerance. The KRP-101 group showed a markedly lower hepatic triglyceride concentration.

Sprague-Dawley rats received 2 h middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAo) and were treated with LAU-0901 (60 mg/kg) or vehicle 2 h from MCAo onset. Behavioral function, T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), and apparent diffusion coefficients were performed on days 1, 3, and 7 after MCAo. Infarct volume and number of GFAP, ED-1, and NeuN-positive cells were conducted on day 7. Behavioral deficit was significantly improved by LAU-0901 treatment compared to vehicle on days 1, 3, and 7. Total lesion volumes computed from T2WI were significantly reduced by LAU-0901 on days 1, 3, and 7 (by 83%, 90%, and 96%, respectively), which was consistent with decreased edema formation. Histopathology revealed that LAU-0901 treatment resulted in significant reduction of cortical and subcortical infarct volumes, attenuated microglial infiltration, and promoted astrocytic and neuronal survival. These findings suggest LAU-0901 is a promising neuroprotectant and provide the basis for future therapeutics in patients suffering ischemic stroke.",

The aptamer BAX499 (formerly ARC19499) is designed to improve hemostasis by specifically inhibiting TFPI. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to examine the concentration-dependent augmentation of clotting by BAX499. METHODS: Whole blood clot formation was quantified by rotational thromboelastometry and thromboelastography, and thrombin generation in platelet-poor plasma was assessed with the calibrated automated thrombogram, in samples from patients with congenital hemophilia A (N=55) and B (N=11), patients with acquired hemophilia A (N=1), and healthy controls (N=37). RESULTS: BAX499 significantly improved clotting of samples from hemophilic patients in a concentration-dependent manner, resulting in clotting profiles in samples from patients with severe hemophilia that were similar to those of healthy controls. CONCLUSION: BAX499 improved ex vivo clotting parameters in blood and plasma from patients with hemophilia A and B with different severity of disease, and also in a patient with acquired hemophilia. These results further support the contention that anti TFPI strategies may be an effective treatment for hemophilic patients.",

        "abstract": "Although the androgen receptor (AR) is a known clinical target in prostate cancer, little is known about its possible role in breast cancer. We have investigated the role of AR expression in human breast cancer in response to treatment with the antiestrogen tamoxifen. Resistance to tamoxifen is a major problem in treating women with breast cancer. By gene expression profiling, we found elevated AR and reduced estrogen receptor (ER) alpha mRNA in tamoxifen-resistant tumors. Exogenous overexpression of AR rendered ERalpha-positive MCF-7 breast cancer cells resistant to the growth-inhibitory effects of tamoxifen in anchorage-independent growth assays and in xenograft studies in athymic nude mice. AR-overexpressing cells remained sensitive to growth stimulation with dihydrotestosterone. Treatment with the AR antagonist Casodex (bicalutamide) reversed this resistance, demonstrating the involvement of AR signaling in tamoxifen resistance. In AR-overexpressing cells, tamoxifen induced transcriptional activation by ERalpha that could be blocked by Casodex, suggesting that AR overexpression enhances tamoxifen's agonistic properties. Our data suggest a role for AR overexpression as a novel mechanism of hormone resistance, so that AR may offer a new clinical therapeutic target in human breast cancers.",

METHODS: Inhibition rate of cerulenin on K562 leukemia cells was assayed by MTT method, cell apoptosis by flow cytometry (FCM) and agarose gel electrophoresis. RESULTS: When treated with 10(-9) - 10(-5) mol/L of cerulenin for 24 h, the proliferation of K562 cells was obviously inhibited with dose related effect. At the same concentrations, the inhibition rates of human skin fibroblasts were all lower than 30%. When K562 cells were treated for 12 h with 50 microg/ml and 60 microg/ml of cerulenin, the apoptosis rate revealed by FCM was 42.30% and 38.8%, respectively, and DNA agarose gel electrophoresis showed the typical DNA ladder of apoptosis.

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: The Aurora family of serine/threonine kinases (Aurora-A, Aurora-B, and Aurora-C) plays a key role in cells orderly progression through mitosis. Elevated expression levels of Aurora kinases have been detected in a high percentage of melanoma, colon, breast, ovarian, gastric, and pancreatic tumors. We characterized the biological and pharmacological properties of SNS-314, an ATP-competitive, selective, and potent inhibitor of Aurora kinases. METHODS: We studied the biochemical potency and selectivity of SNS-314 to inhibit Aurora kinases A, B, and C. The inhibition of cellular proliferation induced by SNS-314 was evaluated in a broad range of tumor cell lines and correlated to inhibition of histone H3 phosphorylation, inhibition of cell-cycle progression, increase in nuclear content and cell size, loss of viability, and induction of apoptosis. The dose and administration schedule of SNS-314 was optimized for in vivo efficacy in mouse xenograft models of human cancer. RESULTS: In the HCT116 human colon cancer xenograft model, administration of 50 and 100 mg/kg SNS-314 led to dose-dependent inhibition of histone H3 phosphorylation for at least 10 h, indicating effective Aurora-B inhibition in vivo. HCT116 tumors from animals treated with SNS-314 showed potent and sustained responses including reduction of phosphorylated histone H3 levels, increased caspase-3 and appearance of increased nuclear size. The compound showed significant tumor growth inhibition in a dose-dependent manner under a variety of dosing schedules including weekly, bi-weekly, and 5 days on/9 days off.

Specific PKC isoforms, mainly the beta- and delta-isoforms, have been shown to be persistently activated in diabetic mellitus. Multiple studies have reported that the activation of PKC leads to increased production of extracellular matrix and cytokines, enhances contractility, permeability and vascular cell proliferation, induces the activation of cytosolic phospholipase A2 and inhibits the activity of Na+-K+-ATPase. These events are not only frequently observed in diabetes mellitus but are also involved in the actions of vasoactive agents or oxidative stress. Inhibition of PKC by two different kinds of PKC inhibitors - LY333531, a selective PKC-beta-isoform inhibitor, and vitamin E, d-alpha-tocopheron - were able to prevent or reverse the various vascular dysfunctions in vitro and in vivo.

A small molecule, GSK2256098 (GlaxoSmithKline), has been developed to inhibit FAK activity through targeting the phosphorylation site of FAK, tyrosine (Y) 397. We sought to determine whether GSK2256098 inhibition of FAK Y397 phosphorylation attenuates PDAC-associated cell proliferation, motility and survival. Cultured PDAC cells were used as cellular models of GSK2256098-impaired abnormal growth. Western blot analysis, cell viability analysis, clonogenic survival, soft-agar and wound healing assays were performed. The responses of 6 PDAC cell lines in regards to FAK Y397 phosphorylation or activity to GSK2256098 treatments (0.1-10 muM) ranged from low (less than 20% inhibition) to high (more than 90% inhibition). The least and most sensitive cell lines (PANC-1 and L3.6P1) were selected for further analysis. GSK2256098 inhibition of FAK Y397 phosphorylation correlated with decreased levels of phosphorylated Akt and ERK in L3.6P1 cells. GSK2256098 decreased cell viability, anchorage-independent growth, and motility in a dose dependent manner. Current studies demonstrate that small molecule kinase inhibitors targeting FAK Y397 phosphorylation can inhibit PDAC cell growth.

The present study aimed to investigate the cholinergic system alterations associated with simulated HBH induced cognitive impairment. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were exposed to HBH equivalent to 6100 m for 7 days in a simulation chamber. The cognitive performance was assessed using Morris Water Maze (MWM) task. Cholinergic markers like acetylcholine (ACh) and acetylcholinesterase (AChE) were evaluated in hippocampus and cortex of rats. Neuronal damage was also studied through morphological changes. Exposure to HBH led to impairment in relearning ability and memory retrieval and it was accompanied by decrease in ACh level and increase in AChE and led to morphological damage. Administration of AChE inhibitor (AChEI), physostigmine (PHY) and galantamine (GAL) to rats during HBH exposure resulted in amelioration of the deleterious effects induced by HBH. The AChEIs were able to improve the cholinergic activity by restoring the level of ACh by blocking the AChE activity.

        "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Because high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels are inversely related to cardiovascular disease (CVD), raising HDL-C levels would seem intuitively valuable. However, the recent failure of the cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitor torcetrapib to decrease CVD has raised doubts regarding HDL-C raising in general and CETP inhibition in particular for CVD prevention. We briefly discuss the complexity of HDL metabolism, caveats of CETP inhibition, possible mechanisms for torcetrapib's failure, and the potential utility of other CETP inhibitors. RECENT FINDINGS: Torcetrapib likely failed because of off-target effects, since other CETP inhibitors, such as dalcetrapib (JTT-705/R1658) or anacetrapib (MK-0859), do not increase blood pressure, a specific pressor effect of tocetrapib that appears to be CETP-independent. In small human trials of short duration, anacetrapib and dalcetrapib appear to improve the lipoprotein profile without obvious adverse effects, so far. SUMMARY: The relationship between HDL metabolism, pharmacologic CETP inhibition, and atherosclerosis requires further elucidation. There seems to be sufficient evidence that evaluation of CETP inhibitors such as dalcetrapib and anacetrapib should proceed, if cautiously, since it remains uncertain whether the increased CVD risk with torcetrapib was related to agent-specific off-target effects or more generally to CETP inhibition as a mechanism to raise HDL.",

One of the issues confounding the experimental data has been the lack of potent and selective human beta(3)-AR ligands analogous to the rodent-specific agonist BRL37344. Recently, we described a new class of aryloxypropanolamine beta(3)-AR agonists that potently and selectively activate lipolysis in rhesus isolated adipocytes and stimulate the metabolic rate in rhesus monkeys in vivo. In this article, we describe novel and selective beta(3)-AR antagonists with high affinity for the human receptor. L-748,328 and L-748,337 bind the human cloned beta(3)-AR expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells with an affinity of 3.7 +/- 1.4 and 4.0 +/- 0.4 nM, respectively. They display an affinity of 467 +/- 89 and 390 +/- 154 nM for the human beta(1)-AR. Their selectivity for human beta(3)-AR versus beta(2)-AR is greater than 20-fold (99 +/- 43 nM) and 45-fold (204 +/- 75 nM), respectively. These compounds are competitive antagonists capable of inhibiting the functional activation of agonists in a dose-dependent manner in cells expressing human cloned beta(3)-AR. Moreover, both L-748,328 and L-748,337 inhibit the lipolytic response elicited by the beta(3)-AR agonist L-742,791 in isolated nonhuman primate adipocytes. The aryloxypropanolamine benzenesulfonamide ligands illustrated here and elsewhere demonstrate high-affinity human beta(3)-AR binding. In addition, we describe specific 3'-phenoxy substitutions that transform these compounds from potent agonists into selective antagonists.",

        "abstract": "Fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) is an integral membrane enzyme that degrades the fatty acid amide family of signaling lipids, including the endocannabinoid anandamide. Genetic or pharmacological inactivation of FAAH leads to analgesic, anti-inflammatory, anxiolytic, and antidepressant phenotypes in rodents without showing the undesirable side effects observed with direct cannabinoid receptor agonists, indicating that FAAH may represent an attractive therapeutic target for treatment of pain, inflammation, and other central nervous system disorders. However, the FAAH inhibitors reported to date lack drug-like pharmacokinetic properties and/or selectivity. Herein we describe piperidine/piperazine ureas represented by N-phenyl-4-(quinolin-3-ylmethyl)piperidine-1-carboxamide (PF-750) and N-phenyl-4-(quinolin-2-ylmethyl)piperazine-1-carboxamide (PF-622) as a novel mechanistic class of FAAH inhibitors. PF-750 and PF-622 show higher in vitro potencies than previously established classes of FAAH inhibitors. Rather unexpectedly based on the high chemical stability of the urea functional group, PF-750 and PF-622 were found to inhibit FAAH in a time-dependent manner by covalently modifying the enzyme's active site serine nucleophile. Activity-based proteomic profiling revealed that PF-750 and PF-622 were completely selective for FAAH relative to other mammalian serine hydrolases. We hypothesize that this remarkable specificity derives, at least in part, from FAAH's special ability to function as a C(O)-N bond hydrolase, which distinguishes it from the vast majority of metabolic serine hydrolases in mammals that are restricted to hydrolyzing esters and/or thioesters. The piperidine/piperazine urea may thus represent a privileged chemical scaffold for the synthesis of FAAH inhibitors that display an unprecedented combination of potency and selectivity for use as potential analgesic and anxiolytic/antidepressant agents.",

CP-83101 also inhibited rat hepatic sterol biosynthesis by 39 +/- 7% at a dose of 100 mg/kg. [3H]CP-83101, administered orally to rats, exhibited peak plasma levels at approximately 1 hr that declined thereafter with an apparent half-time of 2-3 hr. Peak tissue levels also occurred 1 hr following oral administration of [3H]CP-83101. The decline in radioactivity in the liver, however, was considerably slower than that noted in blood, whereas the half-life in non-hepatic tissues was approximately 1 hr. Liver/blood ratios of 14, and liver/lens ratios of greater than 3000, following oral administration of [3H]CP-83101, were similar to those previously reported for other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors, suggesting a high degree of tissue selectivity. In addition, liver/adrenal and liver/ovary ratios were approximately 1000 at all time points examined between 30 min and 24 hr following oral [3H]CP-83101 administration, indicating a high specificity for hepatic versus other steroidogenic tissues. Evaluation of intravenous versus oral administration of the water-soluble, free acid, sodium salt of [3H]CP-83101 in bile duct canulated rats indicated that approximately 20% of orally administered CP-83101 is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, and that absorbed CP-83101 is cleared rapidly from the plasma via the liver and from the liver via the bile. In addition, several lines of evidence suggest that CP-83101 may undergo enterohepatic recirculation. Agents of this synthetic series may thus possess advantages over other HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors with respect to tissue kinetics and specificity.",

In vitro and ex vivo results suggest that eptastigmine has a long-lasting reversible brain cholinesterase (i.e., acetylcholinesterase and butyryl-cholinesterase) inhibitory effect. When administered in vivo to rodents by various routes, eptastigmine inhibits cerebral acetylcholinesterases (AChE) and increases acetylcholine (Ach) brain levels by 2500-3000%, depending on the dose. This effect leads to an improvement in the cerebral blood flow in the ischemic brain, excitatory and inhibitory effects on the gastrointestinal tract and to a protection from acute soman and diisopropylfluorophosphate intoxication. Eptastigmine, by either acute or chronic administration, has been found to have memory enhancing effects in different species of normal, aged and lesioned animals. It also restored to normal the age-related increase of EEG power without affecting spontaneous motor activity. Clinical investigations on more than 1500 patients with Alzheimer's disease demonstrated that eptastigmine significantly improved cognitive performance (as assessed by the cognitive subscale of the Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale) as compared with placebo. This improvement was most evident in patients with more severe cognitive impairment at the baseline. The relationship between patient performance and average steady-state AChE inhibition was described by an inverted U-shaped dose-response curve. Pharmacokinetic studies have revealed that after oral administration eptastigmine is rapidly distributed to the tissues and readily enters the CNS, where it can be expected to inhibit AChE for a prolonged period. Eptastigmine is generally well tolerated and the majority of adverse events (cholinergic) were mild to moderate in intensity. However, the adverse hematologic (granulocytopenia) effects reported in two studies have resulted in the suspension of further clinical trials.",

BMY-21950 and its lactone form BMY-22089, new synthetic inhibitors of HMG-CoA reductase, were compared with the major reference agent lovastatin and with the synthetic inhibitor fluindostatin in several in vitro and in vivo models of potency and tissue selectivity. The kinetic mechanism and the potency of BMY-21950 as a competitive inhibitor of isolated HMG-CoA reductase were comparable to the reference agents. The inhibitory potency (cholesterol synthesis assayed by 3H2O or [14C]acetate incorporation) of BMY-21950 in rat hepatocytes (IC50 = 21 nM) and dog liver slices (IC50 = 23 nM) equalled or exceeded the potencies of the reference agents. Hepatic cholesterol synthesis in vivo in rats was effectively inhibited by BMY-21950 and its lactone form BMY-22089 (ED50 = 0.1 mg/kg p.o.), but oral doses (20 mg/kg) that suppressed liver synthesis by 83-95% inhibited sterol synthesis by only 17-24% in the ileum. In contrast, equivalent doses of lovastatin markedly inhibited cholesterol synthesis in both organs. In tissue slices from rat ileum, cell dispersions from testes, adrenal, and spleen, and in bovine ocular lens epithelial cells, BMY-21950 inhibited sterol synthesis weakly in vitro with IC50 values 76- and 188-times higher than in hepatocytes; similar effects were seen for BMY-22089. However, the IC50 ratios (tissue/hepatocyte) for lovastatin and fluindostatin were near unity in these models. Thus, BMY-21950 and BMY-22089 are the first potent synthetic HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors that possess a very high degree of liver selectivity based upon differential inhibition sensitivities in tissues. This cellular uptake-based property of hepatic specificity of BMY-21950 and BMY-22089, also manifest in pravastatin, is biochemically distinct from the pharmacodynamic-based disposition of lovastatin, which along with fluindostatin exhibited potent inhibition in all tissues that were exposed to it.",

Two calcium-insensitive isoforms of novel PKC, PKC delta and epsilon, have received particular attention as promising targets for new drugs.

Professor Mochly-Rosen's group and KAI Pharmaceuticals Inc. have developed drugs targeted against PKC delta (KAI-9803) and epsilon (KAI-1678). These drugs ameliorate pathological conditions in acute myocardial infarction and reduce pain via specific modulation of membrane-translocation of PKC delta or epsilon. Another research group has recently used the KinAce() approach to produce PKC epsilon-abrogating peptides (KCe-12 and KCe-16) that are based on the catalytic domain of PKC.

The enzyme is therefore a target for autoimmunity disorders, tissue transplant rejection and T-cell malignancies.

The transition state of human PNP differs from that of the bovine enzyme and transition state analogues specific for the human enzyme were synthesized. Three first generation transition state analogues, ImmG (Kd = 42 pM), ImmH (Kd = 56 pM), and 8-aza-ImmH (Kd = 180 pM), are compared with three second generation DADMe compounds (4'-deaza-1'-aza-2'-deoxy-1'-(9-methylene)-immucillins) tailored to the transition state of human PNP.

The DADMe-immucillins are the most powerful PNP inhibitors yet described, with Km/Kd ratios up to 5,400,000. ImmH and DADMe-ImmH are orally available in mice; DADMe-ImmH is more efficient than ImmH.

Furthermore, the LPS-mediated induction of tissue factor (TF), a cell surface protein responsible for initiating the coagulation cascade, is also inhibited by piceatannol. The effectiveness of piceatannol in blocking both the inflammatory response and the coagulation pathway is evidenced by its ability to confer protection against LPS-induced septic shock in a murine model.

Guanine, 8-hydroxyguanine, 8-methylguanine, and 8-bromoguanine inhibited the enzyme activity in a GFRP-dependent and pH-dependent manner and induced complex formation between GTP cyclohydrolase I and GFRP.

The two compounds did not induce complex formation between the enzyme and GFRP.

        "title": "Equally potent inhibitors of cholesterol synthesis in human hepatocytes have distinguishable effects on different cytochrome P450 enzymes.",
        "abstract": "Six 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (the present cholesterol-lowering drugs known as statins), lovastatin (L), simvastatin (S), pravastatin (P), fluvastatin (F), atorvastatin (A) and cerivastatin (C) are shown to be potent inhibitors of cholesterol synthesis in human hepatocytes, the target tissue for these drugs in man. All six inhibited in the nM range (IC(50) values: 0.2-8.0 nM). As daily used cholesterol-lowering drugs they are likely coadministered with other drugs. While several cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes are involved in drug metabolism in the liver and thus play an important role in drug-drug interaction it was investigated which of these enzymes are influenced by the active forms of the six statins. These enzyme activities were studied in human liver microsomal preparations, and in simian and human hepatocytes in primary culture. The following CYP reactions were used: nifedipine aromatization (CYP3A4), testosterone 6beta-hydroxylation (CYP3A4), tolbutamide methylhydroxylation (CYP2C9), S-mephenytoin 4-hydroxylation (CYP2C19), bufuralol 1'-hydroxylation (CYP2D6), aniline 4-hydroxylation (CYP2E1), coumarin 7-hydroxylation (CYP2A6) and 7-ethoxyresorufin O-dealkylation (CYP1A1/2). In the human liver microsomes the statins (concentrations up to 400 microM) did not influence the CYP1A1/2 activity and hardly the CYP2A6 and CYP2E1 activities. Except P, the other five statins were stronger inhibitors of the CYP2C19 activity with IC(50) values around 200 microM and the same holds for the effect of A, C and F on the CYP2D6 activity. L and S were weaker inhibitors of the latter enzyme activity, whereas P did not influence both activities. About the same was observed for the statin effect on CYP2C9 activity, except that F was a strong inhibitor of this activity (IC(50) value: 4 microM). Using the assay of testosterone 6beta-hydroxylation the CYP3A4 activity was decreased by L, S and F with IC(50) values of about 200 microM and a little more by C and A (IC(50) around 100 microM). P had hardly an effect on this activity. To a somewhat less extent the same trend was seen when CYP3A4 activity was measured using nifedipine as substrate. The inhibitory effects observed in microsomes were verified in suspension culture of freshly isolated hepatocytes from Cynomolgus monkey (as a readily available model) and of human hepatocytes. In general the same trends were seen as in the human microsomes, except that in some cases the inhibition of the CYP activity was less, possibly by the induction of the particular CYP enzyme by incubation of the cells with a particular statin. F remained a strong inhibitor of CYP2C9 activity in human and monkey hepatocytes. A induced the CYP2C9 in monkey hepatocytes but was an inhibitor of the CYP2C9 in human hepatocytes. A, S, L and C were moderate inhibitors in both cellular systems of CYP3A4. P was not affecting any of the CYP activities in the three systems studied. It is concluded that different CYP enzymes interact with different statins and therefore differences in between these drugs are to be expected when drug-drug interaction is considered.",

        "abstract": "Adenosine A1 receptors in the brain are believed to play an important role in brain functioning. We have discovered a novel adenosine A1 receptor antagonist, FR194921 (2-(1-methyl-4-piperidinyl)-6-(2-phenylpyrazolo[1,5-a]pyridin-3-yl)-3(2H)-pyridazinone), and characterized the pharmacological activity in the present study. FR194921 showed potent and selective affinity for the adenosine A1 receptor without affinity for A2A and A3 receptors and did not show any species differences in binding affinity profile among human, rat, and mouse. Pharmacokinetic study in rats revealed that FR194921 was orally active and highly brain penetrable. Oral administration of FR194921 dose-dependently ameliorated the hypolocomotion induced by the A1 receptor agonist N6-cyclopentyladenosine in rats, indicating this compound exerts A1-antagonistic action in vivo. In the passive avoidance test, scopolamine (1 mg/kg)-induced memory deficits were significantly ameliorated by FR194921 (0.32, 1 mg/kg). In two animal models of anxiety, the social interaction test and elevated plus maze, FR194921 showed specific anxiolytic activity without significantly influencing general behavior. In contrast, FR194921 did not show antidepressant activity even at a dose of 32 mg/kg in the rat forced swimming test. These results indicate that the novel, potent, and selective adenosine A1 receptor antagonist FR194921 exerts both cognitive-enhancing and anxiolytic activity, suggesting the therapeutic potential of this compound for dementia and anxiety disorders.",

        "abstract": "Glutathione reductase has a central role in glutathione metabolism and as such is a potential target for chemotherapy. The aim of the work was to purify and characterise glutathione reductase from the cestode Moniezia expansa and to compare the properties of the helminth enzyme with its mammalian counterpart. The enzyme was purified by a combination of anion exchange and affinity chromatography and further characterized by chromatofocusing and gel electrophoresis. Analysis revealed a single isoenzyme of glutathione reductase in Moniezia expansa, with a pI of 5.8. The enzyme was a homodimer of native molecular weight 114 kDa, subunit weight 63 kDa. Enzyme activity was affected by buffer concentration and the presence of monovalent sodium salts. The pH optimum was 7.4 with NADPH as cofactor and 5 with NADH. The Kma for oxidized glutathione was 76 microM and for NADPH and NADH, 21 and 350 microM respectively. In addition to oxidized glutathione only the mixed disulphide between CoA and glutathione (CoASSG) showed any significant activity as substrate. The cestode enzyme was inhibited by a variety of compounds including arsonic derivatives, 2,4,6 trinitrobenzene sulfonate 1,3-bis (2-chlorethyl)-1-nitrosourea and oxidized glutathione. In conclusion the glutathione reductase of M. expansa resembles the mammalian enzyme in its general physical properties and its substrate and inhibitor profile. However, the parasite enzyme shows an unusually high activity with the mixed disulphide of coenzyme A and glutathione (CoASSG) and appears to be more sensitive to inhibition by sodium ions.",

The disease is one of the most common sexually transmitted disease and can augment the predisposition of individuals to human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. Although the disease can be treated with metronidazole and related 5-nitroimidazole, cases of trichomonal vaginitis which are refractory to standard treatment seems to be increasing. Clearly, new antitrichomonad agents are needed and DNA topoisomerase II may acts as a new target for antitrichomonad agents. In this study, in vitro sensitivity of T. vaginalis to DNA topoisomerase II was investigated. Axenic culture of local strain of T. vaginalis was performed. Both eukaryotic and prokaryotic DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors such as ellipticine, amsacrine and fluoroquinolones were tested for effectiveness against T. vaginalis in vitro compared to metronidazole. T. vaginalis was sensitive to metronidazole under aerobic conditions. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of eukaryotic DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors, ellipticine and amsacrine, were 6.4 mM and 64 mM, respectively. The MICs of prokaryotic DNA topoisomerase II or DNA gyrase inhibitors; ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin and norfloxacin were 64, 960 and 1,280 mM, respectively.

Various studies suggest that sivelestat treatment reduces inflammation. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that sivelestat acts as an inhibitor of inflammatory mediators and prevents nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB) activation. METHODS: In the presence and absence of sivelestat, the mouse macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 was stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and the levels of inflammatory mediators (TNF-alpha, IL-6 and high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1)) and nitrite in the cell supernatant were measured, along with inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression. RESULTS: While LPS administration increased the secretion of inflammatory mediators and nitric oxide (NO), sivelestat decreased the secretion of these mediators. Cell signaling studies demonstrated that sivelestat decreased NF-kB activation by inhibiting IkB phosphorylation.

Inhibitors of this enzyme are therefore being developed as potential immunosuppressive agents. We have compared the effects of 8-aminoguanosine, a competitive inhibitor of purine nucleoside phosphorylase, on the metabolism of 2'-deoxyguanosine by human T lymphoblasts, B lymphoblasts, and mature T-cell lines. 8-Aminoguanosine markedly potentiates the accumulation of dGTP in T lymphoblasts, but results in increased GTP levels in B lymphoblasts and mature T cells. GTP accumulation is associated with ATP depletion of a magnitude similar to that seen with an inhibitor of de novo purine biosynthesis, but does not result in inhibition of either DNA or RNA synthesis. In contrast, direct inhibition of de novo purine biosynthesis sharply decreased the incorporation of [3H]uridine into both DNA and RNA. We conclude that the mechanism of cell damage resulting from prolonged accumulation of GTP appears to involve more than inhibition of de novo purine biosynthesis and consequent ATP depletion.

The activity of camptothecin and its derivatives was studied on extracellular L. infantum infrared-emitting promastigotes and on an ex vivo murine model of infected splenocytes with L. infantum fluorescent amastigotes. In situ formation of SDS/KCl precipitable DNA-protein complexes in Leishmania promastigotes indicated that these drugs are DNA topoisomerase IB poisons. The inhibitory potency of camptothecin derivatives on recombinant L. infantum topoisomerase IB was assessed in vitro showing that gimatecan is the most active compound preventing the relaxation of supercoiled DNA at submicromolar concentrations. Cleavage equilibrium assays in Leishmania topoisomerase IB show that gimatecan changes the equilibrium towards cleavage at much lower concentrations than the other camptothecin derivatives and that this effect persists over time. Gimatecan and camptothecin were the most powerful compounds preventing cell growth of free-living L. infantum promastigotes within the same concentration range. All these compounds killed L. infantum splenocyte-infecting amastigotes within the nanomolar range.

Twelve patients were studied during and after administration of 20 mg bolus plus 60 mg continuous 1 h i.v. infusion of saruplase. For u-PA antigen and total u-PA activity (expressed as protein equivalents), where 234 U corresponds to 1 microgram, respectively, steady state plasma concentrations were 2.75 +/- 8.3 and 2.50 +/- 7.0 micrograms/ml (mean +/- standard deviation) and were reached within 20 min, t1/2 lambda 1 was 9.1 +/- 1.8 and 7.8 +/- 1.3 min, t1/2 lambda 2 1.2 +/- 0.2 and 1.9 +/- 0.5 h, and the total clearance was 393 +/- 110 and 427 +/- 113 ml/min. Inactivation of saruplase in plasma was negligible. After 15 min, tcu-PA was detected in plasma. From the ratio of the areas under the curve of tcu-PA and total u-PA activities it was calculated that 28 +/- 9.3% of the saruplase dose is converted into active tcu-PA. Systemic plasminaemia occurs as shown by a decrease in alpha 2-antiplasmin and fibrinogen and an increase in fibrinogen degradation products. Thrombin-antithrombin complex formation indicated activation of the clotting system. Saruplase is eliminated rapidly from plasma in AMI patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "abstract": "1. Inhibitory modulation of sympathetic nerve function may have a favourable impact on the progression of congestive heart failure. Nepicastat is a novel inhibitor of dopamine-beta-hydroxylase, the enzyme which catalyses the conversion of dopamine to noradrenaline in sympathetic nerves. The in vitro pharmacology and in vivo catecholamine modulatory effects of nepicastat were investigated in the present study. 2. Nepicastat produced concentration-dependent inhibition of bovine (IC50 = 8.5 +/- 0.8 nM) and human (IC50 = 9.0 +/- 0.8 nM) dopamine-beta-hydroxylase. The corresponding R-enantiomer (RS-25560-198) was approximately 2-3 fold less potent than nepicastat. Nepicastat had negligible affinity (&gt; 10 microM) for twelve other enzymes and thirteen neurotransmitter receptors. 3. Administration of nepicastat to spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) (three consecutive doses of either 3, 10, 30 or 100 mg kg-1, p.o.; 12 h apart) or beagle dogs (0.05, 0.5, 1.5 or 5 mg kg-1, p.o.; b.i.d., for 5 days) produced dose-dependent decreases in noradrenaline content, increases in dopamine content and increases in dopamine/noradrenaline ratio in the artery (mesenteric or renal), left ventricle and cerebral cortex. At the highest dose studied, the decreases in tissue noadrenaline were 47%, 35% and 42% (in SHRs) and 88%, 91% and 96% (in dogs) in the artery, left ventricle and cerebral cortex, respectively. When tested at 30 mg kg-1, p.o., in SHRs, nepicastat produced significantly greater changes in noradrenaline and dopamine content, as compared to the R-enantiomer (RS-25560-198), in the mesenteric artery and left ventricle. 4. Administration of nepicastat (2 mg kg-1, b.i.d, p.o.) to beagle dogs for 15 days produced significant decreases in plasma concentrations of noradrenaline and increases in plasma concentrations of dopamine and dopamine/noradrenaline ratio. The peak reduction (52%) in plasma concentration of noradrenaline and the peak increase (646%) in plasma concentration of dopamine were observed on day-6 and day-7 of dosing, respectively. 5. The findings of this study suggest that nepicastat is a potent, selective and orally active inhibitor of dopamine-beta-hydroxylase which produces gradual modulation of the sympathetic nervous system by inhibiting the biosynthesis of noradrenaline. This drug may, therefore, be of value in the treatment of cardiovascular disorders associated with over-activation of the sympathetic nervous system, such as congestive heart failure.",

        "title": "Comparison of recombinant human PDE4 isoforms: interaction with substrate and inhibitors.",
        "abstract": "Four cyclic-nucleotide phosphodiesterase (PDE) genes belonging to the PDE4 family (PDE4A, 4B, 4C and 4D) have been identified. All four isogenes, including several deletions and alterations of the amino, carboxyl and central catalytic domains, were expressed in insect cells. Lysates were characterised for enzyme activity by using the Km for substrate and the EC50 for activation by the cofactor Mg2+. The catalytic domain alone appears to be sufficient for the normal enzymatic function of PDE4 proteins. Substrate affinity varied by less than 2-fold between catalytic-domain forms of the PDE4A, 4B and 4D isogenes and the long forms (PDE4A5, PDE4B1 and PDE4D3). The affinity for Mg2+ varied by less than 4-fold between long and catalytic-domain forms of PDE4A and 4B. The catalytic-domain form of PDE4D, however, had a 12-fold lower affinity for Mg2+ that was restored by including a portion of the amino-terminal domain, upstream conserved region-2 (UCR2). This result suggests that the Mg2+-binding site of PDE4D involves the UCR2 region. Inhibition of the PDE4 proteins by synthetic compounds is apparently affected differently by the domains. For PDE4B, the catalytic domain is sufficient for interactions with the inhibitors studied: IBMX, trequinsin, rolipram, TVX 2706, RP 73401 and RS-25344. For PDE4D the catalytic-domain form is less sensitive than the long form to inhibition by RS-25344, rolipram and TVX 2706, by 1463-, 11-and 12-fold, respectively. Addition of UCR2 to the catalytic-domain form of PDE4D restored all the lost sensitivities. The catalytic-domain form of PDE4A showed a reduced inhibitor affinity with RS-25344 and TVX 2706 by 77- and 90-fold, respectively. Both catalytic-domain and long forms of PDE4 isogenes interacted with equal affinity with the non-specific inhibitors IBMX and trequinsin, as well as the very potent PDE4-specific inhibitor RP 73401. Other potent and specific PDE4 inhibitors, such as rolipram, RS-25344 or TVX 2706, appear to utilize non-catalytic domain interactions with PDE4D and 4A to supplement those within the catalytic domains. These observations suggest a different relation between amino and catalytic domains in PDE4D relative to PDE4B. We therefore propose a model to illustrate these isogene-specific PDE4 domain interactions with substrate, inhibitors and the co-factor Mg2+. The model for PDE4D is also discussed in relation to changes in the activation curve for Mg2+ and sensitivity to RS-25344 that accompany phosphorylation of the long form by protein kinase A.",

[125I]-iodophenpropit, radiolabelled to a high specific activity of 1900 Ci mmol-1, saturably bound to a single class of sites with a KD of 0.57 +/- 0.16 nM (n = 4) and Bmax of 268 +/- 119 fmol mg-1 protein. 3. Specific binding at a concentration below 1 nM represented 50 to 60% of total binding. 4. Binding of [125I]-iodophenpropit to rat cerebral cortex membranes was readily displaced by histamine H3-agonists and antagonists. In contrast, the inhibitory potencies of selective histamine H1- and H2-receptor ligands were very low. 5. [125I]-iodophenpropit was biphasically displaced by the histamine H3-receptor antagonists, burimamide and dimaprit, which may indicate the existence of histamine H3-receptor subtypes. Other histamine H3-receptor antagonists showed a monophasic displacement. 6. Competition binding curves of H3-agonists were biphasic and showed a rightward shift upon the addition of the nonhydrolysable GTP analogue, guanosine 5'-o-(3-thio) triphosphate (GTP gamma S; 100 microM) which implicates the interaction of histamine H3-receptors with G-proteins. The affinities of the H3-receptor antagonists iodophenpropit, thioperamide and burimamide were not altered by GTP gamma S. 7. Histamine competition binding curves were shifted to the right by different nucleotides (100 microM) with a rank order of potency GTP gamma S &gt; Gpp(NH)p, GTP. 8 In vitro autoradiographic studies revealed a heterogeneous distribution of [125I]-iodophenpropitbinding sites in rat brain, with highest densities observed in specific cerebral cortical areas and layers,the caudate-putamen complex, the olfactory tubercles, the hippocampal formation, the amygdala complex, the hypothalamic area and the mammillary bodies.9 It is concluded that the histamine H3-receptor antagonist, [125I]-iodophenpropit, meets the criteria fo ra suitable radioligand for histamine H3-receptor binding studies in rat brain.",

Interestingly, compound 16 (4,5,6,7-tetrafluoro-3-perfluorophenyl-1H-indazole) inhibited NOS-II activity by 80%, but it did not affect to NOS-I activity. Structural comparison between these new indazoles further supports the importance of the aromatic indazole skeleton for NOS inhibition and indicate that bulky groups or N-methylation of 1 and 2 diminish their effect on NOS activity. The fluorination of the aromatic ring increased the inhibitory potency and NOS-II selectivity, suggesting that this is a promising strategy for NOS selective inhibitors.",

Oral administration of KW-5092 (10-30 mg/kg), a gastroprokinetic agent with acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory and ACh release enhancing activities, caused a dose-dependent increase in the ACh content of both the blood and plasma, as well as several behavioral side effects due to peripheral cholinergic stimulation. The size of the increase in the plasma ACh content at each dose of KW-5092 was greater than that in the blood, indicating that KW-5092 caused the increase in the blood ACh content through elevation of the plasma ACh content, by inhibition of AChE and facilitation of ACh release.

        "abstract": "UNLABELLED: The availability of an analgesic compound devoid of the side effects associated with the commonly used opioid and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs would be useful during the perioperative period. Although adenosine has analgesic and anesthetic-sparing properties, it also produces dose-dependent cardiovascular depression. Inhibitors of adenosine kinase may be able to provide analgesia without producing acute cardiovascular or respiratory depression. This preliminary study investigated the effects of a novel adenosine kinase-inhibiting drug, GP683, on the minimum alveolar anesthetic concentration (MAC) of desflurane in dogs. Seven mongrel dogs were administered one of three different GP683 dose regimens (or the solvent) by intravenous infusion on separate occasions according to a cross-over study design. After determining the baseline desflurane MAC value, GP683 was infused at 75, 150, or 300 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1) for 5 min as a loading dose, followed by 15, 30, or 60 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1) for an additional 85 min to maintain a stable plasma drug level. The desflurane MAC was redetermined 30-90 min after starting the study drug or vehicle infusion, and 30-90 min and 120-180 min after termination of the infusion. Cardiovascular variables and plasma concentrations of GP683 were determined at specific intervals before, during, and after the MAC determinations. The three GP683 dose regimens produced 22%, 31%, and 50% decreases in the desflurane MAC, respectively. In addition, there was good correlation between the decrease in desflurane MAC and the plasma GP683 concentration (r = -0.78). Although the mean arterial pressure (MAP) was decreased up to 25% by the highest infusion rate of GP683, adjustments in the desflurane concentration to an equi-MAC value resulted in normalization of the MAP values. Furthermore, GP683 produced no changes in heart rate. In conclusion, the adenosine kinase-inhibiting drug, GP683, produced dose-dependent decreases in the desflurane MAC of dogs without producing untoward hemodynamic changes. IMPLICATIONS: An investigational drug (GP683) that can increase the levels of an important endogenous substance in the body (adenosine) has been found to decrease the anesthetic requirement in dogs without producing adverse effects on the cardiovascular system.",

The histamine dose-response curve was mimicked by the H3 receptor agonist (R) alpha-MeHA, but at 100 times lower potency, Ka = 0.3 mM. Histamine-induced adenylate cyclase activation was abolished by H2, H1 and H3 receptor antagonists, according to the following order of potency IC50: famotidine (0.3 microM) greater than triprolidine (0.1 mM) thioperamide (2 mM), respectively. Famotidine has no action on membrane components activating the adenylate cyclase system, including the Gs subunit of the enzyme stimulated by forskolin and cell surface receptors sensitive to isoproterenol (beta 2-type), PGE2 and VIP. The Schild plot was linear for famotidine (P less than 0.01) with a regression coefficient r = 0.678. The slope of the regression line was 0.64 and differs from unity. Accordingly, famotidine showed a slow onset of inhibition and dissociation from the H2 receptor in human cancerous HGT-1 cells. The results demonstrate that famotidine is a potent and selective H2 receptor antagonist with uncompetitive actions in human gastric mucosa. Consequently, famotidine might be a suitable drug with long-lasting actions in the treatment of Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. The results also confirm and extend the previous observations that (R) alpha-MeHA and thioperamide are two selective ligands at histamine H3 receptor sites. In the human gastric mucosa, these drugs are respectively 330 and 6700 times less potent than histamine and famotidine on the adenylate cyclase system.

For the xenograft study, MDAM was administered at the maximum tolerated dose by the following dose schedules: (a) 5-day continuous i.v. infusion at 1.0 mg/kg/day (schedule I); and (b) i.v. push, daily for 5 days at 50 mg/kg/day (schedule II). The maximum tolerated dose values for methotrexate (MTX) under these conditions were 0.2 and 1.0 mg/kg/day for schedule I and schedule II, respectively. MTX did not exhibit any significant antitumor activity in this model system by both schedules; however, MDAM induced complete responses of 13 and 25% and partial responses of 25 and 50% by schedules I and II, respectively. MDAM also exhibited antitumor activity significantly superior to that of MTX in the P388 tumor model. One of the enantiomers of MDAM, which possesses the natural configuration at the gamma-methyleneglutamate moiety (l-MDAM), has been shown to be a better inhibitor of human recombinant dihydrofolate reductase and H35 hepatoma cell growth than D,L-MDAM. L-MDAM inhibited the uptake of radiolabeled folinic acid to H35 hepatoma cells eight times more efficiently than MTX. The results indicate that the superior activity of MDAM relative to MTX may be partially due to a combination of enhanced transport to tumor cells and slower deactivation by aldehyde oxidase.",

Using measurements with the Ca2+-sensitive fluorescent dye fura-2 and the whole-cell patch-clamp technique, we found that D-erythro-sphingosine, a metabolite arising during the de novo synthesis of cellular sphingolipids, activated TRPM3.

        "abstract": "Inhibitors of cyclin-dependent kinases (Cdks) have been reported to have activities in chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells by inhibiting Cdk7 and Cdk9, which control transcription. Here we studied the novel Cdk inhibitor SNS-032, which exhibits potent and selective inhibitory activity against Cdk2, Cdk7, and Cdk9. We hypothesized that transient inhibition of transcription by SNS-032 would decrease antiapoptotic proteins, resulting in cell death. SNS-032 effectively killed chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells in vitro regardless of prognostic indicators and treatment history. This was associated with inhibition of phosphorylation of RNA polymerase II and inhibition of RNA synthesis. Consistent with the intrinsic turnover rates of their transcripts and proteins, antiapoptotic proteins, such as Mcl-1 and X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), were rapidly reduced on exposure to SNS-032, whereas Bcl-2 protein was not affected. The initial decrease of Mcl-1 protein was the result of transcriptional inhibition rather than cleavage by caspase. Compared with flavopiridol and roscovitine, SNS-032 was more potent, both in inhibition of RNA synthesis and at induction of apoptosis. SNS-032 activity was readily reversible; removal of SNS-032 reactivated RNA polymerase II, which led to resynthesis of Mcl-1 and cell survival. Thus, these data support the clinical development of SNS-032 in diseases that require short-lived oncoproteins for survival.",

Oxazolidinone binding sites were found on both 30S and 50S subunits, rRNA being the only target. On 16S rRNA, an oxazolidinone footprint was found at A864 in the central domain. 23S rRNA residues involved in oxazolidinone binding were U2113, A2114, U2118, A2119, and C2153, all in domain V. This region is close to the binding site of protein L1 and of the 3' end of tRNA in the E site. The mechanism of action of oxazolidinones in vitro was examined in a purified translation system from E. coli using natural mRNA.

Systemic A-134974 (i.p.) dose dependently reduced hyperalgesia (ED(50) = 1 micromol/kg) and at higher doses, reduced locomotor activity (ED(50) = 16 micromol/kg). Administration of A-134974 intrathecally (i.t.) was more potent (ED(50) = 6 nmol) at producing antihyperalgesia than delivering the compound by intracerebralventricular (ED(50) = 100 nmol, i.c.v.) or intraplantar (ED(50) &gt;300 nmol) routes. In contrast, i.c.v. administration of A-134974 was more effective in reducing locomotor activity than i.t. administration (ED(50) values were 1 and &gt;100 nmol, respectively). Increasing the pretreatment time for i.t.-delivered A-134974 caused a greater reduction in locomotor activity (ED(50) = 10 nmol). This was due to diffusion of A-134974 (i.t.) to supraspinal sites. The antihyperalgesic effects of systemic A-134974 were antagonized by the adenosine receptor antagonist theophylline (THEO, 30-500 nmol) administered i.t., but not i.c.v. In the locomotor assay, i.t.-injected THEO did not antagonize hypomobility caused by systemic or i.t. administration of A-134974. However, i.c.v. infusion of THEO did block the hypomotive actions of i.c.v.-, i.t.-, and i.p.-administered A-134974. These data demonstrate that the novel AK inhibitor A-134974 potently reduces thermal hyperalgesia primarily through interactions with spinal sites, whereas its ability to depress locomotor activity is predominantly mediated by supraspinal sites.",

        "abstract": "CTP:Phosphocholine cytidylyltransferase (CT) catalyzes the key step in phosphatidylcholine (PC) synthesis. CT is activated by binding to certain lipid membranes. The membrane binding affinity of CT can vary from micromolar to millimolar K(d), depending on the lipid composition of the target membrane. Class II CT activators like diacylglycerols and unsaturated phosphatidylethanolamines (PE) favor inverted lipid phase formation. The mechanism(s) governing CT's association with class II lipid membranes and subsequent activation are relatively unknown. We measured CT activation by vesicles composed of PC and one of three unsaturated PEs, dioleoylglycerol (DOG), or cholesterol. For each lipid system, we estimated the stored curvature strain energy of the monolayer when confined to a relatively flat bilayer. CT binding and activation correlate very well with the curvature strain energy of several chemically distinct class II lipid systems, with the exception of those containing cholesterol, in which CT activation was less than the increase in curvature strain. CT activation by membranes containing DOG was reversed by inclusion of specific lysolipids, which reduce curvature strain energy. LysoPC, which has a larger positive curvature than lysoPE, produced greater inhibition of CT activation. Stored curvature strain energy is thus an important determinant of CT activation. Membrane interfacial polarity was investigated using a membrane-anchored fluorescent probe. Decreases in quenching of this interfacial probe by doxyl-PCs in class II membranes suggest the probe adopts a more superficial membrane location. This may reflect an increased surface hydrophobicity of class II lipid membranes, implying a role for surface dehydration in CT's interactions with membranes containing class II lipids. Cholesterol, a poor activator of CT, did not affect the positioning of the polarity-sensitive probe, suggesting that one reason for its ineffectiveness is an inability to enhance surface hydrophobicity.",

An understudied therapeutic target is HIV integrase, an essential enzyme that mediates integration of the HIV genome into the host chromosome. The dicaffeoylquinic acids (DCQAs) and the dicaffeoyltartaric acids (DCTAs) have potent activity against HIV integrase in vitro and prevent HIV replication in tissue culture. However, their specificity against HIV integrase in cell culture has been questioned. Thus, the ability of the DCQAs and DCTAs to inhibit binding of HIV type 1 (HIV-1) gp120 to CD4 and their activities against HIV-1 reverse transcriptase and HIV RNase H were studied. The DCQAs and DCTAs inhibited HIV-1 integrase at concentrations between 150 and 840 nM. They inhibited HIV replication at concentrations between 2 and 12 microM. Their activity against reverse transcriptase ranged from 7 microM to greater than 100 microM. Concentrations that inhibited gp120 binding to CD4 exceeded 80 microM. None of the compounds blocked HIV-1 RNase H by 50% at concentrations exceeding 80 microM. Furthermore, when the effects of the DCTAs on reverse transcription in acutely infected cells were measured, they were found to have no activity. Therefore, the DCQAs and DCTAs exhibit &gt; 10- to &gt; 100-fold specificity for HIV integrase, and their activity against integrase in biochemical assays is consistent with their observed anti-HIV activity in tissue culture. Thus, the DCQAs and DCTAs are a potentially important class of HIV inhibitors that act at a site distinct from that of current HIV therapeutic agents.",

Electrophysiological characterisation on the neonatal rat spinal cord preparation revealed that (S)-3,4-DCPG depressed the fast component of the dorsal root-evoked ventral root potential (fDR-VRP) giving a biphasic concentration-response curve showing EC(50) values of 1.3+/-0.2 microM (n=17) and 391+/-81 microM (n=17) for the higher and lower affinity components, respectively. The receptor mediating the high-affinity component was antagonised by 200 microM (S)-alpha-methyl-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyrate (MAP4, K(D) value 5.4+/-1.5 microM (n=3)), a group III metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptor antagonist.

(S)-3,4-DCPG-induced depressions of the fDR-VRP in the low-affinity range of the concentration-response curve were potentiated by 200 microM (S)-alpha-ethylglutamate (EGLU), a group II mGlu receptor antagonist, and were relatively unaffected by MAP4 (200 microM). However, depressions of the fDR-VRP mediated by the AMPA selective antagonist (R)-3,4-DCPG were not potentiated by EGLU, suggesting that the low-affinity component of the concentration-response curve for (S)-3,4-DCPG is not due to antagonism of postsynaptic AMPA receptors. It is suggested that the receptor responsible for mediating the high-affinity component is mGlu8.

When tested on mGlu2, mGlu4 or mGlu5 receptors its IC(50) was &gt;300 microM. When tested in cortical wedges, however, 3-MATIDA was also able to antagonize AMPA or NMDA responses with an IC(50) of 250 microM. When present in the incubation medium of cultured murine cortical cells, 3-MATIDA (1-100 microM) significantly reduced the death of neurons induced by 60 min of oxygen and glucose deprivation (OGD), even when added up to 60 min after OGD. A similar neuroprotective activity was observed when 3-MATIDA was present at 10-100 microM in the medium of rat organotypic hippocampal slice cultures exposed to 30 min OGD. Systemic administration of 3-MATIDA (3-10 mg/kg, immediately and 1 h after the onset of ischemia) reduced the volume of brain infarcts following permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion in rats. Our results show that 3-MATIDA is a potent and possibly selective mGlu 1 receptor antagonist that may be considered as a novel prototype neuroprotective agent.",

The two diketo acid integrase inhibitors (L-708,906 and L-731,988) blocked the accumulation of integrated HIV-1 DNA in T cells following infection but did not alter levels of newly synthesized extrachromosomal HIV DNA. In contrast, we demonstrated that L17 (a member of the bisaroyl hydrazine family of integrase inhibitors) and AR177 (an oligonucleotide inhibitor) blocked the HIV replication cycle at, or prior to, reverse transcription, although both drugs inhibited integrase activity in cell-free assays. Quercetin dihydrate (a flavone) was shown to not have any antiviral activity in our system despite reported anti-integration properties in cell-free assays. This refined Alu-PCR assay for HIV provirus is a useful tool for screening anti-integration compounds identified in biochemical assays for their ability to inhibit the accumulation of integrated HIV DNA in cell culture, and it may be useful for studying the effects of these inhibitors in clinical trials.",

RESULTS: We have now identified a series of 5H-pyrano[2,3-d:-6,5-d']dipyrimidines that block the replication of various strains of HIV-1 and HIV-2. The most potent congener, 5-(4-nitrophenyl)-2,8-dithiol-4,6-dihydroxy-5H-pyrano[2,3-d:-6,5-d']dipyrimidine (V-165), inhibited the replication of HIV-1(III(B)) in MT-4 cells at a 50% effective concentration (EC(50)) of 8.9 microM, which is 14-fold below its cytotoxic concentration. V-165 was equally active against virus strains that were resistant toward inhibitors of viral entry or reverse transcriptase. In combination regimens in cell culture, V-165 acted subsynergistically with zidovudine or nelfinavir and synergistically with nevirapine. V-165 inhibited both reverse transcriptase and integrase activities in enzymatic assays at micromolar concentrations, but only a close correlation was found between the anti-HIV activity observed in cell culture and the inhibitory activity in the integrase strand transfer assays. Time-of-addition experiments indicated that V-165 interfered with the viral replication cycle at a time point coinciding with integration. Quantitative Alu-PCR corroborated that the anti-HIV activity of V-165 is based upon the inhibition of proviral DNA integration. CONCLUSIONS: Based on their mode of action, which is different from that of clinically approved anti-HIV drugs, PDPs are good candidates for further development into new drugs and to be included in future combination regimens.",

        "abstract": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is a zinc metallopeptidase containing two homologous domains. While the C-domain plays a major role in blood pressure regulation, the N-domain hydrolyzes the antifibrotic agent N-acetyl-Ser-Asp-Lys-Pro. Thus, N-domain selective (N-selective) inhibitors could be useful in the treatment of conditions relating to excessive tissue fibrosis. New keto-ACE analogues were designed that contained functionalities considered important for N-selective inhibitor RXP407 binding, namely, a P(2) Asp, N-acetyl group, and C-terminal amide. Such functionalities were incorporated to assess the structural determinants for N-selective binding in a novel inhibitor template. Inhibitors containing a C-terminal amide and modified P(2)' group were poor inhibitors of the N-domain, with several of these displaying improved inhibition of the C-domain. Molecules with both a C-terminal amide and P(2) Asp were also poor inhibitors and not N-selective. Compounds containing a free C-terminus, a P(2) Asp and protecting group displayed a change of more than 1000-fold N-selectivity compared with the parent molecule. Molecular docking models revealed interaction of these P(2) groups with S(2) residues Tyr369 and Arg381. This study emphasizes the importance of P(2) functionalities in allowing for improved N-selective binding and provides further rationale for the design of N-selective inhibitors, which could be useful in treating tissue fibrosis.",

Although GPR55 has been implicated in several (patho)physiologic functions, its role remains enigmatic owing mainly to the lack of selective GPR55 antagonists. Here we show that the compound CID16020046 ((4-[4-(3-hydroxyphenyl)-3-(4-methylphenyl)-6-oxo-1H,4H,5H,6H-pyrrolo[3,4-c]pyrazol-5-yl] benzoic acid) is a selective GPR55 antagonist. In yeast cells expressing human GPR55, CID16020046 antagonized agonist-induced receptor activation. In human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cells stably expressing human GPR55, the compound behaved as an antagonist on LPI-mediated Ca2+ release and extracellular signal-regulated kinases activation, but not in HEK293 cells expressing cannabinoid receptor 1 or 2 (CB1 or CB2). CID16020046 concentration dependently inhibited LPI-induced activation of nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT), nuclear factor kappa of activated B cells (NF-kappaB) and serum response element, translocation of NFAT and NF-kappaB, and GPR55 internalization. It reduced LPI-induced wound healing in primary human lung microvascular endothelial cells and reversed LPI-inhibited platelet aggregation, suggesting a novel role for GPR55 in platelet and endothelial cell function.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Although all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) can bring about complete remission of acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL), the incidence of early recurrence is considerably high. Thus, chemotherapeutic agents, such as anthracycline agents or cytosine arabinoside (AraC), are generally co-administered with ATRA. The therapeutic outcome of APL patients has significantly improved by chemo-differentiation therapy. Late-phase toxicities, such as cardiotoxicity and secondary carcinogenesis, are becoming clinically important. Therefore, we must identify the most suitable chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of APL. METHODS: We examined the effects of ICRF-193 and several other anticancer drugs on the growth and differentiation of APL cell lines (NB4 and HT-93) and other myeloid leukemia cell lines (HL-60 and U937). RESULTS: If anticancer agents were available that not only inhibited the proliferation of APL cells but also induced their differentiation, they would be very useful for the treatment of APL. DNR slightly induced the differentiation of APL cells. On the other hand, other DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors, such as ICRF-154 and ICRF-193, significantly induced the differentiation of APL cell lines and leukemia cells freshly isolated from APL patients. These drugs effectively cooperated with ATRA in inhibiting the growth and inducing the differentiation of APL cells, whereas DNR did not. The incidence of cardiotoxicity and secondary carcinogenesis associated with ICRF-193 are much lower than that with DNR. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that ICRF-193 may be useful in the treatment of patients with APL.",

        "abstract": "1. Histidine decarboxylase activity of rat stomach fluctuates depending upon the functional state of the stomach. This varying enzyme activity poses special problems in assessing the effectiveness of enzyme inhibitors. After vagal denervation gastric histidine decarboxylase is markedly activated and remains at a high, stable level, which is unaffected by the functional state of the stomach. Thus it appears that vagally denervated rats are well suited for studies on histidine decarboxylase inhibitors.2. In vivo, brocresine (NSD-1055) was found to be a more effective inhibitor of gastric DOPA decarboxylase than of gastric histidine decarboxylase. With the fairly high dose given (200 mg/kg) the inhibition of histidine decarboxylase was at most 75-85% and quite short-lasting. The DOPA decarboxylase activity, which was not affected by vagal denervation, was inhibited more than 95% by brocresine; this inhibition was longer-lasting.3. Cycloheximide, which probably lowers gastric histidine decarboxylase activity by inhibiting enzyme synthesis, was maximally effective at a dose level as low as 1 mg/kg. Gastric DOPA decarboxylase was not inhibited by cycloheximide. Vagotomized rats and control rats responded similarly.4. Combined treatment of vagally denervated rats with brocresine and cycloheximide resulted in a rapid and persistent reduction of the histidine decarboxylase activity. It is concluded that the failure of brocresine alone to induce a lasting inhibition of histidine decarboxylase is due to continuous, rapid synthesis of new enzyme.5. The calculated half-life of gastric histidine decarboxylase was 75 min in vagally denervated rats and 45 min in normal fasted rats. The results suggest that the increased enzyme activity after vagal denervation is caused by an increased rate of enzyme synthesis.",

Lipid A is required for bacterial growth and virulence, and inhibition of its biosynthesis is lethal to bacteria.

Inhibitors of LpxC have previously been shown to have antibiotic activities. We have screened a metalloenzyme inhibitor library for antibacterial activities against an Escherichia coli strain with reduced LpxC activity. From this screen, a series of sulfonamide derivatives of the alpha-(R)-amino hydroxamic acids, exemplified by BB-78484 and BB-78485, have been identified as having potent inhibitory activities against LpxC in an in vitro assay. Leads from this series showed gram-negative selective activities against members of the Enterobacteriaceae, Serratia marcescens, Morganella morganii, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Burkholderia cepacia. BB-78484 was bactericidal against E. coli, achieving 3-log killing in 4 h at a concentration 4 times above the MIC, as would be predicted for an inhibitor of lipid A biosynthesis. E. coli mutants with decreased susceptibility to BB-78484 were selected. Analysis of these mutants revealed that resistance arose as a consequence of mutations in the fabZ or lpxC genes.

        "abstract": "Some fluoroquinolone antibiotics (FQs) become toxic and mutagenic upon exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UV). Topoisomerase inhibition has been proposed as one possible mechanism involved in this photochemical genotoxicity. To study this reaction, inhibition of the human topoisomerase IIalpha enzyme by four FQs varying in photochemical genotoxic potency (Bay y3118 [y3118] &gt; Lomefloxacin [Lmx] &gt; Ciprofloxacin [Cpx] &gt; Moxifloxacin [Mox]) was measured in vitro in the presence of UVA irradiation. None of the FQs inhibited topoisomerase IIalpha in the absence of irradiation. In contrast, with irradiation at 365 nm, the potent photochemically genotoxic y3118 produced strong inhibition of the enzyme by 15% and Cpx caused a weak 5% inhibition, but the more photochemically genotoxic Lmx only showed a transient inhibitory effect at one concentration and one irradiation dose. The photostable Mox had no effect with irradiation. Topoisomerase IIalpha inhibition by y3118 only occurred when the FQ, DNA, and enzyme were simultaneously present in the UVA-irradiated reaction mixture and was abolished in the absence of ATP, indicating the possible formation of a ternary structure. The y3118 photochemical topoisomerase inhibition correlated with the increased irradiation-mediated binding of radiolabeled FQ to DNA:topoisomerase complexes and was irreversible, like that of the topoisomerase poison, etoposide, without irradiation. The inhibitory effect of photoactivated y3118 on topoisomerase IIalpha was also observed in the presence of the antioxidant TEMPO, indicating that reactive oxygen species were not involved in the inhibition. These observations demonstrate that some but not all photochemically genotoxic FQs inhibit human topoisomerase IIalpha, possibly by UV-induced affinity of FQs to DNA:topoisomerase complexes.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The nuclear hormone 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3) (1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3)) acts through the transcription factor vitamin D receptor (1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) receptor, VDR) via combined contact with the retinoid X receptor (RXR), coactivator proteins and specific DNA binding sites (1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) response elements, VDREs). Ligand-mediated conformational changes of the VDR are the basis of the molecular mechanisms of nuclear 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) signaling. Cell-specific VDR antagonists would allow to dissect and fine regulate the pleiotropic 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3) endocrine system affecting the regulation of calcium homeostasis, bone mineralization and other cellular functions. RESULTS: Two carboxylic ester analogues of 1alpha,25(OH)(2)D(3), ZK159222 and ZK168281, which have additional cyclopropyl rings and allylic alcohol substructures in their side chain, were characterized in different 1alpha, 25(OH)(2)D(3) target tissues as functional antagonists of 1alpha, 25(OH)(2)D(3) signaling. In all tested systems, ZK168281 showed lower residual agonistic activity and higher antagonistic effects than ZK159222, but the strength of these effects was cell-specific. Both antagonists were shown to act via the same mechanisms: they selectively stabilize an antagonistic conformation of the ligand-binding domain of the VDR within VDR-RXR-VDRE complexes, which then inhibits the interaction of the VDR with coactivator proteins and an induction of transactivation. Interestingly, cells that have been treated with antagonists were found to contain VDR-RXR heterodimers in a different conformation than cells that were stimulated with an agonist. Moreover, the strength of the functional antagonism of ZK159222 and ZK168281 appears to depend on the VDR/RXR expression ratio and high RXR levels were found to reduce the antagonistic effect of both compounds. In support of this observation, the overexpression of an transactivation function 2 (AF-2) deletion mutant of RXR resulted for both ZK159222 and ZK168281 in a reduced agonistic activity and an increased antagonistic effect. CONCLUSIONS: A novel, more potent VDR antagonist, ZK168281, was identified, which stabilizes VDR-RXR heterodimers in living cells in a different conformation than agonists. In addition, the VDR/RXR ratio was found as the major discriminating factor for understanding cell-specific effects of VDR antagonists.",

OBJECTIVES: To determine if administration of tifacogin (recombinant TFPI) provides mortality benefit in patients with severe sepsis and elevated international normalized ratio (INR) and to assess tifacogin safety in severe sepsis, including patients with low INR. DESIGN AND SETTING: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, phase 3 clinical trial conducted from March 21, 2000, through September 27, 2001, in 245 hospitals in 17 countries in North America, Europe, and Israel. PATIENTS: The primary efficacy population consisted of 1754 patients (&gt; or =18 years) with severe sepsis and a high INR (&gt; or =1.2) randomly assigned to intravenous infusion of either tifacogin (0.025 mg/kg per hour for 96 hours, n = 880) or placebo (arginine citrate buffer, n = 874), and 201 patients with a low INR (&lt;1.2) randomly assigned to receive the same dose of either tifacogin or placebo. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: All-cause 28-day mortality. RESULTS: Overall mortality at 28 days in the tifacogin-treated group (n = 880) vs the placebo group (n = 874) for high INR was 34.2% vs 33.9%, respectively (P =.88, Pearson chi2 test; P =.75, logistic regression model). None of the protocol-specified secondary end points differed between the tifacogin vs placebo groups. An analysis on the first 722 patients demonstrated a mortality rate of 38.9% for placebo vs 29.1% for tifacogin (P =.006, Pearson chi2 test). Tifacogin significantly attenuated prothrombin fragment 1.2 and thrombin:antithrombin complex levels (P&lt;.001, 2-sample t test) in patients with high and low INR. Overall mortality was lower in the tifacogin response in patients with low INR (12%; n = 83) vs placebo (22.9%; n = 118) (P =.051, Pearson chi2 test; P =.03, logistic regression model). There was an increase in serious adverse events with bleeding in the tifacogin group in both cohorts (6.5% tifacogin and 4.8% placebo for high INR; 6.0% tifacogin and 3.3% placebo for low INR). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with tifacogin had no effect on all-cause mortality in patients with severe sepsis and high INR.

Antibodies were raised in rabbits after immunization with lysil derivatives of zabicipril or zabiciprilat coupled with bovine serum albumin. Assays were performed in 96-well microtiter plates coated with a monoclonal antibody raised against rabbit immunoglobulin G, thus ensuring rapid separation of free and bound fractions of the tracer. The analysis does not require any extraction step. In the case of the assay of zabiciprilat, interference generated by endogenous angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) was eliminated by the addition of perindoprilat, another ACE inhibitor. Perindoprilat was not recognized by the antibodies (cross-reactivity &lt; 0.01%) and did not affect assay efficiency. The specificity of the assays was checked by high-performance liquid chromatography of human plasma samples obtained after oral administration of 2 mg of zabicipril. No metabolites or endogenous substances were detected. The mean reproducibility was 15% for the assay of zabicipril and 19% for the assay of zabiciprilat. The quantification limits were 1.2 ng/ml for the zabicipril assay and 0.8 ng/ml for the zabiciprilat assay. These assays are therefore suitable for pharmacokinetic studies and drug monitoring in clinical studies.",

        "abstract": "Histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors are emerging as a promising new treatment strategy in hematologic malignancies. Here we show that NVP-LAQ824, a novel hydroxamic acid derivative, induces apoptosis at physiologically achievable concentrations (median inhibitory concentration [IC50] of 100 nM at 24 hours) in multiple myeloma (MM) cell lines resistant to conventional therapies. MM.1S myeloma cell proliferation was also inhibited when cocultured with bone marrow stromal cells, demonstrating ability to overcome the stimulatory effects of the bone marrow microenvironment. Importantly, NVP-LAQ824 also inhibited patient MM cell growth in a dose- and time-dependent manner. NVP-LAQ824-induced apoptotic signaling includes up-regulation of p21, caspase cascade activation, and poly (adenosine diphosphate [ADP]) ribose (PARP) cleavage. Apoptosis was confirmed with cell cycle analysis and annexin-propidium iodide staining. Interestingly, treatment of MM cells with NVPLAQ824 also led to proteasome inhibition, as determined by reduced proteasome chymotrypsin-like activity and increased levels of cellular polyubiquitin conjugates. Finally, a study using NVP-LAQ824 in a preclinical murine myeloma model provides in vivo relevance to our in vitro studies. Taken together, these findings provide the framework for NVP-LAQ824 as a novel therapeutic in MM.",

        "abstract": "Matrix Metalloproteinase-2 (MMP-2) is an enzyme that degrades components of the extracellular matrix and thus plays a pivotal role in cell migration during physiological and pathological processes (e.g. gastric, pancrcreatic, prostate, and breast cancer). MMP-2 expression is dependent on extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN), Her2/neu, growth factors, cytokines, and hormones. Pro-MMP-2 activation needs MT1-MMP and TIMP-2 contribution. The active forms of MMPs subsequently release a cascade of activation of the remaining pro-MMPs. Inactivation of the physiological function of MMPs, or even pro-MMPs, is accomplished by non-covalent TIMP binding. The detection of active MMP-2 alone or the rate of pro-MMP-2 and active MMP-2 is considered a very sensitive indicator of cancer metastasis. Modulation of MMP-2 expression and activation through specific inhibitors and activators may thus provide a new mechanism for breast cancer treatment. Degradation of the cellular network established by adhesion molecules such as E-cadherin or ALCAM/CD166 causes tumor tissue relaxation, increases metastasis, and correlates with shortened survival in patients with primary breast carcinoma. A low level of MMP-2 is linked to favorable prognosis in patients with a hormone receptor-negative tumor, usually associated with high risk. Blocking MMP-2 secretion and activation during breast carcinoma development may decrease metastasis. Besides zoledronic acid and bisphosphonates, the new synthetic metalloproteinase blockers (MMPIs) batimastat, marimastat, and tetracycline derivates have been investigated in anticancer therapy. Recent research shows that modified synthetic siRNA targeting TIMP-2 may also regulate the balance between MMPs and TIMP-2 and thus decrease the degradation of extracellular matrix and prevent distant metastasis.",

        "abstract": "The testis is known to be a site of corticosterone action, and testosterone production in Leydig cells is directly inhibited by glucocorticoids. Glucocorticoids bind to both glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) and to mineralocorticoid receptors (MRs). In Leydig cells, selective mineralocorticoid binding could result from oxidative inactivation of glucocorticoid by type 1 and/or 2 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11betaHSD), as both isoforms are expressed. However, it remains unclear whether Leydig cells express MRs and respond directly to mineralocorticoid action. Therefore, the aims of the present study were to ascertain: (1) whether MR mRNA, protein and receptor binding are present in Leydig cells; and (2) if the mineralocorticoid modulates testosterone production. The mRNA encoding MR, as well as protein, and binding activity were each observed in adult rat Leydig cells. MR-ligand binding specificity within isolated Leydig cells was evaluated further by measuring displacement of MR binding to aldosterone by corticosterone in the presence and absence of carbenoxolone, an inhibitor of 11betaHSD1 and 2 that decreases conversion to biologically inert 11-dehydrocorticosterone. Carbenoxolone inhibited 11betaHSD oxidative activity, and reduced corticosterone-binding by 50%. Mineralocorticoid effects on steroidogenesis were assessed in the presence of aldosterone (0.01-10 nM) with or without the MR antagonist, RU28318. Aldosterone induced dose-dependent increases in both basal and luteinizing hormone-stimulated testosterone production. RU28318 eliminated the increase, indicating that these effects of aldosterone were mediated by the MR. The effects of aldosterone and luteinizing hormone (0.1 ng/ml) on testosterone production were synergistic, suggesting that the two hormones increased steroidogenesis through separate pathways. We conclude that Leydig cells express MRs and that testosterone production is subject to regulation by aldosterone.",

Here, we describe studies on the antitumor activity of a novel topoisomerase II inhibitor, ER-37328 [12,13-dihydro-5-[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl]-4H-benzo[c]pyrimido[5,6,1- jk]carbazole-4,6,10(5H,11H)-trione hydrochloride]. ER-37328 inhibited topoisomerase II activity at 10 times lower concentration than etoposide in relaxation assay and induced double-strand DNA cleavage within 1 h in murine leukemia P388 cells, in a bell-shaped manner with respect to drug concentration. The maximum amount of DNA cleavage was obtained at 2 microM. Like etoposide, ER-37328 (2 microM) induced topoisomerase II-DNA cross-linking in P388 cells. A spectroscopic study of ER-37328 mixed with DNA demonstrated that ER-37328 has apparent binding activity to DNA. ER-37328 showed potent growth-inhibitory activity against a panel of 21 human cancer cell lines [mean (50% growth-inhibitory concentration) GI50 = 59 nM]. COMPARE analysis according to the National Cancer Institute screening protocol showed that the pattern of the growth-inhibitory effect of ER-37328 was similar to that of etoposide, but different from that of doxorubicin. Studies on etoposide-, amsacrine [4'-(9-acridinylamino)methanesulfon-m-anisidide (m-AMSA)]-, and camptothecin-resistant P388 cell lines showed that: (a) etoposide- and m-AMSA-resistant P388 cell lines were partially resistant to ER-37328 compared with the parental cell line; and (b) a camptothecin-resistant cell line showed no cross-resistance to ER-37328. In addition, ER-37328 overcame P-glycoprotein-mediated resistance. In vivo, ER-37328 produced potent tumor regression of Colon 38 carcinoma inoculated s.c., and its activity was superior to that of etoposide or doxorubicin. These results indicate that ER-37328 inhibits topoisomerase II activity through the formation of topoisomerase II-DNA cleavable complex and has potent antitumor activity both in vitro and in vivo.",

Inhibition of HIF-1alpha is considered as a promising approach in cancer therapy. The purpose of this study was to test the efficacy of a novel HIF-1alpha inhibitor PX-478 as a radiosensitizer under normoxic and hypoxic conditions in vitro. PC3 and DU 145 prostate carcinoma cells were treated with PX-478 for 20 hr, and HIF-1alpha protein level and clonogenic cell survival were determined under normoxia and hypoxia. Effects of PX-478 on cell cycle distribution and phosphorylation of H2AX histone were evaluated. PX-478 decreased HIF-1alpha protein in PC3 and DU 145 cells. PX-478 produced cytotoxicity in both cell lines with enhanced toxicity under hypoxia for DU-145. PX-478 (20 mumol/L) enhanced the radiosensitivity of PC3 cells irradiated under normoxic and hypoxic condition with enhancement factor (EF) 1.4 and 1.56, respectively. The drug was less effective in inhibiting HIF-1alpha and enhancing radiosensitivity of DU 145 cells compared to PC3 cells with EF 1.13 (normoxia) and 1.25 (hypoxia) at 50 mumol/L concentration. PX-478 induced S/G2M arrest in PC3 but not in DU 145 cells. Treatment of PC3 and DU 145 cells with the drug resulted in phosphorylation of H2AX histone and prolongation of gammaH2AX expression in the irradiated cells. PX-478 is now undergoing Phase I clinical trials as an oral agent. Although the precise mechanism of enhancement of radiosensitivity remains to be identified, this study suggests a potential role for PX-478 as a clinical radiation enhancer.",

Animals were stressed for 10 days before treatment with ORG 34116 started (25 mg/kg p.o. for 28 days). Stress induced a decrease in body weight, which just failed significance, whereas ORG 34116 did not affect body weight in stress and control animals. ORG 34116 enhanced the stress-induced increase in the concentration of urinary-free cortisol, although no differences between the different experimental groups existed during the last week of treatment.

        "abstract": "A rapid screening assay for chemicals inhibiting 11beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (11beta-HSD) type 1 or type 2 using lysates from stably transfected cells was developed. Here, we tested a series of environmental chemicals for anti-11beta-HSD activities. Inhibition of 11beta-HSD2, which may cause cortisol-dependent activation of the mineralocorticoid receptor with sodium retention and hypertension, was observed for several compounds, with diethylcarbamate being the most potent inhibitor (IC50 6.3 microM). Abietic acid inhibited both 11beta-HSD1 (IC50 27 microM for reduction and 2.8 microM for oxidation) and 11beta-HSD2 (IC50 12 microM). Our results demonstrate for the first time that flavanone selectively inhibits 11beta-HSD1 reductase activity: this enzyme being considered as essential for the local activation of glucocorticoids and representing a potential target for the therapeutic treatment of diabetes type 2. Flavanone and 2'-hydroxyflavanone efficiently inhibited reductive (IC50 18 and 10 microM) but not oxidative activity. We observed a reduced inhibitory effect of hydroxylated flavanone derivatives and of flavones containing a double-bond between atom C2 and C3. Flavanone was specific for 11beta-HSD1 and did not inhibit 11beta-HSD2. Our results reveal that a variety of environmental compounds exert distinct inhibitory effects on 11beta-HSD1 and 11beta-HSD2, opening the possibility for selectively modulating local cortisone/cortisol availability in vivo.",

        "abstract": "Clinical use of ATP-competitive inhibitors of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase domain can lead to an acquired drug resistant mutant L858R&amp;T790M which dramatically reduces binding affinity relative to a prevalent cancer causing mutation L858R. In this study, we have used molecular dynamics (MD) computer simulations, free energy calculations (MM-GBSA method), and per-residue footprint analysis to characterize binding of three inhibitors (erlotinib, gefitinib, and AEE788) with wildtype EGFR and three mutants. The goal is to characterize how variation in structure and energy correlate with changes in experimental activities and to deduce origins of drug resistance. For seven fold resistance values, each computed from the difference of two independent computer simulations, excellent agreement was obtained with available experimental data (r2 = 0.84). Importantly, the results correctly predict that affinity will increase as a result of L858R and decrease due to L858R&amp;T790M. Per-residue analysis shows an increase in favorable packing at the site of the methionine mutation reaffirming that a steric clash hypothesis is unlikely; however, large losses in van der Waals, Coulombic, and H-bond interactions strongly suggest that resistance is not due solely to changes in affinity for the native substrate ATP as recently proposed. Instead, the present results indicate that drug resistance more likely involves disruption of favorable interactions, including a water-mediated H-bond network between the ligands and residues T854, T790, and Q791, which could have important implication for guiding rational design of inhibitors with improved resistance profiles.",

The involvement of vascular Ang II-forming enzymes in the progression of AAA was studied. METHODS: ApoE-deficient mice were infused with Ang II (1,000 ng/kg/min) for 4 weeks and evaluated until 20 weeks after the Ang II infusion. Just after and 20 weeks after stopping the Ang II infusion, the degree of AAA, as well as the ACE and chymase activities, was evaluated. An Ang II receptor blocker (candesartan, 30 mg/kg/day) and an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor (lisinopril, 60 mg/kg/day) were given for 20 weeks after stopping the Ang II infusion. RESULTS: The aortic diameter expanded just after stopping the Ang II infusion and progressed for a further 20 weeks after the infusion was stopped. Just after stopping the infusion, aortic ACE and chymase activities were significantly increased, but only the increase in chymase activity continued until 20 weeks after the infusion was stopped. Candesartan and lisinopril significantly attenuated aortic diameter expansion.

Idrapril (0.04-23 mumol/kg i.v.) lowered the blood pressure dose dependently, up to 20-35%, in different models of hypertension (sodium-depleted spontaneously hypertensive rat, two-kidney-one-clip renal hypertensive rat, and aortic-coarctated rat), its profile being similar to that of captopril in terms of potency and efficacy. Idrapril and captopril reduced the blood pressure and potentiated substance P-induced bronchoconstriction in the guinea pig to the same extent, suggesting a similar degree of ACE inhibition in the circulation. However, idrapril potentiated capsaicin-induced bronchoconstriction (a model that has been related to the liability of ACE inhibitors to produce cough in patients) less effectively than captopril.

        "abstract": "Androgen receptor (AR) is a ligand-activated transcription factor that requires androgen binding to initiate a series of molecular events leading to specific gene activation. AR has been suggested to form an antiparallel homodimer based on the characteristics of high affinity interaction between the amino (N) and carboxyl (C) termini of it. Recently, it is suggested that AR N-to-C interaction is critical for the ability of this receptor to up-regulate the transcription of androgen-responsive genes, and may be a new target for treatment of prostate cancer (PCa). In this study, we investigated the effect of N-terminal (1-34) peptide of AR (ARN34) on androgen-dependent function in PCa cell. Ectopic expression of ARN34 suppressed both androgen-dependent AR N-to-C interaction and prostate specific antigen transcription. Ectopic expression of ARN34 also caused delaying translocation to the nucleus and the decreasing stability of the AR. Stable expression of ARN34 suppressed androgen-dependent cell growth of LNCaP cells. Moreover, transactivation and cell growth of the AR variant in LNCaP cells by the AR antagonist, hydroxyflutamide, were also inhibited by ARN34. Although treatment of LNCaP cells with androgen drove transition of cells from G1 to S-phase, the cells expressing ARN34 were inhibited to enter into S phase in the presence of androgen. This cell cycle arrest was attended by decrease in cyclin E levels and cyclin-dependent-kinase 2 activity, and increase in p27 levels. Our results demonstrated that disruption of AR N-to-C interaction caused by ARN34 leads to AR dysfunction and inhibition of AR-mediated prostate cancer cell growth. This approach is thus considered to provide a useful therapeutic opinion for blocking AR-mediated PCa growth.",

TAK-802 potently inhibited human-erythrocyte-derived acetylcholinesterase activity with an IC(50) value of 1.5 nM, which represented a potency 30 and 250 times greater than that of the two carbamate acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, neostigimine and distigmine, respectively. Unlike the carbamate acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, TAK-802 exhibits high selectivity for acetylcholinesterase inhibition over butyrylcholinesterase inhibition. In an assay conducted to measure the muscarinic and nicotinic actions, TAK-802 was found to exhibit higher selectivity for muscarinic actions over nicotinic actions in comparison to distigmine. Both TAK-802 and distigmine increased isovolumetric bladder contractions in rats and guinea pigs in a dose-dependent manner, with a minimum effective dose (MED) of 0.01 and 0.03 mg/kg i.v., respectively, in rats, and 0.01 and 0.1 mg/kg i.v., respectively, in guinea pigs. The effects of both the drugs were completely abolished by atropine. These results suggest that TAK-802 and other acetylcholinesterase inhibitors can effectively increase reflex bladder contractions by increasing the efficacy of acetylcholine released by nerve impulses. On the other hand, bethanechol, a muscarinic agonist, markedly changed the pattern of distension-induced bladder contractions when administered at the dose of 1 mg/kg i.v., and it did not necessarily augment well-coordinated bladder contractions. Thus, considering that it has some selectivity for muscarinic action, TAK-802 might be expected to be useful in the treatment of voiding dysfunction caused by impaired detrusor contractility.",

A-841720 significantly reduced formalin-induced behaviours and complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA)-induced tactile allodynia, starting at doses of 1 and 10 mg/kg, respectively.

In contextual-fear conditioning, A-841720, given at the dose of 10 mg/kg before acquisition, significantly reduced freezing behaviour tested 24 h later. In the same task, repeated treatment for 5 days did not reduce the impairing effect of the challenge dose, indicating a lack of tolerance development. In a passive-avoidance task, A-841720 at 10 mg/kg administered before acquisition, significantly reduced the latency to enter the dark box on the retention test. Given that complete Freund's adjuvant is a better measure of analgesia, these results indicate that the selective mGluR1 antagonist A-841720 has analgesic potential in a dose range at which it also produces memory impairments.

The present study evaluates effects of an ACE inhibitor (ie, fosinopril) intervention on novel cardiovascular risk factors. METHODS: Data are from the Trial of Angiotensin Converting Enzyme Inhibition and Novel Cardiovascular Risk Factors (TRAIN) study, a double-blind, crossover, randomized, placebo-controlled trial enrolling subjects &gt; or =55 years old with high cardiovascular disease risk profile. Biomarkers of hemostasis (ie, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1, D-dimer), inflammation (ie, C-reactive protein, interleukin-6), and endothelial function (ie, endothelin 1, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1) were measured at the baseline, at the midterm, and at end of follow-up (after 1 year) clinic visits. Paired t test analyses (after Sidak's adjustment, P &lt; .009) were performed to compare biomarkers modifications after fosinopril/placebo interventions. RESULTS: Mean age of the sample (n = 290, women 43.4%) was 66.0 years old. No significant differences were reported for C-reactive protein, interleukin 6, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1, vascular cell adhesion molecule 1, and endothelin 1 levels in the comparisons between fosinopril and placebo interventions. D-dimer was the only biomarker showing a significant difference between fosinopril intervention (median 0.32 microg/mL, interquartile range 0.22-0.52 microg/mL) and placebo (median 0.29 microg/mL, interquartile range 0.20-0.47 microg/mL, P = .007) when analyses were restricted to participants with higher compliance to treatment and receiving the maximum ACE inhibitor dosage.

Nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) is involved in regulation of inflammation and cell survival in a variety of cell types. We tested a hypothesis that selective inhibition of NF-kappaB by expression of a mutated, nondegradable inhibitor of NF-kappaB, IkappaB-alphaM, would inhibit proinflammatory cytokine expression and proliferation in human vascular smooth muscle cell. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Smooth muscle cells were cultured from internal mammary artery and infected with recombinant adenovirus vectors. RESULTS: Adenoviral expression of IkappaB-alphaM inhibited diverse signal-triggered cellular IkappaB-alpha degradation, subsequent NF-kappaB activation, and transactivation of proinflammatory cytokine genes. Expression of IkappaB-alphaM in low-density VSMC led to a 60% reduction in serum-stimulated cell growth and a 10% increment in apoptotic incidence but was without effect in high-density cultures. Coexpression of NF-kappaB p65 attenuated apoptosis in low-density cells induced by IkappaB-alphaM. Therefore, the susceptibility to apoptosis induction in the low-density cells correlated with lower constitutive NF-kappaB activity. The induction of apoptosis by IkappaB-alphaM and the rescue by NF-kappaB p65 might be explained by mutual control of NF-kappaB p65 and IkappaB-alphaM access to the nucleus.

Previous studies have shown that macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF) is important for the differentiation of osteoclasts. In this study, we investigated whether an inhibitor of M-CSF receptor (c-Fms) suppresses osteoclast-dependent osteolysis in bone metastatic lesions. We developed small molecule inhibitors against ligand-dependent phosphorylation of c-Fms and examined the effects of these compounds on osteolytic bone destruction in a bone metastasis model. We discovered a novel quinoline-urea derivative, Ki20227 (N-{4-[(6,7-dimethoxy-4-quinolyl)oxy]-2-methoxyphenyl}-N'-[1-(1,3-thiazole-2-yl)ethyl]urea), which is a c-Fms tyrosine kinase inhibitor. The IC(50)s of Ki20227 to inhibit c-Fms, vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 (KDR), stem cell factor receptor (c-Kit), and platelet-derived growth factor receptor beta were found to be 2, 12, 451, and 217 nmol/L, respectively. Ki20227 did not inhibit other kinases tested, such as fms-like tyrosine kinase-3, epidermal growth factor receptor, or c-Src (c-src proto-oncogene product). Ki20227 was also found to inhibit the M-CSF-dependent growth of M-NFS-60 cells but not the M-CSF-independent growth of A375 human melanoma cells in vitro. Furthermore, in an osteoclast-like cell formation assay using mouse bone marrow cells, Ki20227 inhibited the development of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive osteoclast-like cells in a dose-dependent manner. In in vivo studies, oral administration of Ki20227 suppressed osteoclast-like cell accumulation and bone resorption induced by metastatic tumor cells in nude rats following intracardiac injection of A375 cells. Moreover, Ki20227 decreased the number of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase-positive osteoclast-like cells on bone surfaces in ovariectomized (ovx) rats. These findings suggest that Ki20227 inhibits osteolytic bone destruction through the suppression of M-CSF-induced osteoclast accumulation in vivo.

We have discovered sergliflozin, a prodrug of a novel selective SGLT2 inhibitor, based on benzylphenol glucoside. In structure, it belongs to a new category of SGLT2 inhibitors and its skeleton differs from that of phlorizin, a nonselective SGLT inhibitor. We investigated its pharmacological properties and potencies in vitro and in vivo. By examining a Chinese hamster ovary-K1 cell line stably expressing either human SGLT2 or human high-affinity sodium glucose cotransporter (SGLT1), we found sergliflozin-A (active form) to be a highly selective and potent inhibitor of human SGLT2. At pharmacological doses, sergliflozin, sergliflozin-A, and its aglycon had no effects on facilitative glucose transporter 1 activity, which was inhibited by phloretin (the aglycon of phlorizin). The transport maximum for glucose in the kidney was reduced by sergliflozin-A in normal rats. As a result of this effect, orally administered sergliflozin increased urinary glucose excretion in mice, rats, and dogs in a dose-dependent manner. In an oral glucose tolerance test in diabetic rats, sergliflozin exhibited glucose-lowering effects independently of insulin secretion. Any glucose excretion induced by sergliflozin did not affect normoglycemia or electrolyte balance. These data indicate that selective inhibition of SGLT2 increases urinary glucose excretion by inhibiting renal glucose reabsorption.

In this study the ginkgolide structure was modified in order to investigate the minimum structural requirements for glycine receptor antagonism. The five native ginkgolides and a series of 29 ginkgolide derivatives were characterized at the three glycine receptor subtypes alpha1, alpha1beta, and alpha2, which revealed that only minor changes in the ginkgolide skeleton were allowed for maintaining glycine receptor antagonism. A pharmacophore model was generated and applied in a virtual screening of a compound database (300000 compounds), resulting in the identification of 31 hits. Twenty-seven of these hits were screened for biological activity, but none displayed antagonist activity at the glycine receptors. This strongly suggests the importance of other pharmacophore components in the binding of ginkgolides to glycine receptors, and we propose that the structural rigidity of the ginkgolide molecule may be crucial for its glycine receptor activity.",

        "abstract": "Vasopressin is thought to play an important role, not only in the metabolism of water and electrolytes, but also in the regulation of renal hemodynamics. This year, great progress has been achieved in molecular biology of vasopressin receptors. First, the cloning of a complementary DNA, encoding the rat liver V1a arginine vasopressin receptor, was reported. The liver cDNA encodes a protein with seven putative transmembrane domains, which binds arginine vasopressin and related compounds with affinities similar to the native rat V1a receptor. The messenger RNA, corresponding to the cDNA, is distributed in rat tissues, known to contain V1a receptors. Second, the cloning of a complementary DNA encoding the rat kidney V2 arginine vasopressin receptor was also successful. The kidney cDNA encodes a protein with a transmembrane topography characteristic of G protein-coupled receptors. The receptor messenger RNA is detected only in the kidney. Last year, an orally active and specific vasopressin V1 receptor antagonist, OPC-21268 was first reported. The i.v. or p.o. administration of OPC-21268 dose-dependently inhibited vasopressin-induced vasoconstriction, while that induced by angiotensin II was not affected. OPC-21268 may have clinical potentials in certain hypertensive cardiovascular disorders. In addition, an orally active and specific vasopressin V2 receptor antagonist, OPC-31260 was also reported. Oral administration of OPC-31260 inhibited antidiuretic action of arginine vasopressin. OPC-31260 is thought to be useful in the treatment of certain disorders, such as the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of ADH (SIADH).",

In this study, we describe a small molecule TRPV4 channel activator, (N-((1S)-1-{[4-((2S)-2-{[(2,4-dichlorophenyl)sulfonyl]amino}-3-hydroxypropanoyl)-1-piperazinyl]carbonyl}-3-methylbutyl)-1-benzothiophene-2-carboxamide (GSK1016790A), which we have used as a valuable tool in investigating the role of TRPV4 in the urinary bladder. GSK1016790A elicited Ca2+ influx in mouse and human TRPV4-expressing human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells (EC50 values of 18 and 2.1 nM, respectively), and it evoked a dose-dependent activation of TRPV4 whole-cell currents at concentrations above 1 nM. In contrast, the TRPV4 activator 4alpha-phorbol 12,13-didecanoate (4alpha-PDD) was 300-fold less potent than GSK1016790A in activating TRPV4 currents. TRPV4 mRNA was detected in urinary bladder smooth muscle (UBSM) and urothelium of TRPV4+/+ mouse bladders. Western blotting and immunohistochemistry demonstrated protein expression in both the UBSM and urothelium that was absent in TRPV4-/- bladders. TRPV4 activation with GSK1016790A contracted TRPV4+/+ mouse bladders in vitro, both in the presence and absence of the urothelium, an effect that was undetected in TRPV4-/- bladders. Consistent with the effects on TRPV4 HEK whole-cell currents, 4alpha-PDD demonstrated a weak ability to contract bladder strips compared with GSK1016790A. In vivo, urodynamics in TRPV4+/+ and TRPV4-/- mice revealed an enhanced bladder capacity in the TRPV4-/- mice. Infusion of GSK1016790A into the bladders of TRPV4+/+ mice induced bladder overactivity with no effect in TRPV4-/- mice. Overall TRPV4 plays an important role in urinary bladder function that includes an ability to contract the bladder as a result of the expression of TRPV4 in the UBSM.",

Furthermore, it was found that the ligands at best exhibited a 140 times lower binding affinity to the membrane-bound IRAP/AT4 receptor than Ang IV.

Bath application of histamine elicited a concentration-dependent excitation of both spontaneous firing (n=19) and silent (n=7) LVN neurons. Moreover, histamine induced a stable inward current in the LVN neurons (n=5) and the histamine-induced depolarization of membrane potential persisted in the presence of tetrodotoxin (n=4), indicating a direct post-synaptic effect of the histamine on the LVN neurons. Selective histamine H2 receptor antagonist ranitidine effectively blocked the histamine-evoked excitatory responses on the LVN neurons (n=4), but selective histamine H1 receptor antagonist triprolidine did not (n=4). In addition, selective histamine H2 receptor agonist dimaprit (n=3) rather than 2-pyridylethylamine (n=4), a selective histamine H1 receptor agonist, mimicked the excitatory action of histamine on LVN neurons. The results demonstrate that histamine excites the LVN neurons via post-synaptic histamine H2 receptors and suggest that the central histaminergic projection arising from the hypothalamus may modulate LVN neurons activity and actively influence the vestibular reflexes and functions.",

Thus far, only nAChR agonists have been reported as being in development for pain, although nAChR antagonists could also have a potentially analgesic action. Various problems associated with the use of nAChR agonists as analgesics have been identified and measures suggested to overcome some of them. This review describes the nAChR agonists A-85380, tebanicline, ABT-366833, ABT-202, ABT-894, epibatidine analogs and SIB-1663, of which ABT-366833, ABT-202 and ABT-894 are currently undergoing development as pain therapeutics. In vivo studies of the pathomechanism of neuropathic pain indicate that targeting alpha3beta4 does not have a specific action on neuropathic pain, and that alpha3beta4 ligands cause side effects. On the other hand, alpha4beta2 receptors are specific for neuropathic pain, and ligands that bind preferentially to these receptors both effectively relieve pain and do not cause many adverse effects. This is the basis of the difference between the action of tebanicline, which binds with greater specificity to alpha3beta4 receptors, and ABT-366833, which binds more specifically to alpha4beta2 receptors.",

To investigate whether GPD-1116 (a PDE4 inhibitor) prevents murine lungs from developing cigarette smoke-induced emphysema, the senescence-accelerated mouse (SAM) P1 strain was exposed to either fresh air or cigarette smoke for 8 wk with or without oral administration of GPD-1116. We confirmed the development of smoke-induced emphysema in SAMP1 [air vs. smoke (means +/- SE); the mean linear intercepts (MLI), 52.9 +/- 0.8 vs. 68.4 +/- 4.2 microm, P &lt; 0.05, and destructive index (DI), 4.5% +/- 1.3% vs. 16.0% +/- 0.4%, P &lt; 0.01]. Emphysema was markedly attenuated by GPD-1116 (MLI = 57.0 +/- 1.4 microm, P &lt; 0.05; DI = 8.2% +/- 0.6%, P &lt; 0.01) compared with smoke-exposed SAMP1 without GPD-1116. Smoke-induced apoptosis of lung cells were also reduced by administration of GPD-1116. Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-12 activity in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) was increased by smoke exposure (air vs. smoke, 4.1 +/- 1.1 vs. 40.5 +/- 16.2 area/microg protein; P &lt; 0.05), but GPD-1116 significantly decreased MMP-12 activity in smoke-exposed mice (5.3 +/- 2.1 area/microg protein). However, VEGF content in lung tissues and BALF decreased after smoke exposure, and the decrease was not markedly restored by oral administration of GPD-1116. Our study suggests that GPD-1116 attenuates smoke-induced emphysema by inhibiting the increase of smoke-induced MMP-12 activity and protecting lung cells from apoptosis, but is not likely to alleviate cigarette smoke-induced decrease of VEGF in SAMP1 lungs.",

The structure-activity relationships (SAR) of the xanthines synthesized in binding to recombinant human A(2B) adenosine receptors (ARs) in HEK-293 cells (HEK-A(2B)) and at other AR subtypes were explored. The synthesized compounds showed A(2B) adenosine receptor affinity in the nanomolar range and good levels of selectivity evaluated in radioligand binding assays at human (h) A(1), A(2A), A(2B), and A(3) ARs. We introduced several heterocycles, such as pyrazole, isoxazole, pyridine, and pyridazine, at the 8-position of the xanthine nucleus and we have also investigated different spacers (substituted acetamide, oxyacetamide, and urea moieties) on the heterocycle introduced. Various groups at the 3- and 4-positions of phenylacetamide moiety were studied. This study allowed us to identify the derivatives 2-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-N-[5-(2,6-dioxo-1,3-dipropyl-2,3,6,7-tetrahydro-1H-purin-8-yl)-1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-3-yl]acetamide (29b, MRE2028F20) [K(i)(hA(2B)) = 38 nM, K(i)(hA(1),hA(2A),hA(3)) &gt;1000 nM], N-benzo[1,3]dioxol-5-yl-2-[5-(2,6-dioxo-1,3-dipropyl-2,3,6,7-tetrahydro-1H-purin-8-yl)-1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-3-yloxy]acetamide (62b, MRE2029F20) [K(i)(hA(2B)) = 5.5 nM, K(i)(hA(1),hA(2A),hA(3)) &gt; 1000 nM], and N-(3,4-dimethoxyphenyl)-2-[5-(2,6-dioxo-1,3-dipropyl-2,3,6,7-tetrahydro-1H-purin-8-yl)-1-methyl-1H-pyrazol-3-yloxy]acetamide (72b, MRE2030F20) [K(i)(hA(2B) = 12 nM, K(i)(hA(1),hA(2A), hA(3)) &gt; 1000 nM], which showed high affinity at the A(2B) receptor subtype and very good selectivity vs the other ARs. Substitution of the acetamide with an urea moiety afforded bioisosteric xanthines with good affinity and selectivity comparable to the acetamide derivatives. Substitution at the para-position of a 4-benzyloxy group of the phenylacetamido chain enhanced affinity at the A(2B) receptor [compound 30b (K(i)(hA(2B)) = 13 nM) vs compound 21b (K(i)(hA(2B) = 56 nM)] but did not favor selectivity. The derivatives with higher affinity at human A(2B) AR proved to be antagonists, in the cyclic AMP assay, capable of inhibiting the stimulatory effect of NECA (100 nM) with IC(50) values in the nanomolar range, a trend similar to that observed in the binding assay (62b, IC(50) = 38 nM; 72b, IC(50) = 46 nM).

        "abstract": "Microtubules are involved in a variety of essential cell functions. Their role during mitosis has made them a target for anti-cancer drugs. However development of resistance has limited their use. It has been established that enhanced beta3-tubulin expression is correlated with reduced response to antimicrotubule agent-based chemotherapy or worse outcome in a variety of tumor settings. However little is known regarding the regulation of beta3-tubulin expression. We investigated the regulatory mechanisms of expression of beta3-tubulin in the MCF-7 cell line, a model of hormone-dependent breast cancer. Exposure of MCF-7 cells to estradiol was found to induce beta3-tubulin mRNA as well as beta3-tubulin protein expression. Conversely, we did not observe induction of beta3-tubulin mRNA by estradiol in MDA-MB-231 cells which are negative for the estrogen receptor (ER). In order to determine whether beta3-tubulin up-regulation is mediated through the ER pathway, MCF-7 cells were exposed to two ER modulators. Exposure to tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator, completely abolished the beta3-tubulin mRNA induction due to estradiol in MCF-7 cells. This result was confirmed with fulvestrant, a pure antagonist of ER. These results demonstrate that the effect of estradiol on beta3-tubulin transcription is mediated through an ER dependent pathway.",

        "abstract": "Aldose reductase (ALR2) belongs to the aldo-keto reductase (AKR) superfamily of enzymes, is the first enzyme involved in the polyol pathway of glucose metabolism and has been linked to the pathologies associated with diabetes. Molecular modelling studies together with binding constant measurements for the four inhibitors Tolrestat, Minalrestat, quercetin and 3,5-dichlorosalicylic acid (DCL) were used to determine the type of inhibition, and correlate inhibitor potency and binding energies of the complexes with ALR2 and the homologous aldehyde reductase (ALR1), another member of the AKR superfamily. Our results show that the four inhibitors follow either uncompetitive or non-competitive inhibition pattern of substrate reduction for ALR1 and ALR2. Overall, there is correlation between the IC(50) (concentration giving 50% inhibition) values of the inhibitors for the two enzymes and the binding energies (DeltaH) of the enzyme-inhibitor complexes. Additionally, the results agree with the detailed structural information obtained by X-ray crystallography suggesting that the difference in inhibitor binding for the two enzymes is predominantly mediated by non-conserved residues. In particular, Arg312 in ALR1 (missing in ALR2) contributes favourably to the binding of DCL through an electrostatic interaction with the inhibitor's electronegative halide atom and undergoes a conformational change upon Tolrestat binding. In ALR2, Thr113 (Tyr116 in ALR1) forms electrostatic interactions with the fluorobenzyl moiety of Minalrestat and the 3- and 4-hydroxy groups on the phenyl ring of quercetin. Our modelling studies suggest that Minalrestat's binding to ALR1 is accompanied by a conformational change including the side chain of Tyr116 to achieve the selectivity for ALR1 over ALR2.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Intracellular cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in inflammatory cells and airway smooth muscle is critical to the modulation of inflammatory response generation. Phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4), an enzyme that catalyzes cAMP degradation, is therefore being actively explored as a molecular target for the treatment of airway inflammation, particularly asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The field has undergone major advances in optimizing generation of compounds with a safe therapeutic margin; however, most PDE4 inhibitors tested so far have unacceptable side effects, particularly nausea and vomiting. METHODS: We evaluated NIS-62949 in a wide range of in vitro and ex vivo cell-based assays to ascertain its anti-inflammatory potential. The compound was evaluated in murine models of lipopolysaccharide-induced endotoxemia and pulmonary neutrophilia. Parameters of airway inflammation, airway hyperreactivity and bronchoconstriction were evaluated in a guinea pig model of antigen-induced allergy. In order to assess the emetic potential, the compound was evaluated biochemically for binding to high-affinity rolipram-binding site. Subsequently, the compound was tested in a surrogate model for emesis, and the results obtained were correlated directly to tests conducted in a Beagle dog model. RESULTS: NIS-62949 is a potent, highly selective PDE4 inhibitor. The compound demonstrated potent ability to inhibit tumor necrosis factor-alpha release from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells, lymphocyte proliferation and cytokine production. The in vitro profile of NIS-62949 prompted further evaluation of the compound in vivo and the compound was found to be comparable to roflumilast in several experimental models of pulmonary inflammation. Importantly, NIS-62949 displayed a safer profile compared to roflumilast. CONCLUSIONS: Our results report the development of a promising, novel PDE4 inhibitor, NIS-62949, with a wider therapeutic window as compared to second-generation PDE4 inhibitors such as roflumilast.",

Here, we evaluated the effects of inhibiting the ubiquitination pathway at the level of the ubiquitin-activating enzyme UBA1 (E1). By immunoblotting, leukemia cell lines and primary patient samples had increased protein ubiquitination. Therefore, we examined the effects of genetic and chemical inhibition of the E1 enzyme. Knockdown of E1 decreased the abundance of ubiquitinated proteins in leukemia and myeloma cells and induced cell death. To further investigate effects of E1 inhibition in malignancy, we discovered a novel small molecule inhibitor, 3,5-dioxopyrazolidine compound, 1-(3-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)-4-[(5-nitro-2-furyl)methylene]-3,5-pyrazolidinedione (PYZD-4409). PYZD-4409 induced cell death in malignant cells and preferentially inhibited the clonogenic growth of primary acute myeloid leukemia cells compared with normal hematopoietic cells. Mechanistically, genetic or chemical inhibition of E1 increased expression of E1 stress markers. Moreover, BI-1 overexpression blocked cell death after E1 inhibition, suggesting ER stress is functionally important for cell death after E1 inhibition. Finally, in a mouse model of leukemia, intraperitoneal administration of PYZD-4409 decreased tumor weight and volume compared with control without untoward toxicity.

        "abstract": "Ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) mutated (ATM) is critical for cell cycle checkpoints and DNA repair. Thus, specific small molecule inhibitors targeting ATM could perhaps be developed into efficient radiosensitizers. Recently, a specific inhibitor of the ATM kinase, KU-55933, was shown to radiosensitize human cancer cells. Herein, we report on an improved analogue of KU-55933 (KU-60019) with K(i) and IC(50) values half of those of KU-55933. KU-60019 is 10-fold more effective than KU-55933 at blocking radiation-induced phosphorylation of key ATM targets in human glioma cells. As expected, KU-60019 is a highly effective radiosensitizer of human glioma cells. A-T fibroblasts were not radiosensitized by KU-60019, strongly suggesting that the ATM kinase is specifically targeted. Furthermore, KU-60019 reduced basal S473 AKT phosphorylation, suggesting that the ATM kinase might regulate a protein phosphatase acting on AKT. In line with this finding, the effect of KU-60019 on AKT phosphorylation was countered by low levels of okadaic acid, a phosphatase inhibitor, and A-T cells were impaired in S473 AKT phosphorylation in response to radiation and insulin and unresponsive to KU-60019. We also show that KU-60019 inhibits glioma cell migration and invasion in vitro, suggesting that glioma growth and motility might be controlled by ATM via AKT. Inhibitors of MEK and AKT did not further radiosensitize cells treated with KU-60019, supporting the idea that KU-60019 interferes with prosurvival signaling separate from its radiosensitizing properties. Altogether, KU-60019 inhibits the DNA damage response, reduces AKT phosphorylation and prosurvival signaling, inhibits migration and invasion, and effectively radiosensitizes human glioma cells.",

The imbalance between human neutrophil elastase and endogenous antiproteases may cause excess human neutrophil elastase in pulmonary tissues, which may be considered a major pathogenic factor in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Great effort has been devoted to finding a method to restore the balance, resulting in the discovery of potent two-typed small-molecular-weight human neutrophil elastase inhibitors. In the application of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease therapy, the human neutrophil elastase inhibitors mainly focused upon include ONO-5046, MR-889, L-694,458, CE-1037, GW-311616 and TEI-8362 as the acyl-enzyme inhibitors; and ONO-6818, AE-3763, FK-706, ICI-200,880, ZD-0892 and ZD-8321 as the transition-state inhibitors.

        "abstract": "Here, we describe the enzymatic synthesis of novel inhibitors using acarviosine-glucose as a donor and 3-alpha-D-glucopyranosylpropen (alphaGP) as an acceptor. Maltogenic amylase from Thermus sp. (ThMA) catalyzed the transglycosylation of the acarviosine moiety to alphaGP. The two major reaction products were isolated using chromatographies. Structural analyses revealed that acarviosine was transferred to either C-7 or C-9 of the alphaGP, which correspond to C-4 and C-6 of glucose. Both inhibited rat intestine alpha-glucosidase competitively but displayed a mixed-type inhibition mode against human pancreatic alpha-amylase. The alpha-acarviosinyl-(1--&gt;7)-3-alpha-D-glucopyranosylpropen showed weaker inhibition potency than acarbose against both alpha-glycosidases. In contrast, the alpha-acarviosinyl-(1--&gt;9)-3-alpha-D-glucopyranosylpropen exhibited a 3.0-fold improved inhibition potency against rat intestine alpha-glucosidase with 0.3-fold inhibition potency against human pancreatic alpha-amylase relative to acarbose. In conclusion, alpha-acarviosinyl-(1--&gt;9)-3-alpha-D-glucopyranosylpropen is a novel alpha-glucosidase-selective inhibitor with 10-fold enhanced selectivity toward alpha-glucosidase over alpha-amylase relative to acarbose, and it could be applied as a potent hypoglycemic agent.",

Despite the inhibitory effect of GSK1838705A on insulin receptor, minimal effects on glucose homeostasis were observed at efficacious doses. GSK1838705A also inhibits the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK), which drives the aberrant growth of anaplastic large-cell lymphomas, some neuroblastomas, and a subset of non-small cell lung cancers. GSK1838705A inhibits ALK, with an IC(50) of 0.5 nmol/L, and causes complete regression of ALK-dependent tumors in vivo at well-tolerated doses.

        "abstract": "Based on recent reports that several (E)-8-styrylcaffeinyl analogues are potent reversible inhibitors of monoamine oxidase B (MAO-B), a series of 8-benzyloxycaffeinyl analogues were synthesized and evaluated as inhibitors of baboon liver MAO-B and recombinant human MAO-A and -B. The 8-benzyloxycaffeinyl analogues were found to inhibit reversibly both MAO isoforms with enzyme-inhibitor dissociation constants (K(i) values) ranging from 0.14 to 1.30 microM for the inhibition of human MAO-A, and 0.023-0.59 microM for the inhibition of human MAO-B. The most potent MAO-A inhibitor was 8-(3-methylbenzyloxy)caffeine while 8-(3-bromobenzyloxy)caffeine was the most potent MAO-B inhibitor. The analogues inhibited human and baboon MAO-B with similar potencies. A quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) study indicated that the MAO-B inhibition potencies of the 8-benzyloxycaffeinyl analogues are dependent on the Hansch lipophilicity (pi) and Hammett electronic (sigma) constants of the substituents at C-3 of the benzyloxy ring. Electron-withdrawing substituents with a high degree of lipophilicity enhance inhibition potency.

This key role in cell cycle progression, as well as their deregulation in several human cancers, makes them attractive therapeutic targets in oncology. A series of CDK inhibitors was developed using Astex's fragment-based medicinal chemistry approach, linked to high-throughput X-ray crystallography. A compound from this series, designated AT7519, is currently in early-phase clinical development. We describe here the biological characterization of AT7519, a potent inhibitor of several CDK family members. AT7519 showed potent antiproliferative activity (40-940 nmol/L) in a panel of human tumor cell lines, and the mechanism of action was shown here to be consistent with the inhibition of CDK1 and CDK2 in solid tumor cell lines. AT7519 caused cell cycle arrest followed by apoptosis in human tumor cells and inhibited tumor growth in human tumor xenograft models. Tumor regression was observed following twice daily dosing of AT7519 in the HCT116 and HT29 colon cancer xenograft models. We show that these biological effects are linked to inhibition of CDKs in vivo and that AT7519 induces tumor cell apoptosis in these xenograft models. AT7519 has an attractive biological profile for development as a clinical candidate, and the tolerability and efficacy in animal models compare favorably with other CDK inhibitors in clinical development. Studies described here formed the biological rationale for investigating the potential therapeutic benefit of AT7519 in cancer patients.",

However, several (S)-2-carboalkoxy-substituted-3alpha-[bis(4-fluorophenyl)methoxy]tropane analogues were discovered to stimulate locomotor activity and substitute in subjects trained to discriminate cocaine, suggesting a role of the 2-position substituent in mediating these cocaine-like actions. Herein, we describe the synthesis of a series of novel N- and 2-substituted-3alpha-[bis(4-fluoro- or 4-chlorophenyl)methoxy]tropane analogues. Most of these analogues demonstrated high affinity binding to the dopamine transporter (DAT; K(i) = 1.8-40 nM), and selectivity over the other monoamine transporters and muscarinic M(1) receptors. When the (S)-2-carboalkoxy substituent was replaced with (S)-2-ethenyl, the resulting analogue 11 demonstrated the highest DAT binding affinity in the series (K(i) = 1.81 nM) with DAT selectivity over serotonin transporters (SERT; 989-fold), norepinephrine transporters (NET; 261-fold) and muscarinic receptors (90-fold). When the 4'-F groups of compounds 5 (K(i) = 2.94 nM) and 8 (K(i) = 6.87 nM) were replaced with 4'-Cl in the (S)-2-carboalkoxy series, DAT binding affinities were slightly reduced (K(i) = 12.6 and 14.6 nM for 6 and 7, respectively), yet inhibition of dopamine uptake potency remained comparably high (IC(50) range = 1.5-2.5 nM). Interestingly, the 4'-Cl analogue (+/-)-6 substituted less in rats trained to discriminate cocaine than the 4'-F analogue (+/-)-5. These studies demonstrate that manipulation of the 2-, N-, and 3-position substituents in the 3alpha-(diphenylmethoxy)tropane class of dopamine uptake inhibitors can result in ligands with high affinity and selectivity for the DAT, and distinctive in vivo pharmacological profiles that cannot be predicted by their effects in vitro.",

Thirty-eight young healthy male subjects (aged 20-45 years) received an oral dose of 5, 12.5, 25 or 50 mg BAY 60-5521 (n= 28) or were treated with a placebo (n= 10). RESULTS: In all four dose steps, only one adverse event (25 mg; mild skin rash) was considered drug related. Clinical laboratory parameters showed no clinically relevant changes. A clear dose-dependent CETP inhibition could be demonstrated starting at a dose of 5 mg. At a dose of 25 mg, a CETP inhibition &gt;50% over 18 h was observed. After 50 mg, CETP inhibition &gt;50% lasted more than 50 h. Twenty-four h after administration mean HDL-C-values showed a nearly dose-proportional increase. Following administration of 50 mg, a significant HDL-C increase of about 30% relative to baseline values was found. BAY 60-5521 was slowly absorbed reaching maximum concentrations in plasma after 4 to 6 h. The disposition in plasma was multi-exponential with an estimated mean terminal half-life of 76 to 144 h. CONCLUSIONS: BAY 60-5521 was clinically safe and well tolerated. No effects on heart rate, blood pressure and ECG recordings were observed during the study. A clear pharmacodynamic effect on CETP inhibition and HDL could be demonstrated.",

Effects of sphingosine and lysophingolipids were studied on the activity of purified cytidylyltransferase prepared by the method of Weinhold et al. (Weinhold, P. A., Rounsifer, M.E., and Feldman, D.A. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 5104-5110). The sphingolipids were tested as components of egg phosphatidylcholine (PC) vesicles, 25 mol% sphingosine inhibited the CT activity by about 50%. The inhibition of CT by sphingosine and lysosphingolipids was reversible. Sphingosine was found to be a reversible inhibitor of CT with respect to the activating lipids such as phosphatidylserine, phosphatidylinositol, phosphatidylglycerol, and fatty acid:phosphatidylcholine vesicles. Egg PC vesicles containing sphingosine, psychosine (galactosylsphingosine), glucopsychosine (glucosylsphingosine), and lysosphingomyelin (sphingosylphosphorylcholine) suppressed the activation by PC/oleic acid vesicles, whereas the parent sphingolipids did not. Egg PC vesicles containing oleylamine and hexadecyltrimethylamine inhibited CT activity, whereas egg PC-octylamine vesicles did not alter the enzyme activity. This indicates the importance of an amino group and long alkyl chain. LysoPC, a known detergent, did not inhibit the enzyme activity under the same assay conditions in which sphingosine inhibited. These results are the first report of a lipid inhibitor of purified CT.",

The methanolic fraction of Acanthus ilicifolius leaf extract produced significant inhibition of rat paw oedema, when administered both prior to and after carrageenan administration, in a manner similar to BW755C a synthetic cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase (LOX) inhibitor. The extract decreased protein exudation and leukocyte migration in the peritoneal fluid, thereby indicating its effectiveness towards inhibiting peritoneal inflammation. It also produced significant inhibition of COX (1 and 2) and 5-LOX activity. Preincubation of the extract inhibited the production of proinflammatory cytokines (TNFalpha and IL-6) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The methanolic fraction of the extract was also found to possess significant free radical (DPPH, ABTS, superoxide and hydroxyl radical) scavenging activity.

Selective BRAF and MAP-ERK kinase (MEK) inhibitors have shown clinical efficacy in patients with melanoma. However, the majority of responses are transient, and resistance is often associated with pathway reactivation of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) signaling pathway. Here, we describe the identification and characterization of SCH772984, a novel and selective inhibitor of ERK1/2 that displays behaviors of both type I and type II kinase inhibitors. SCH772984 has nanomolar cellular potency in tumor cells with mutations in BRAF, NRAS, or KRAS and induces tumor regressions in xenograft models at tolerated doses. Importantly, SCH772984 effectively inhibited MAPK signaling and cell proliferation in BRAF or MEK inhibitor-resistant models as well as in tumor cells resistant to concurrent treatment with BRAF and MEK inhibitors.

        "abstract": "The receptor tyrosine kinase c-Met is an attractive target for therapeutic blockade in cancer. Here, we describe MK-2461, a novel ATP-competitive multitargeted inhibitor of activated c-Met. MK-2461 inhibited in vitro phosphorylation of a peptide substrate recognized by wild-type or oncogenic c-Met kinases (N1100Y, Y1230C, Y1230H, Y1235D, and M1250T) with IC(50) values of 0.4 to 2.5 nmol/L. In contrast, MK-2461 was several hundredfold less potent as an inhibitor of c-Met autophosphorylation at the kinase activation loop. In tumor cells, MK-2461 effectively suppressed constitutive or ligand-induced phosphorylation of the juxtamembrane domain and COOH-terminal docking site of c-Met, and its downstream signaling to the phosphoinositide 3-kinase-AKT and Ras-extracellular signal-regulated kinase pathways, without inhibiting autophosphorylation of the c-Met activation loop. BIAcore studies indicated 6-fold tighter binding to c-Met when it was phosphorylated, suggesting that MK-2461 binds preferentially to activated c-Met. MK-2461 displayed significant inhibitory activities against fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR), platelet-derived growth factor receptor, and other receptor tyrosine kinases. In cell culture, MK-2461 inhibited hepatocyte growth factor/c-Met-dependent mitogenesis, migration, cell scatter, and tubulogenesis. Seven of 10 MK-2461-sensitive tumor cell lines identified from a large panel harbored genomic amplification of MET or FGFR2. In a murine xenograft model of c-Met-dependent gastric cancer, a well-tolerated oral regimen of MK-2461 administered at 100 mg/kg twice daily effectively suppressed c-Met signaling and tumor growth. Similarly, MK-2461 inhibited the growth of tumors formed by s.c. injection of mouse NIH-3T3 cells expressing oncogenic c-Met mutants. Taken together, our findings support further preclinical development of MK-2461 for cancer therapy.",

Leucettines were cocrystallized with DYRK1A, DYRK2, CLK3, PIM1, and GSK-3beta. The selectivity of L41 was studied by activity and interaction assays of recombinant kinases and affinity chromatography and competition affinity assays. These approaches revealed unexpected potential secondary targets such as CK2, SLK, and the lipid kinase PIKfyve/Vac14/Fig4. L41 displayed neuroprotective effects on glutamate-induced HT22 cell death. L41 also reduced amyloid precursor protein-induced cell death in cultured rat brain slices. The unusual multitarget selectivity of leucettines may account for their neuroprotective effects.

        "abstract": "Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is a cancer with its highest prevalence among the southern Chinese and is rare elsewhere in the world. The main treatment modalities include chemotherapy and radiotherapy. However, tumor chemoresistance often limits the efficacy of nasopharyngeal carcinoma treatment and reduces survival rates. Thus, identifying new selective chemotherapeutic drugs for nasopharyngeal carcinoma treatment is needed. In this current study, the antitumor efficacy of a polo-like kinase inhibitor, Ro5203280, was investigated. Ro5203280 induces tumor suppression both in vitro and in vivo. An inhibitory effect was observed with the highly proliferating cancer cell lines tested, but not with the nontumorigenic cell line. Real-time cell proliferation and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis, together with immunohistochemical (IHC), immunofluorescence, and Annexin V staining assays, were used to evaluate the impact of drug treatment on cell cycle and apoptosis. Ro5203280 induces G2-M cell-cycle arrest and apoptosis. Western blotting shows it inhibits PLK1 phosphorylation and downregulates the downstream signaling molecule, Cdc25c, and upregulates two important mitosis regulators, Wee1 and Securin, as well as the DNA damage-related factor Chk2 in vitro and in vivo. In vivo tumorigenicity assays with Ro5203280 intravenous injection showed its potent ability to inhibit tumor growth in mice, with no observable signs of toxicity. These findings suggest the potential usefulness of Ro5203280 as a chemotherapeutic targeting drug for nasopharyngeal carcinoma treatment.",

METHODS: To calculate properly the kinetics and the duration of AChE inhibition, the effects of MSF were also studied in rodents. These experiments suggested that MSF administered three times per week should provide safe and efficacious AChE inhibition. In a randomized placebo-controlled phase I study, 3.6 mg, 7.2 mg or 10.8 mg MSF were then orally administered to 27 consenting healthy volunteers (aged 50 to 72 years). After a single dose phase and a 1 week wash-out period, the subjects received the same doses three times per week for 2 weeks. RESULTS: Twenty-two out of the 27 subjects completed the study. Four patients withdrew due to adverse events (AEs) and one for non-compliance. Erythrocyte AChE was inhibited by a total of 33%, 46%, and 62% after 2 weeks of 3.6 mg, 7.2 mg and 10.8 mg MSF, respectively. No serious AEs occurred. The most frequent AEs were headache (27%), nausea (11%) and diarrhoea (8%). CONCLUSIONS: MSF proved to be well tolerated even with repeated oral dosing.

        "abstract": "Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) is a phospholipid that binds to a set of G protein-coupled receptors (S1P(1)-S1P(5)) to initiate an array of signaling cascades that affect cell survival, differentiation, proliferation, and migration. On a larger physiological scale, the effects of S1P on immune cell trafficking, vascular barrier integrity, angiogenesis, and heart rate have also been observed. An impetus for the characterization of S1P-initiated signaling effects came with the discovery that FTY720 [fingolimod; 2-amino-2-(2-[4-octylphenyl]ethyl)-1,3-propanediol] modulates the immune system by acting as an agonist at S1P(1). In the course of structure-activity relationship studies to better understand the functional chemical space around FTY720, we discovered conformationally constrained FTY720 analogs that behave as S1P receptor type-selective antagonists. Here, we present a pharmacological profile of a lead S1P(1/3) antagonist prodrug, 1-(hydroxymethyl)-3-(3-octylphenyl)cyclobutane (VPC03090). VPC03090 is phosphorylated by sphingosine kinase 2 to form the competitive antagonist species 3-(3-octylphenyl)-1-(phosphonooxymethyl)cyclobutane (VPC03090-P) as observed in guanosine 5'-O-(3-[(35)S]thio)triphosphate binding assays, with effects on downstream S1P receptor signaling confirmed by Western blot and calcium mobilization assays. Oral dosing of VPC03090 results in an approximate 1:1 phosphorylated/alcohol species ratio with a half-life of 30 h in mice. Because aberrant S1P signaling has been implicated in carcinogenesis, we applied VPC03090 in an immunocompetent mouse mammary cancer model to assess its antineoplastic potential. Treatment with VPC03090 significantly inhibited the growth of 4T1 primary tumors in mice. This result calls to attention the value of S1P receptor antagonists as not only research tools but also potential therapeutic agents.",

        "abstract": "Impaired mitochondrial function, oxidative stress and formation of excessive levels of reactive oxygen species play a key role in neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease. Myeloperoxidase is a reactive oxygen generating enzyme and is expressed by microglia. The novel compound AZD3241 is a selective and irreversible inhibitor of myeloperoxidase. The hypothesized mechanism of action of AZD3241 involves reduction of oxidative stress leading to reduction of sustained neuroinflammation. The purpose of this phase 2a randomized placebo controlled multicentre positron emission tomography study was to examine the effect of 8 weeks treatment with AZD3241 on microglia in patients with Parkinson's disease. Parkinson patients received either AZD3241 600 mg orally twice a day or placebo (in 3:1 ratio) for 8 weeks. The binding of (11)C-PBR28 to the microglia marker 18 kDa translocator protein, was examined using positron emission tomography at baseline, 4 weeks and 8 weeks. The outcome measure was the total distribution volume, estimated with the invasive Logan graphical analysis. The primary statistical analysis examined changes in total distribution volume after treatment with AZD3241 compared to baseline. Assessments of safety and tolerability of AZD3241 included records of adverse events, vital signs, electrocardiogram, and laboratory tests. The patients had a mean age of 62 (standard deviation = 6) years; 21 were male, three female and mean Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale III score (motor examination) ranged between 6 and 29. In the AD3241 treatment group (n = 18) the total distribution volume of (11)C-PBR28 binding to translocator protein was significantly reduced compared to baseline both at 4 and 8 weeks (P < 0.05). The distribution volume reduction across nigrostriatal regions at 8 weeks ranged from 13-16%, with an effect size equal to 0.5-0.6. There was no overall change in total distribution volume in the placebo group (n = 6). AZD3241 was safe and well tolerated. The reduction of (11)C-PBR28 binding to translocator protein in the brain of patients with Parkinson's disease after treatment with AZD3241 supports the hypothesis that inhibition of myeloperoxidase has an effect on microglia. The results of the present study provide support for proof of mechanism of AZD3241 and warrant extended studies on the efficacy of AZD3241 in neurodegenerative disorders.",

        "abstract": "Recent reports have illustrated a reciprocal relationship between circadian rhythm disruption and mood disorders. The 5-HT7 receptor may provide a crucial link between the two sides of this equation since the receptor plays a critical role in sleep, depression, and circadian rhythm regulation. To further define the role of the 5-HT7 receptor as a potential pharmacotherapy to correct circadian rhythm disruptions, the current study utilized the selective 5-HT7 antagonist JNJ-18038683 (10 mg/kg) in three different circadian paradigms. While JNJ-18038683 was ineffective at phase shifting the onset of wheel running activity in mice when administered at different circadian time (CT) points across the circadian cycle, pretreatment with JNJ-18038683 blocked non-photic phase advance (CT6) induced by the 5-HT1A/7 receptor agonist 8-OH-DPAT (3 mg/kg). Since light induced phase shifts in mammals are partially mediated via the modulation of the serotonergic system, we determined if JNJ-18038683 altered phase shifts induced by a light pulse at times known to phase delay (CT15) or advance (CT22) wheel running activity in free running mice. Light exposure resulted in a robust shift in the onset of activity in vehicle treated animals at both times tested. Administration of JNJ-18038683 significantly attenuated the light induced phase delay and completely blocked the phase advance. The current study demonstrates that pharmacological blockade of the 5-HT7 receptor by JNJ-18038683 blunts both non-photic and photic phase shifts of circadian wheel running activity in mice. These findings highlight the importance of the 5-HT7 receptor in modulating circadian rhythms. Due to the opposite modulating effects of light resetting between diurnal and nocturnal species, pharmacotherapy targeting the 5-HT7 receptor in conjunction with bright light therapy may prove therapeutically beneficial by correcting the desynchronization of internal rhythms observed in depressed individuals.",

        "abstract": "Dyslipidemia is a major risk factor for cardiovascular (CV) disease - the primary cause of death, worldwide. Although reducing levels of low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol can significantly reduce CV risk, a high level of residual risk persists, especially in people with obesity-related conditions, such as metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes mellitus. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha- (PPARalpha-) agonists (e.g. fibrates), play a central role in the reduction of macro- and microvascular risk in these patients. However, the currently available fibrates are weak (PPARalpha-agonists) with limited efficacy due to dose-related adverse effects. To address this problem, a new generation of highly potent and selective PPARalpha-modulators (SPPARMalpha) is being developed that separate the benefits of the PPARalpha-agonists from their unwanted side effects. Among these, aleglitazar (a dual PPARalpha/gamma agonist) and GFT505 (a dual PPAR alpha/delta agonist) have recently entered late-phase development. Although both compounds are more potent PPARalpha-activators than fenofibrate in vitro, only aleglitezar is more effective in lowering triglycerides and raising high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C) in humans. However, it is also associated with a potential risk of adverse effects. More recently, a highly potent, specific PPARalpha-agonist (K-877) has emerged with SPPARMalpha characteristics. Compared to fenofibrate, K-877 has more potent PPARalpha-activating efficacy in vitro, greater effects on triglycerides- and HDL-C levels in humans, and a reduced risk of adverse effects. If successful, K-877 has the potential to supersede the fibrates as the treatment of choice for patients with residual CV risk associated with metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes.",

In the studies reported here, we investigated the effect of AA-2379 on rat polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN) functions to clarify the mechanism of the antiinflammatory and antiallergic actions of AA-2379. AA-2379 at 10(-4) M inhibited lysozomal enzyme release. AA-2379 inhibits formyl methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP)- and C5a-induced arachidonic acid release; their 50% inhibitory concentrations were 2.8 x 10(-5) and 3.8 x 10(-5) M, respectively. Because dibutyryl cAMP, a cAMP analogue, and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, a cAMP phosphodiesterase inhibitor, inhibited fMLP-induced arachidonic acid release, and AA-2379 inhibited cAMP phosphodiesterase and increased cAMP content in PMNs, it is likely that AA-2379 inhibited arachidonic acid release by increasing cAMP content in rat PMNs. Furthermore, from the studies of fMLP-induced arachidonic acid release in Ca free medium it is suggested that AA-2379 inhibits the process which depends on Ca concentration in the medium. These results suggest that the inhibitory effect of AA-2379 on inflammation and allergic reactions such as the Arthus reaction is partly exerted by inhibiting PMN functions such as arachidonic acid and lysozomal enzyme release.",

        "abstract": "DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) catalyzes DNA methylation and is overexpressed in various human diseases, including cancer. A rational approach to preventing tumorigenesis involves the use of pharmacologic inhibitors of DNA methylation; these inhibitors should reactivate tumor suppressor genes (TSGs) in tumor cells and restore tumor suppressor pathways. Antroquinonol D (3-demethoxyl antroquinonol), a new DNMT1 inhibitor, was isolated from Antrodia camphorata and identified using nuclear magnetic resonance. Antroquinonol D inhibited the growth of MCF7, T47D, and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells without harming normal MCF10A and IMR-90 cells. The SRB assay showed that the 50% growth inhibition (GI50) in MCF7, T47D, and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells following treatment with antroquinonol D was 8.01, 3.57, and 25.08 muM, respectively. d-Antroquinonol also inhibited the migratory ability of MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells in wound healing and Transwell assays. In addition, antroquinonol D inhibited DNMT1 activity, as assessed by the DNMT1 methyltransferase activity assay. As the cofactor SAM level increased, the inhibitory effects of d-antroquinonol on DNMT1 gradually decreased. An enzyme activity assay and molecular modeling revealed that antroquinonol D is bound to the catalytic domain of DNMT1 and competes for the same binding pocket in the DNMT1 enzyme as the cofactor SAM, but does not compete for the binding pocket in the DNMT3B enzyme. An Illumina Methylation 450 K array-based assay and real-time PCR assay revealed that antroquinonol D decreased the methylation status and reactivated the expression of multiple TSGs in MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells. In conclusion, we showed that antroquinonol D induces DNA demethylation and the recovery of multiple tumor suppressor genes, while inhibiting breast cancer growth and migration potential.",

        "abstract": "In brain and other tissues, nitric oxide (NO) operates as a diffusible second messenger that stimulates the soluble form of the guanylyl cylase enzyme and so elicits an accumulation of cGMP in target cells. Inhibitors of NO synthesis have been used to implicate NO in a wide spectrum of physiological and pathophysiological mechanisms in the nervous system and elsewhere. The function of cGMP in most tissues, however, has remained obscure. We have now identified a compound, 1H-[1,2,4]oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ), that potently and selectively inhibits NO-stimulated guanylyl cyclase activity. In incubated slices of cerebellum, ODQ reversibly inhibited the NO-dependent cGMP response to glutamate receptor agonists (IC50 approximately nM) but did not affect NO synthase activity. The compound did not affect synaptic glutamate receptor function, as assessed in hippocampal slices, nor did it chemically inactivate NO. ODQ did, however, potentially inhibit cGMP generation in response to NO-donating compounds. An action on NO-stimulated soluble guanylyl cyclase was confirmed in studies with the purified enzyme. ODQ failed to inhibit NO-mediated macrophage toxicity, a phenomenon that is unrelated to cGMP, nor did it affect the activity of particulate guanylyl cyclase or adenylyl cyclase. ODQ is the first inhibitor that acts selectively at the level of a physiological NO \"receptor\" and, as such, it is likely to prove useful for investigating the function of the cGMP pathway in NO signal transduction.",

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Three cohorts were studied: cohort A, a sequential dose escalation of OPB-51602 administered intermittently (days 1-14 every 21 days); cohort B, an expansion cohort evaluating the dose lower than the MTD; cohort C, evaluating continuous daily dosing. RESULTS: Fifty-one patients were studied at 2, 4, and 5 mg per day dosing. The MTD was 5 mg; first-cycle dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were grade 3 hyponatremia in one patient, and grade 3 dehydration in another. Intermittent dosing of both 2 and 4 mg doses were tolerable, and the recommended phase II dose was 4 mg. Cohort B investigated 4 mg intermittently, whereas cohort C investigated 4 mg continuously. Common toxicities included fatigue, nausea/vomiting, diarrhea, anorexia, and early-onset peripheral neuropathy. Drug-induced pneumonitis occurred in two patients in cohort C. Continuous dosing was associated with a higher incidence of peripheral neuropathy and a lower mean relative dose intensity, compared with intermittent dosing. Steady-state pharmacokinetics was characterized by high oral clearance, mean elimination half-life ranging from 44 to 61 h, and a large terminal-phase volume of distribution. An active metabolite, OPB-51822, accumulated to a greater extent than OPB-51602. Flow cytometry of peripheral blood mononuclear cells demonstrated pSTAT3 (Tyr(705)) inhibition following exposure. Two patients achieved partial responses at 5 mg intermittently and 4 mg continuously; both had epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation-positive non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with prior EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor exposure. CONCLUSION: OPB-51602 demonstrates promising antitumor activity, particularly in NSCLC. Its long half-life and poorer tolerability of continuous dosing, compared with intermittent dosing, suggest that less frequent dosing should be explored. CLINICALTRIALSGOV IDENTIFIER: NCT01184807.",

        "abstract": "Agents that inhibit estrogen production, such as aromatase inhibitors or those that directly block estrogen receptor (ER) activity, such as selective estrogen receptor modulators and selective estrogen receptor degraders, are routinely used in the treatment of ER-positive breast cancers. However, although initial treatment with these agents is often successful, many women eventually relapse with drug-resistant breast cancers. To overcome some of the challenges associated with current endocrine therapies and to combat the development of resistance, there is a need for more durable and more effective ER-targeted therapies. Here we describe and characterize a novel, orally bioavailable small-molecule selective estrogen receptor degrader, RAD1901, and evaluate its therapeutic potential for the treatment of breast cancer. RAD1901 selectively binds to and degrades the ER and is a potent antagonist of ER-positive breast cancer cell proliferation. Importantly, RAD1901 produced a robust and profound inhibition of tumor growth in MCF-7 xenograft models. In an intracranial MCF-7 model, RAD1901-treated animals survived longer than those treated with either control or fulvestrant, suggesting the potential benefit of RAD1901 in the treatment of ER-positive breast cancer that has metastasized to the brain. Finally, RAD1901 preserved ovariectomy-induced bone loss and prevented the uterotropic effects of E2, suggesting that it may act selectively as an agonist in bone but as an antagonist in breast and uterine tissues. RAD1901 is currently under clinical study in postmenopausal women with ER-positive advanced breast cancer.",

        "abstract": "The selection of a therapeutically meaningful dose of a novel pharmaceutical is a crucial step in drug development. Positron emission tomography (PET) allows the in vivo estimation of the relationship between the plasma concentration of a drug and its target occupancy, optimizing dose selection and reducing the time and cost of early development. Triple reuptake inhibitors (TRIs), also referred to as serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitors, enhance monoaminergic neurotransmission by blocking the action of the monoamine transporters, raising extracellular concentrations of those neurotransmitters. GSK1360707 [(1R,6S)-1-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-6-(methoxymethyl)-4-azabicyclo[4.1.0]heptane] is a novel TRI that until recently was under development for the treatment of major depressive disorder; its development was put on hold for strategic reasons. We present the results of an in vivo assessment of the relationship between plasma exposure and transporter blockade (occupancy). Studies were performed in baboons (Papio anubis) to determine the relationship between plasma concentration and occupancy of brain serotonin reuptake transporter (SERT), dopamine reuptake transporter (DAT), and norepinephrine uptake transporter (NET) using the radioligands [(11)C]DASB [(N,N-dimethyl-2-(2-amino-4-cyanophenylthio) benzylamine], [(11)C]PE2I [N-(3-iodoprop-2E-enyl)-2beta-carbomethoxy-3beta-(4-methylphenyl)nortropane], and [(11)C]2-[(2-methoxyphenoxy)phenylmethyl]morpholine (also known as [(11)C]MRB) and in humans using [(11)C]DASB and [(11)C]PE2I. In P. anubis, plasma concentrations resulting in half-maximal occupancy at SERT, DAT, and NET were 15.16, 15.56, and 0.97 ng/ml, respectively. In humans, the corresponding values for SERT and DAT were 6.80 and 18.00 ng/ml.

        "abstract": "Light responses of retinal ON bipolar cells are mediated by metabotropic glutamate receptors selectively activated by L-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid (L-AP4). Antagonists to L-AP4 receptors in ON bipolar cells have not previously been identified. This study examines the electrophysiological effects of (S)-2-amino-2-methyl-4-phosphonobutanoic acid (MAP4), (RS)-4-4-chloro-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (CDHPG) and (RS)-3,4,5-trihydroxyphenylglycine (THPG), at L-AP4 receptors in ON bipolar cells of the amphibian retina. Unlike its actions in spinal cord, in retinal ON bipolar cells MAP4 is a weak agonist which exhibits no detectable antagonism to L-AP4. On the other hand, CDHPG exhibits a mixture of agonist and antagonist properties. Addition of Co2+ and oxygenation of CDHPG turns the solution brown and enhances antagonist effects, suggesting that the antagonism reflects actions of a breakdown product of CDHPG. Although THPG did not prove to be this breakdown product, it also has electrophysiological effects consistent with an L-AP4 receptor antagonist. The results suggest that THPG and breakdown products of CDHPG may be antagonists to L-AP4 receptors in retinal ON bipolar cells, although the possibility that these compounds antagonize effects of L-AP4 by acting at some site in the transduction pathway of L-AP4 receptors cannot yet be excluded.",

A variety of tryptamine derivatives were tested and showed a significantly higher affinity when the 5-HT6 receptor was labelled with [3H]-5-HT, whereas ergoline compounds and several antagonists had higher affinities when [3H]-LSD was used as radioligand. Subsequently we examined the ability of LSD, 5-HT and a number of tryptamine derivatives to stimulate cAMP accumulation in order to determine their agonist potency and efficacy.

        "abstract": "RS 57639, by being a partial agonist in rat esophagus but a competitive antagonist in guinea-pig ileum, is one of several ligands which operationally discriminate among 5-HT4 receptors in different tissues. The discovery of splice variants of the 5-HT4 receptor, 5-HT4S and 5-HT4L, raises the possibility that this functional heterogeneity among 5-HT4 receptors may be due to differences in the interaction of ligands with different isoforms of the receptor. To test this idea, the functional and binding interactions of RS 57639 with rat 5-HT4S and 5-HT4L receptors were characterized. RS 57639 stimulated adenylate cyclase in cells expressing 5-HT4S or 5-HT4L receptors with similar potency (pEC50 = 7.9 +/- 0.1 and 7.6 +/- 0.1) and efficacy (71 +/- 3 and 59 +/- 4% of 5-HT). [3H]RS 57639 also bound to 5-HT4S and 5-HT4L receptors with similar affinity (Kd = 0.09 +/- 0.01 and 0.11 +/- 0.01 nM) and specificity (SB204070 &gt; GR113808 &gt; SDZ 205557 &gt; cisapride &gt; renzapride &gt; alpha me-5-HT &gt; 5-CT). Therefore, the operational differences among 5-HT4 receptors, detected with RS 57639, are not explained by differences in the interaction of the ligand with 5-HT4S and 5-HT4L receptors. [3H]RS 57639 binding to guinea-pig striatal membranes was also characterized. [3H]RS 57639 bound with high affinity (Kd = 0.25 +/- 0.07 nM) and a specificity similar to that of the 5-HT4 receptor antagonist, [3H]GR113808. Therefore, while the mechanism by which RS 57639 operationally distinguishes among 5-HT4 receptors was not determined, [3H]RS 57639 was shown to specifically label native and cloned 5-HT4 receptors. As the first selective agonist radioligand to be described for this receptor, [3H]RS 57639 may prove useful in further studies of receptor coupling and ligand interactions.",

        "abstract": "AIM: To determine efficacy and tolerability of dutogliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitor, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. METHODS: This was a 12-week, multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 423 patients with type 2 diabetes with suboptimal metabolic control. Following a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in, patients aged 18-75 years with a body mass index of 25-48 kg/m(2) and baseline HbA1c of 7.3-11.0% were randomized 2:2:1 to receive once-daily oral therapy with either dutogliptin (400 or 200 mg) or placebo on a background medication of either metformin alone, a thiazolidinedione (TZD) alone or a combination of metformin plus a TZD. RESULTS: Average HbA1c at baseline was 8.4%. Administration of dutogliptin 400 and 200 mg for 12 weeks decreased HbA1c by -0.52% (p &lt; 0.001) and -0.35% (p = 0.006), respectively (placebo-corrected values), with absolute changes in HbA1c for the 400 mg, 200 mg and placebo groups of -0.82, -0.64 and -0.3%, respectively. The proportion of patients achieving an HbA1c &lt; 7% was 27, 21 and 12% at dutogliptin doses of 400 and 200 mg or placebo, respectively (p = 0.008 for comparison of 400 mg vs. placebo). Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) levels were significantly reduced in both active treatment groups compared to placebo: the placebo-corrected difference was -1.00 mmol/l (p &lt; 0.001) for the 400 mg group and -0.88 mmol/l (p = 0.003) for the 200 mg group. Dutogliptin caused significantly greater reductions in postprandial glucose AUC (0-2h) in both the 400 and 200 mg groups (placebo corrected values -2.58 mmol/l/h, p &lt; 0.001 and -1.63 mmol/l/h, p = 0.032, respectively). In general, patients tolerated the study drug well. There were minor, not clinically meaningful differences in adverse events (AEs) between dutogliptin-treated patients and placebo controls, and 60% of all reported AEs were mild. Vital signs and body weight were stable, and routine safety laboratory parameters did not change compared with placebo. Trough ex vivo DPP4 inhibition at the end of the 12-week treatment period was 80 and 70%, at the 400 and 200 mg doses of dutogliptin, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Dutogliptin treatment for 12 weeks improved glycaemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes who were on a background medication of metformin, a TZD or metformin plus a TZD. Tolerability was favourable for both doses tested. The 400 mg dose of dutogliptin resulted in larger changes of HbA1c and FPG and more subjects reached an HbA1c target of &lt; 7% than the 200 mg dose.",

Here we demonstrate that in human tumor cells the geranylgeranyltransferase-I (GGTase-I) inhibitor GGTI-298 blocked cells in G0/G1, whereas the farnesyltransferase (FTase) inhibitor FTI-277 showed a differential effect depending on the cell line. FTI-277 accumulated Calu-1 and A-549 lung carcinoma and Colo 357 pancreatic carcinoma cells in G2/M, T-24 bladder carcinoma, and HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cells in G0/G1, but had no effect on cell cycle distribution of pancreatic (Panc-1), breast (SKBr 3 and MDAMB-231), and head and neck (A-253) carcinoma cells. Furthermore, treatment of Calu-1, Panc-1, Colo 357, T-24, A-253, SKBr 3, and MDAMB-231 cells with GGTI-298, but not FTI-277, induced the protein expression levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p21WAF. HT-1080 and A-549 cells had a high basal level of p21WAF, and GGTI-298 did not further increase these levels. Furthermore, GGTI-298 also induces the accumulation of large amounts of p21WAF mRNA in Calu-1 cells, a cell line that lacks the tumor suppressor gene p53. There was little effect of GGTI-298 on the cellular levels of another cyclin- dependent kinase inhibitor p27KIP as well as cyclin E and cyclin D1. These results demonstrate that GGTase-I inhibitors arrest cells in G0/G1 and induce accumulation of p21WAF in a p53-independent manner and that FTase inhibitors can interfere with cell cycle events by a mechanism that involves neither p21WAF nor p27KIP.

We have studied the interaction of aprophen and benactyzine, both aromatic esters of diethylaminoethanol, with nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (AChR) in BC3H-1 intact muscle cells and with receptor-enriched membranes of Torpedo californica. Aprophen and benactyzine diminish the maximal carbamylcholine-elicited sodium influx into muscle cells without shifting Kact (carbamylcholine concentration eliciting 50% of the maximal 22Na+ influx). The concentration dependence for the inhibition of the initial rate of 22Na+ influx by aprophen and benactyzine occurs at lower concentrations (Kant = 3 and 50 microM, respectively) than those needed to inhibit the initial rate of [125I]-alpha-bungarotoxin binding to the agonist/antagonist sites of the AChR (Kp = 83 and 800 microM, respectively). The effective concentration for atropine inhibition of AChR response (Kant = 150 microM in BC3H-1 cells) is significantly higher than those obtained for aprophen and benactyzine. Both aprophen and benactyzine interact with the AChR in its desensitized state in BC3H-1 cells without further enhancing agonist affinity. Furthermore, these ligands do not alter the value of Kdes (equilibrium concentration of agonist which diminishes 50% of the maximal receptor response) in BC3H-1 muscle cells. The affinity of aprophen and benactyzine for the allosterically coupled noncompetitive inhibitor site of the AChR in Torpedo was determined using [3H]phencyclidine as a probe. Both compounds were found to preferentially associate with the high affinity (desensitized) state rather than the resting state of Torpedo AChR. There is a 14- to 23-fold increase in the affinity of aprophen and benactyzine for the AChR (KD = 0.7 and 28.0 microM in the desensitized state compared to 16.4 and 384 microM in the resting state, respectively). These data indicate that aprophen and benactyzine binding are allosterically regulated by the agonist sites of Torpedo AChR. Thus, aprophen and benactyzine are effective noncompetitive inhibitors of the AChR at concentrations of 1-50 microM, in either Torpedo or mammalian AChR. These concentrations correspond very well with the blood level of these drugs found in vivo to produce a therapeutic response against organophosphate poisoning.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The melanocortin receptor-5 (MC5R) is present in human sebaceous glands, where it is expressed in differentiated sebocytes only. The targeted disruption of MC5R in mice resulted in reduced sebaceous lipid production and a severe defect in water repulsion. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the physiological function of MC5R in human sebaceous glands. METHODS: A novel MC1R and MC5R antagonist (JNJ-10229570) was used to treat primary human sebaceous cells or human skins grafted onto severe combined immunodeficient (SCID) mice. Transcription profiling, lipid analyses, and histological and immunohistochemical staining were used to analyze the effect of MC5R inhibition on sebaceous gland differentiation and sebum production. RESULTS: JNJ-10229570 dose dependently inhibited the production of sebaceous lipids in cultured primary human sebocytes. Topical treatment with JNJ-10229570 of human skins transplanted onto SCID mice resulted in a marked decrease in sebum-specific lipid production, sebaceous gland's size and the expression of the sebaceous differentiation marker epithelial-membrane antigen (EMA). Treatment with flutamide, a known inhibitor of sebum production, gave similar results, validating the human skin/SCID mouse experimental system for sebaceous secretion studies. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that antagonists of MC1R and MC5R could be effective sebum suppressive agents and might have a potential for the treatment of acne and other sebaceous gland pathologies.",

        "abstract": "Increased fatty acid oxidation contributes to hyperglycemia in patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. To improve glucose homeostasis in these patients, we have designed a novel, reversible inhibitor of carnitine palmitoyl-transferase I (CPT I) that potently inhibits fatty acid oxidation. SDZ-CPI-975 significantly lowered glucose levels in normal 18-h-fasted nonhuman primates and rats. In rats, glucose lowering required fatty acid oxidation inhibition of &gt; or = 70%, as measured by beta-hydroxybutyrate levels, the end product of beta-oxidation. In cynomolgus monkeys, comparable glucose lowering was achieved with more modest lowering of beta-hydroxybutyrate levels. SDZ-CPI-975 did not increase glucose utilization by heart muscle, suggesting that CPT I inhibition with SDZ-CPI-975 would not induce cardiac hypertrophy. This was in contrast to the irreversible CPT I inhibitor etomoxir. These results demonstrate that SDZ-CPI-975 effectively inhibited fatty acid oxidation and lowered blood glucose levels in two species. Thus reversible inhibitors of CPT I represent a class of novel hypoglycemic agents that inhibit fatty acid oxidation without inducing cardiac hypertrophy.",

Sections of histologically normal human kidney obtained from patients undergoing nephrectomy for hypernephroma (50-74 years, N = 10, male or female) were incubated with 0.1 nM [125I]-ET-1, [125I]-Tyr13 big ET-1 or [125I]-Tyr31 big ET-1 in culture media at 37 degrees to facilitate enzymatic activity. Specific binding measured from sections incubated with [125I]-Try13 big ET-1 (which would yield [125I]-ET-1 on enzymatic cleavage) was 39.7 +/- 2.5%. This was significantly reduced to 19.0 +/- 2.0% following co-incubation with 10 microM thiorphan, an inhibitor of neutral endopeptidase (NEP) but not the putative endothelin converting enzymes (ECE). No further reduction in specific binding was obtained with 100 microM thiorphan, indicating that this is a maximal effect. However phosphoramidon (100 microM), an inhibitor of ECE and NEP, almost abolished specific binding, indicating that both NEP and ECE cleave big ET-1 in the kidney. No specific binding was detected when sections were labelled with [125I]-Tyr31 big ET-1 (which would be expected to yield [125I] labelled C-terminal fragment). Binding of the product of processed [125I]-Tyr13 big ET-1 was inhibited mainly by the ET(B) selective antagonist (BQ788 = 75.1 +/- 2.1% inhibition; FR139317 = 9.7 +/- 7.3% inhibition), consistent with the predominance of this subtype in human kidney. We conclude that big ET-1 is processed by NEP and ECE in human kidney and that the cleaved product binds predominantly to the ET(B) receptor subtype. ECE may be a therapeutic target in the attenuation of renal diseases in which ET-1 has been implicated.",

        "abstract": "The intraerythrocytic human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, requires a source of hypoxanthine for nucleic acid synthesis and energy metabolism. Adenosine has been implicated as a major source for intraerythrocytic hypoxanthine production via deamination and phosphorolysis, utilizing adenosine deaminase and purine nucleoside phosphorylase, respectively. To study the expression and characteristics of human malaria purine nucleoside phosphorylase, P. falciparum was successfully cultured in purine nucleoside phosphorylase-deficient human erythrocytes to an 8% parasitemia level. Purine nucleoside phosphorylase activity was undetectable in the uninfected enzyme-deficient host red cells but after parasite infection rose to 1.5% of normal erythrocyte levels. The parasite purine nucleoside phosphorylase was not cross-reactive with antibody against human enzyme, exhibited a calculated native molecular weight of 147,000, and showed a single major electrophoretic form of pI 5.4 and substrate specificity for inosine, guanosine and deoxyguanosine but not xanthosine or adenosine. The Km values for substrates, inosine and guanosine, were 4-fold lower than that for the human erythrocyte enzyme. In these studies we have identified two novel potent inhibitors of both human erythrocyte and parasite purine nucleoside phosphorylase, 8-amino-5'-deoxy-5'-chloroguanosine and 8-amino-9-benzylguanine. These enzyme inhibitors may have some antimalarial potential by limiting hypoxanthine production in the parasite-infected erythrocyte.",

Several phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated isoprenes were analyzed as inhibitors of the enzymes using a standard spectrophotometric assay. Of the three proteins, only MKase was inhibited through competitive interaction at the ATP-binding site.

It has recently been postulated that NSAIDs' antiinflammatory efficacy arises from inhibition of the COX-2 isoform of cyclooxygenase, whereas inhibition of the COX-1 isoform produces the troublesome and sometimes serious gastric and renal side effects of NSAIDs. A relatively selective COX-2 inhibitor, such as meloxicam, may combine antiinflammatory efficacy with improved tolerability. In volunteers, indomethacin 75 mg, but not meloxicam 7.5 mg, inhibited renal prostaglandin E2 excretion and platelet aggregation (COX-1 mediated effects). Double-blind, randomized trials in osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis patients have shown equivalent antiinflammatory efficacy among meloxicam 7.5 mg or 15 mg and diclofenac 100 mg, naproxen 750 mg, and piroxicam 20 mg. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, meloxicam (7.5 or 15 mg) caused less endoscopically detected gastrointestinal (GI) damage (Lanza scale) than piroxicam 20 mg. The MELISSA study, a double-blind, randomized, 28-day trial in over 9,000 patients showed that meloxicam 7.5 mg caused statistically less total GI toxicity, dyspepsia, abdominal pain, nausea and vomiting, and diarrhea than diclofenac 100 mg, despite equivalent reductions in pain on movement for each treatment. A global safety analysis of clinical trials, representing over 5,600 patients and comprising 170 and 1,100 patient-years of exposure for meloxicam 7.5 mg and 15 mg, respectively, showed that meloxicam caused less GI toxicity and fewer peptic ulcers and GI bleeds than naproxen, diclofenac, or piroxicam. The renal safety profile and incidence of liver function abnormalities with meloxicam is equivalent to other NSAIDs available for clinical use. In conclusion, relatively selective COX-2 inhibition exemplified by meloxicam may offer effective symptom relief with an improved GI tolerability profile.",

DL-TBOA inhibited the uptake of [14C]glutamate in COS-1 cells expressing the human excitatory amino acid transporter-1 (EAAT1) (Ki = 42 microM) with almost the same potency as DL-threo-beta-hydroxyaspartate (Ki = 58 microM). With regard to the human excitatory amino acid transporter-2 (EAAT2), the inhibitory effect of DL-TBOA (Ki = 5.7 microM) was much more potent than that of dihydrokainate (Ki = 79 microM), which is well known as a selective blocker of this subtype. Electrophysiologically, DL-TBOA induced no detectable inward currents in Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing human EAAT1 or EAAT2. However, it significantly reduced the glutamate-induced currents, indicating the prevention of transport. The dose-response curve of glutamate was shifted by adding DL-TBOA without a significant change in the maximum current. The Kb values for human EAAT1 and EAAT2 expressed in X. laevis oocytes were 9.0 microM and 116 nM, respectively. These results demonstrated that DL-TBOA is, so far, the most potent competitive blocker of glutamate transporters. DL-TBOA did not show any significant effects on either the ionotropic or metabotropic glutamate receptors. Moreover, DL-TBOA is chemically much more stable than its benzoyl analog, a previously reported blocker of excitatory amino acid transporters; therefore, DL-TBOA should be a useful tool for investigating the physiological roles of transporters.",

This activity resided in its (+)-eutomer, (+)-S 14297 (13/297 nM) as compared with its (-)-distomer, (-)-S 17777 (406/3544 nM). In contrast, (+)-AJ 76 manifested only a mild 2-fold preference for D3 sites (70/154 nM), whereas haloperidol and six additional antagonists showed a mild (2-7-fold) preference for D2 sites. As concerns agonists, (+)-7-OH-DPAT, (+/-)-CGS 15855A, quinelorane, (-)-quinpirole and N-0434 displayed a preference (6-40-fold) for D3 receptors, whereas piribedil showed a slight, 2-fold, preference for D2 sites (243/126 nM). (+)-S 14297 showed low (&gt; 1.0 microM) affinity at rat D1 and D2 sites and at cloned, human D4 and D5 receptors and only low affinity (145 to &gt; 10,000 nM) at all other sites examined. In vivo, administered s.c., (+)-7-OH-DPAT, CGS 15855A, quinelorane, (-)-quinpirole and N-0434 potently evoked hypothermia. Across all (8) agonists tested, potency correlated significantly with affinity at D3 sites (r = .84, P &lt; .001) but not D2 sites (r = .50, P &gt; .05). (+)-S 14297 (0.16-1.25 mg/kg, s.c.) blocked the induction of hypothermia by (+)-7-OH-DPAT, CGS 15855A and (-)-quinpirole, but not by the alpha 2-adrenergic agonist, clonidine, without influencing core temperature alone. In contrast, (-)-S 17777 (10.0 mg/kg, s.c.) was only partially active. Across all (9) antagonists, potency for inhibition of (+)-7-OH-DPAT-induced hypothermia correlated more strongly with affinity at D3 (r = .96, P &lt; .001) than D2 (r = .75, P &lt; .02) sites. Whereas haloperidol and the other antagonists provoked prolactin secretion and elicited catalepsy, (+)-S 14297 and (+/-)-S 11566 at doses of up to 10.0 and 40.0 mg/kg, s.c., respectively, were not significantly effective (P &gt; .05). Across all antagonists, potency for eliciting prolactin secretion and catalepsy correlated better with affinity at D2 (r = .95 and .96) than D3 (r = .76 and .91) sites.

        "abstract": "In previous reports, [3H]5-HT has been used to characterize the pharmacology of the rat and human 5-HT2B receptors. 5-HT, the native agonist for the 5-HT2B receptor, has a limitation in its usefulness as a radioligand since it is difficult to study the agonist low-affinity state of a G protein-coupled receptor using an agonist radioligand. When using [3H]5-HT as a radioligand, rauwolscine was determined to have relatively high affinity for the human receptor (Ki human = 14.3+/-1.2 nM, compared to Ki rat = 35.8+/-3.8 nM). Since no known high affinity antagonist was available as a radioligand, these studies were performed to characterize [3H]rauwolscine as a radioligand for the cloned human 5-HT2B receptor expressed in AV12 cells. When [3H]rauwolscine was initially tested for its usefulness as a radioligand, complex competition curves were obtained. After testing several alpha2-adrenergic ligands, it was determined that there was a component of [3H]rauwolscine binding in the AV12 cell that was due to the presence of an endogenous alpha2-adrenergic receptor. The alpha2-adrenergic ligand efaroxan was found to block [3H]rauwolscine binding to the alpha2-adrenergic receptor without significantly affecting binding to the 5-HT2B receptor and was therefore included in all subsequent studies. In saturation studies at 37 degrees C, [3H]rauwolscine labeled a single population of binding sites, Kd = 3.75+/-0.23 nM. In simultaneous experiments using identical tissue samples, [3H]rauwolscine labeled 783+/-10 fmol of 5-HT2B receptors/mg of protein, as compared to 733+/-14 fmol of 5-HT2B receptors/mg of protein for [3H]5-HT binding. At 0 degrees C, where the conditions for [3H]5-HT binding should label mostly the agonist high affinity state of the human 5-HT2B receptor, [3H]rauwolscine (Bmax = 951+/-136 fmol/mg), again labeled significantly more receptors than [3H]5-HT (Bmax = 615+/-34 fmol/mg). The affinity of [3H]rauwolscine for the human 5-HT2B receptor at 0 degrees C did not change, Kd = 4.93+/-1.27 nM, while that for [3H]5-HT increased greatly (Kd at 37 degrees C = 7.76+/-1.06 nM; Kd at 0 degrees C = 0.0735+/-0.0081 nM). When using [3H]rauwolscine as the radioligand, competition curves for antagonist structures modeled to a single binding site, while agonist competition typically resulted in curves that best fit a two site binding model. In addition, many of the compounds with antagonist structures displayed higher affinity for the 5-HT2B receptor when [3H]rauwolscine was the radioligand. Typically, approximately 85% of [3H]rauwolscine binding was specific binding. These studies display the usefulness of [3H]rauwolscine as an antagonist radioligand for the cloned human 5-HT2B receptor. This should provide a good tool for the study of both the agonist high- and low-affinity states of the human cloned 5-HT2B receptor.",

A tetrahydrochrysene (THC) has a 4-fold preferential binding affinity for ER beta; it is an agonist on ER alpha, but a complete antagonist on ER beta.

The S,S-enantiomer (S,S-THC) is an agonist on both ER alpha and ER beta but has a 20-fold lower affinity for ER beta than R,R-THC. This difference in binding affinity accounts for the full ER beta antagonist activity of the THC racemate (a 1:1 mixture of R,R-THC and S,S-THC).

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Cerebral ischemia causes an increased expression and activation of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) and matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9). Recent works demonstrated that the selective 5-LOX inhibitor zileuton down-regulates MMP-9 expression in vascular diseases and cancer. In the present work, we first studied the neuroprotective effect of zileuton on focal cerebral ischemia in rats and further investigated the effect of zileuton on the expression of 5-LOX and MMP-9 in ischemic brain. METHODS: Adult Sprague-Dawley rats underwent permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO). The rats then received treatment with zileuton 5, 10 or 50 mg/kg or vehicle. Cerebral water content and infarct volume were measured 24 hours after pMCAO. Expression of 5-LOX messenger RNA (mRNA) and MMP-9 mRNA were determined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The levels of the proform and the active form of MMP-9 were detected by gelatin zymography. RESULTS: Oral treatment of zileuton at 10 or 50 mg/kg significantly reduced cerebral water content and infarct volume. It also down-regulated the expression of 5-LOX mRNA and MMP-9 mRNA. Zileuton at 50 mg/kg could inhibit the active form of MMP-9. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that selective 5-LOX inhibitor zileuton attenuates ischemic brain damage in rats, which may be partly associated with MMP-9 inhibition.",

In view of the current interest in antithyroid drugs, we have recently carried out biomimetic studies to understand the mechanism by which the antithyroid drugs inhibit the thyroid hormone synthesis and found that the replacement of sulfur with selenium in MMI leads to an interesting compound that may reversibly block the thyroid hormone synthesis.

        "abstract": "Idoxifene, a novel selective estrogen receptor modulator, was tested for its effects on bone loss, serum cholesterol, and uterine wet weight and histology in the ovariectomized (Ovx) rat. Idoxifene (0.5 mg/kg x day) completely prevented loss of both lumbar and proximal tibial bone mineral density (BMD). In an intervention study, idoxifene (0.5 and 2.5 mg/kg x day) completely prevented further loss of both lumbar and proximal tibial BMD during a 2-month treatment period commencing 1 month after surgery, when significant loss of BMD had occurred in the Ovx control group. Idoxifene reduced total serum cholesterol, which was maximal at 0.5 mg/kg x day. Idoxifene alone displayed minimal uterotrophic activity in Ovx rats and inhibited the agonist activity of estrogen in intact rats. Histologically, myometrial and endometrial atrophy were observed in both idoxifene and vehicle-treated Ovx rats. In this report, we also provide molecular-based evidence to support the observations in vivo of a novel selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) mechanism of action in bone and endometrial cells. Idoxifene is an agonist through the estrogen response element (ERE) and exhibits similar postreceptor effects to estrogen in bone-forming osteoblasts. Idoxifene also stimulates osteoclast apoptosis, and these pleiotropic effects ultimately could contribute to the maintenance of bone homeostasis. However, idoxifene differs from estrogen in a tissue-specific manner. In human endometrial cells, where estrogen is a potent agonist through the ERE, idoxifene has negligible agonist activity. Moreover, idoxifene was able to block estrogen induced gene expression in endometrial cells, which is in agreement with the observation in the intact rat study. In the uterus, idoxifene has a pharmacologically favorable profile, lacking agonist and therefore growth-promoting activity. Together with its cholesterol lowering effect and lack of uterotrophic activity, these data suggest that idoxifene may be effective in the prevention of osteoporosis and other postmenopausal diseases without producing unwanted estrogenic effects on the endometrium.",

This study prompted the present hypothesis that, at elevated concentrations of substrates, oxypurinol would be superior to allopurinol as an inhibitor of the xanthine oxidase-catalyzed production of superoxide radical. It was found that the potency of allopurinol was attenuated by elevated concentrations of xanthine and hypoxanthine, whereas the potency of oxypurinol was relatively unaffected. Oxypurinol produced immediate inhibition of superoxide radical production as well as progressive inhibition with time. In contrast, allopurinol, which is also a substrate for xanthine oxidase, produced very little immediate inhibition and caused progressive inhibition only after conversion to oxypurinol.

        "abstract": "The current study was conducted to examine the involvement of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors of the amygdala in morphine-induced state-dependent memory retrieval. Male Wistar rats implanted bilaterally with cannulas in the amygdala were submitted to a step-through type passive avoidance task, and tested 24 h after training to measure step-through latency. Post-training s.c. administration of morphine at the doses of 5 and 7.5 mg/kg impaired the memory on the test day, which was restored when the same doses of morphine were used as a pre-test drug. This phenomenon is well known as morphine-induced state-dependent memory retrieval. Bilateral microinjection of the non-selective muscarinic acetylcholine receptor agonist, pilocarpine (0.25 and 0.5 microg/side), into the amygdala with an ineffective dose of morphine (0.5 mg/kg s.c.) significantly improved the memory retrieval and mimicked the effects of pre-test administration of a higher dose of morphine. It should be noted that in the animals that received saline after training and tested following intra-amygdala administration of pilocarpine (0.125, 0.25 and 0.5 microg/side) and those which received post-training morphine (7.5 mg/kg s.c.) and pre-test intra-amygdala microinjection of the same doses of pilocarpine, no significant change was observed in the step-through latencies. On the other hand, pre-test intra-amygdala microinjection of a selective muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist scopolamine (0.125 and 0.25 microg/side) inhibited morphine-induced state-dependent memory retrieval. In addition, no significant changes were seen in memory retrieval of the animals trained before saline treatment and tested following intra-amygdala microinjection of the same doses of scopolamine (0.0625, 0.125 and 0.25 microg/side). Bilateral microinjection of scopolamine into the amygdala reversed the pilocarpine-induced potentiation of the morphine response.

Proliferation of lymphocytes is critically dependent on this de novo nucleotide synthesis pathway. Hence, IMPDH is an attractive target for the development of immunosuppressive drugs. VX-148 is a novel, uncompetitive IMPDH inhibitor with a K(i) value of 6 nM against IMPDH type II enzyme. VX-148 is slightly more potent than mycophenolic acid and VX-497 in inhibiting the proliferation of mitogen-stimulated primary human lymphocytes (IC(50) value of ~80 nM). The inhibitory activity of VX-148 is alleviated in the presence of exogenous guanosine. VX-148 does not inhibit proliferation of nonlymphoid cell types such as fibroblasts, indicating selectivity for inhibition of IMPDH activity. VX-148 is orally bioavailable in rats and mice; oral administration of VX-148 inhibits primary antibody response in mice in a dose-dependent manner with an ED(50) value of 38 mg/kg b.i.d. VX-148 significantly prolongs skin graft survival at 100 mg/kg b.i.d. in mice.

        "abstract": "It has been proposed that 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO)-activating protein (FLAP) is an arachidonate transfer protein for leukotriene biosynthesis. Using the Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) insect cells, we demonstrate that FLAP causes a large stimulation (190-fold) of the conversion of 12(S)-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (12(S)-HETE) to 5, 12-diHETE when co-expressed with 5-lipoxygenase. We also demonstrate that FLAP can stimulate (2-2.5-fold) the oxygenation of 15(S)-HETE by 5-LO to 5,15-diHETE. The stimulation of both 12(S)-HETE and 15(S)-HETE oxygenation by 5-LO is completely inhibitable by the FLAP inhibitor, MK-886. In order to determine which residues of FLAP are important for 12(S)-HETE and arachidonic acid utilization by 5-LO, various mutants of FLAP were co-expressed with 5-LO in Sf9 cells. The FLAP deletion mutants del 37-53, del 52-58, del 106-108, and del 148-161 and the point mutant D62N were analyzed. The D62N mutation, which reduces the binding of indole inhibitors to FLAP, had no effect on the stimulation of substrate utilization by 5-LO. In contrast to wild type FLAP, the mutant proteins del 37-53, del 106-108, and del 148-161 failed to stimulate 12(S)-HETE and arachidonic acid utilization by 5-LO. Only one of the latter three mutations (del 37-53) has been shown to abolish the binding of indole inhibitors to FLAP. These results suggest that the lipid binding site of FLAP overlaps the inhibitor binding site and occupies several regions of the protein not essential for inhibitor binding. Because FLAP can stimulate the utilization of 12(S)-HETE, 15(S)-HETE, and arachidonic acid by 5-LO, FLAP may also function as a more general lipid carrier protein for the biosynthesis of multiple oxygenation products of arachidonic acid in addition to its role in leukotriene biosynthesis.",

Particularly H3-receptor agonists have been suggested to become valuable drugs for the treatment of several CNS disorders, inflammatory and acid related diseases. Due to its strong basicity and polarity the highly potent and selective histamine H3-receptor agonist (R)-alpha-methylhistamine hardly penetrates biological membranes and is furthermore rapidly inactivated in vivo. Thus, lipophilic, non-basic azomethine prodrugs of (R)-alpha--methylhistamine have been developed to overcome its pharmacokinetic disadvantages. This bioreversible derivatization decreased its basicity, increased its lipophilicity and reduced its metabolization. As a result the biological half-life was prolonged and oral absorption as well as penetration into the brain were significantly increased. By systematic variation of the pro-moiety we were able to optimize the pharmacokinetic properties which allow for both peripheral and central delivery of the parent amine. The azomethine prodrugs described herein display satisfactory stability to be orally administered while being adequately labile to deliver (R)-alpha-methylhistamine at sufficient concentrations in vivo. At present, these azomethines not only serve as valuable tools for pharmacological studies related to the histamine H3 receptor, but also represent a promising approach to achieve therapeutic application of the histamine H3-receptor agonist (R)-alpha-methylhistamine.

ADX10059 250 mg tds reduced pH-metry-measured oesophageal acid exposure, throughout the 24 h period, nocturnally and postprandially, and significantly reduced the number and duration of symptomatic reflux episodes (p = 0.03). ADX10059 50 mg tds was not significantly superior to placebo. ADX10059 was generally well tolerated. CONCLUSION: The mGluR5 negative allosteric modulator ADX10059 reduced acid reflux which was associated with improvement in clinical symptoms in patients with GORD. ADX10059 appears to have a potential role in the clinical management of GORD.",

We assessed in vitro effects of NVP-AUY922 on proliferation and protein expression in NSCLC cell lines. We evaluated gene expression changes induced by NVP-AUY922 exposure. Xenograft models were evaluated for tumor control and biological effects. NVP-AUY922 potently inhibited in vitro growth in all 41 NSCLC cell lines evaluated with IC50 &lt; 100 nmol/L. IC100 (complete inhibition of proliferation) &lt; 40 nmol/L was seen in 36 of 41 lines. Consistent gene expression changes after NVP-AUY922 exposure involved a wide range of cellular functions, including consistently decreased dihydrofolate reductase after exposure. NVP-AUY922 slowed growth of A549 (KRAS-mutant) xenografts and achieved tumor stability and decreased EGF receptor (EGFR) protein expression in H1975 xenografts, a model harboring a sensitizing and a resistance mutation for EGFR-tyrosine kinase inhibitors in the EGFR gene.

As a key regulator of multiple steps during mitotic progression across eukaryotic species, the serine/threonine-specific Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) is highly expressed in malignant cells and serves as a negative prognostic marker in specific human cancer types . Here, we report the discovery of a potent small-molecule inhibitor of mammalian Plk1, BI 2536, which inhibits Plk1 enzyme activity at low nanomolar concentrations. The compound potently causes a mitotic arrest and induces apoptosis in human cancer cell lines of diverse tissue origin and oncogenome signature. BI 2536 inhibits growth of human tumor xenografts in nude mice and induces regression of large tumors with well-tolerated intravenous dose regimens. In treated tumors, cells arrest in prometaphase, accumulate phosphohistone H3, and contain aberrant mitotic spindles. This mitotic arrest is followed by a surge in apoptosis, detectable by immunohistochemistry and noninvasive optical and magnetic resonance imaging. For addressing the therapeutic potential of Plk1 inhibition, BI 2536 has progressed into clinical studies in patients with locally advanced or metastatic cancers.",

        "abstract": "Hyperglycemia resulting from type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is the main cause of diabetic complications such as retinopathy and neuropathy. A reduction in hyperglycemia has been shown to prevent these associated complications supporting the importance of glucose control. Glucokinase converts glucose to glucose-6-phosphate and determines glucose flux into the beta-cells and hepatocytes. Since activation of glucokinase in beta-cells is associated with increased risk of hypoglycemia, we hypothesized that selectively activating hepatic glucokinase would reduce fasting and postprandial glucose with minimal risk of hypoglycemia. Previous studies have shown that hepatic glucokinase overexpression is able to restore glucose homeostasis in diabetic models; however, these overexpression experiments have also revealed that excessive increases in hepatic glucokinase activity may also cause hepatosteatosis. Herein we sought to evaluate whether liver specific pharmacological activation of hepatic glucokinase is an effective strategy to reduce hyperglycemia without causing adverse hepatic lipids changes. To test this hypothesis, we evaluated a hepatoselective glucokinase activator, PF-04991532, in Goto-Kakizaki rats. In these studies, PF-04991532 reduced plasma glucose concentrations independent of changes in insulin concentrations in a dose-dependent manner both acutely and after 28 days of sub-chronic treatment. During a hyperglycemic clamp in Goto-Kakizaki rats, the glucose infusion rate was increased approximately 5-fold with PF-04991532. This increase in glucose infusion can be partially attributed to the 60% reduction in endogenous glucose production. While PF-04991532 induced dose-dependent increases in plasma triglyceride concentrations it had no effect on hepatic triglyceride concentrations in Goto-Kakizaki rats. Interestingly, PF-04991532 decreased intracellular AMP concentrations and increased hepatic futile cycling. These data suggest that hepatoselective glucokinase activation may offer glycemic control without inducing hepatic steatosis supporting the evaluation of tissue specific activators in clinical trials.",

        "abstract": "Induction of protein kinase C (PKC) pathway in the vascular tissues by hyperglycemia has been associated with many of the cellular changes observed in the complications of diabetes. Recently, we have reported that the use of a novel, orally effective specific inhibitor of PKC beta isoform (LY333531) normalized many of the early retinal and renal hemodynamics in rat models of diabetes. In the present study, we have characterized a spectrum of biochemical and molecular abnormalities associated with chronic changes induced by glucose or diabetes in the cultured mesangial cells and renal glomeruli that can be prevented by LY333531. Hyperglycemia increased diacylglycerol (DAG) level in cultured mesangial cells exposed to high concentrations of glucose and activated PKC alpha and beta1 isoforms in the renal glomeruli of diabetic rats. The addition of PKC beta selective inhibitor (LY333531) to cultured mesangial cells inhibited activated PKC activities by high glucose without lowering DAG levels and LY333531 given orally in diabetic rats specifically inhibited the activation of PKC beta1 isoform without decreasing PKC alpha isoform activation. Glucose-induced increases in arachidonic acid release, prostaglandin E2 production, and inhibition of Na+-K+ ATPase activities in the cultured mesangial cells were completely prevented by the addition of LY333531. Oral feeding of LY333531 prevented the increased mRNA expression of TGF-beta1 and extracellular matrix components such as fibronectin and alpha1(IV) collagen in the glomeruli of diabetic rats in parallel with inhibition of glomerular PKC activity. These results suggest that the activation of PKC, predominately the beta isoform by hyperglycemia in the mesangial cells and glomeruli can partly contribute to early renal dysfunctions by alteration of prostaglandin production and Na+-K+ ATPase activity as well as the chronic pathological changes by the overexpression of TGF-beta1 and extracellular matrix components genes.",

Fondaparinux sodium (pentasaccharide), the first in a new class of antithrombotic agents developed for the prevention and treatment of VTE, inhibits thrombin generation by selectively inhibiting factor Xa. Fondaparinux exhibits complete bioavailability by the subcutaneous route and is rapidly absorbed, reaching its maximum concentration approximately 2 h post dosing. It has a terminal half-life of 13 to 21 h, permitting once-daily dosing. Fondaparinux's reproducible linear pharmacokinetic profile exhibits minimal intrasubject and intersubject variability, suggesting that individual dose adjustments will not be required for the vast majority of the population and that there will be no need for routine hemostatic monitoring. At therapeutic concentrations (&lt;2 mg/L), fondaparinux exhibits &gt;94% binding to its target protein, antithrombin. Within this same concentration range there is no specific binding by fondaparinux to plasma proteins commonly involved in drug binding, indicating a low potential for drug-drug interactions by protein displacement. Unlike antithrombotic agents prepared from animal extracts (heparins), fondaparinux is chemically synthesized; this leads to batch-to-batch consistency and the absence of potential risk of contamination problems. In recently completed phase III clinical trials in VTE prevention in major orthopedic surgery, fondaparinux showed significant superiority over the low-molecular-weight heparin enoxaparin, providing an overall &gt;50% (P &lt; 0.001) reduction in VTE risk without increasing clinically important bleeding.

METHODS: Ten beagle dogs were used and divided into two groups with and without candoxatril, a neutral endopeptidase inhibitor preadministration. Before and after the 6 hours rapid atrial pacing from the right atrial appendage, the hemodynamics, atrial effective refractory period, and monophasic action potential duration of the right atrial appendage were measured and blood samples were collected. Atrial tissue was also excised after the experiment. RESULTS: Candoxatril significantly increased plasma ANP levels (Control: 88.4 +/- 50.25 vs. Candoxatril: 197.1 +/- 32.09 pg/ml, p = 0.004) and prevented reductions in atrial effective refractory period and monophasic action potential duration. We further demonstrated that the treated animals exhibited significantly higher levels of atrial tissue cyclic GMP (Control: 28.1 +/- 1.60 fmol/mg vs. Candoxatril: 44.5 +/- 12.28 fmol/mg, p = 0.034) as well as that of plasma cyclic GMP (Control: 32 +/- 5.5 vs. Candoxatril: 42 +/- 7.1 pg/ml, p = 0.028). CONCLUSION: Candoxatril suppressed the shortening of atrial effective refractory period and monophasic action potential duration in the rapid atrial pacing model. As plasma ANP and the atrial tissue levels of cyclic GMP were higher in the Candoxatril group than the control, this effect was considered to appear through the reduction of calcium overload caused by ANP and cyclic GMP.",

        "title": "Stabilization of Torpedo californica acetylcholinesterase by reversible inhibitors.",
        "abstract": "The dimeric form of Torpedo californica acetylcholinesterase provides a valuable experimental system for studying transitions between native, partially unfolded, and unfolded states since long-lived partially unfolded states can be generated by chemical modification of a nonconserved buried cysteine residue, Cys 231, by denaturing agents, by oxidative stress, and by thermal inactivation. Elucidation of the 3D structures of complexes of Torpedo californica acetylcholinesterase with a repertoire of reversible inhibitors permits their classification into three categories: (a) active-site directed inhibitors, which interact with the catalytic anionic subsite, at the bottom of the active-site gorge, such as edrophonium and tacrine; (b) peripheral anionic site inhibitors, which interact with a site at the entrance to the gorge, such as propidium and d-tubocurarine; and (c) elongated gorge-spanning inhibitors, which bridge the two sites, such as BW284c51 and decamethonium. The effects of these three categories of reversible inhibitors on the stability of Torpedo californica acetylcholinesterase were investigated using spectroscopic techniques and differential scanning calorimetry. Thermodynamic parameters obtained calorimetrically permitted quantitative comparison of the effects of the inhibitors on the enzyme's thermal stability. Peripheral site inhibitors had a relatively small effect, while gorge-spanning ligands and those binding at the catalytic anionic site, had a much larger stabilizing effect. The strongest effect was, however, observed with the polypeptide toxin, fasciculin II (FasII), even though, in terms of its binding site, it belongs to the category of peripheral site ligands. The stabilizing effect of the ligands binding at the anionic subsite of the active site, like that of the gorge-spanning ligands, may be ascribed to their capacity to stabilize the interaction between the two subdomains of the enzyme. The effect of fasciculin II may be ascribed to the large surface area of interaction (&gt;2000 A(2)) between the two proteins. Stabilization of Torpedo californica acetylcholinesterase by both divalent cations and chemical chaperones was earlier shown to be due to a shift in equilibrium between the native state and a partially unfolded state ( Millard et al. ( 2003 ) Protein Sci. 12 , 2337 - 2347 ). The low molecular weight inhibitors used in the present study may act similarly and can thus be considered as pharmacological chaperones for stabilizing the fully folded native form of the enzyme.",

ARF was induced by occlusion of the left renal artery and vein for 45 min followed by reperfusion, 2 weeks after contralateral nephrectomy. Renal function in ARF rats markedly decreased at 24 h after reperfusion. Intravenous bolus injection of SM-19712 (3, 10, 30 mg/kg) prior to the occlusion attenuated dose-dependently the ischemia/reperfusion-induced renal dysfunction. Histopathological examination of the kidney of ARF rats revealed severe renal damages such as tubular necrosis, proteinaceous casts in tubuli and medullary congestion, all of which were dose-dependently attenuated by SM-19712. Protective effects of phosphoramidon (10 mg/kg) on ARF-induced functional and tissue damages were less potent than that of the same dose of SM-19712. Endothelin-1 (ET-1) content in the kidney after the ischemia/reperfusion was significantly increased, being the maximum level at 6 h after reperfusion, and this elevation was completely suppressed by the higher dose of SM-19712.

Because of the likely use of anacetrapib with hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitors, we aimed to evaluate the potential for a pharmacokinetic interaction with simvastatin. METHODS: A randomized, two-period, two-treatment, balanced, open-label, crossover study in 12 healthy subjects was performed. Subjects received simvastatin 40 mg alone or anacetrapib 150 mg co-administered with simvastatin 40 mg, once daily. Both treatments were administered following a low-fat breakfast for 14 days, separated by a wash-out period of at least 14 days. Safety and tolerability, simvastatin and simvastatin acid concentrations, and lipoproteins, were assessed. RESULTS: Both treatments were well tolerated. The pharmacokinetics of simvastatin and simvastatin acid were similar with and without anacetrapib administration {AUC(0-24 h) geometric mean ratio [90% confidence interval (CI)] for simvastatin acid and simvastatin were 1.36 [1.17, 1.57] and 1.30 [1.14, 1.47], respectively} based on the prespecified comparability bounds of (0.50, 2.00). Treatment with simvastatin alone led to a mean (95% CI) % reduction from baseline in low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C) of -36% (-27, -46) compared with a reduction of -54% (-44, -63) for anacetrapib co-administered with simvastatin. CONCLUSIONS: There appears to be no clinically meaningful effect of anacetrapib on the pharmacokinetic parameters of simvastatin. When co-administered with simvastatin, anacetrapib appeared to exhibit incremental LDL-C-lowering efficacy, due to CETP inhibition. Co-administration of anacetrapib and simvastatin was well tolerated.",

Conditions that result in accumulation of astemizole, ebastine and terfenadine may prolong the QT interval and result in torsade de pointes. The remaining agents reviewed do not appear to have this risk. For allergic rhinitis, all agents are effective and the choice should be based on other factors. For urticaria, cetirizine and mizolastine demonstrate superior suppression of wheal and flare at the dosages recommended by the manufacturer. For atopic dermatitis, as adjunctive therapy to reduce pruritus, cetirizine, ketotifen and loratadine demonstrate efficacy. Although current evidence does not suggest a primary role for these agents in the management of asthma, it does support their use for asthmatic patients when there is coexisting allergic rhinitis, dermatitis or urticaria.",

        "abstract": "The mammalian peptide neuromedin B (NMB) and its receptor are expressed in a variety of tissues; however, little is definitively established about its physiological actions because of the lack of potent, specific antagonists. Recently, the peptoid PD 168368 was found to be a potent human NMB receptor antagonist. Because it had been shown previously that either synthetic analogs of bombesin (Bn) or other receptor peptoid or receptor antagonists function as an antagonist or agonist depends on animal species and receptor subtype studied, we investigated the pharmacological properties of PD 168368 compared with all currently known Bn receptor subtypes (NMB receptor, gastrin-releasing peptide receptor, Bn receptor subtype 3, and Bn receptor subtype 4) from human, mouse, rat, and frog. In binding studies, PD 168368 had similar high affinities (K(i) = 15-45 nM) for NMB receptors from each species examined, 30- to 60-fold lower affinity for gastrin-releasing peptide receptors, and &gt;300-fold lower affinity for Bn receptor subtype 3 or 4. It inhibited NMB binding in a competitive manner. PD 168368 alone did not stimulate increases in either intracellular calcium concentration or [(3)H]inositol phosphates in any of the cells studied but inhibited NMB-induced responses with equivalent potencies in cells containing NMB receptors. PD 168368 was only minimally soluble in water. When hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin rather than dimethyl sulfoxide was used as the vehicle, both the affinity and the antagonist potency of PD 168368 were significantly greater. The results demonstrate that PD 168368 is a potent, competitive, and selective antagonist at NMB receptors, with a similar pharmacology across animal species. PD 168368 should prove useful for delineating the biological role of NMB and selectively blocking NMB signaling in bioassays and as a lead for the development of more selective nonpeptide antagonists for the NMB receptor.",

In this study, the effect of ponalrestat on murine adenocarcinoma colon26-induced cachexia was investigated in mice. Mice bearing colon26 subcutaneously lost weight and became cachectic, associated with the tumor growth. Although tumor growth was slightly stimulated when tumor bearing mice were treated with ponalrestat: nevertheless, the drug attenuated the reduction in the weight of body mass, epididymal fat, gastrocnemius muscle and carcass induced by colon26, as well as significantly prolonged the survival of the colon26 bearing mice. Ponalrestat inhibited the production of interleukin-1 (IL-1) from human monocytes stimulated by Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in vitro, and also suppressed LPS-induced increase of IL-1 in the blood in mice. Overall, this study showed that ponalrestat suppresses IL-1 production both in vitro and in vivo, and inhibits the cachectic symptoms induced by colon26 adenocarcinoma in mice, suggesting that ponalrestat has a therapeutic potential for the treatment of cancer cachexia.",

Similarly, neither did a single, nor repeated (five times over 10 days), electroconvulsive shock, given under halothane anaesthesia, have any effect on [3H]raclopride binding parameters. By contrast, the noradrenaline and dopamine reuptake inhibitor, nomifensine (5 mg/kg), and the monoamine oxidase inhibitor, tranylcypromine (5 mg/kg), decreased the number of dopamine D2 receptors by 12% and 11%, respectively, when given for 14 days.

        "abstract": "Many modern models of receptor-G protein function assume that there is a direct relationship between high-affinity agonist binding and efficacy. The validity of this assumption has been recently questioned for the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor. We examined the intrinsic activities of various ligands in activating phosphoinositide hydrolysis and measured their respective binding affinities to the high- and low-affinity states of the 5-HT2C (VNV isoform) and 5-HT(2A) receptors. Ligand binding affinities for the high-affinity state of the receptors were determined using 1-(4-[125I]iodo-2,5-dimethoxyphenyl)2-aminopropane, whereas [3H]mesulergine and N-[3H]methylspiperone were used, in the presence of excess guanine nucleotide [guanosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate)], to define binding to the low-affinity state of the 5-HT2C and 5-HT2A receptors, respectively. Antagonists labeled the high- and low-affinity states of each receptor with comparable affinities. Previously identified inverse agonists of the 5-HT2C receptor behaved as silent antagonists in our systems even when the receptor was overexpressed at a relatively high density. In contrast, the ability of agonists to bind differentially to the high- and low-affinity states of the 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors was highly correlated (r2 = 0.86 and 0.96, respectively) with their intrinsic activities. These data suggest that high-affinity agonist states can account for agonist efficacy at human 5-HT2A or 5-HT2C receptors without the need for considering additional transition or active states of the receptor-ligand complex. The procedure described herein may expedite drug discovery efforts by predicting intrinsic activities of ligands solely from ligand binding assays.",

        "abstract": "To understand the ligand binding properties of the human GnRH receptor (hGnRH-R), 24 site-specific mutants within transmembrane helices (TMH) 1, 2, and 5 and the extracellular loop 2 (E2) were generated. These mutants were analyzed by using a functional reporter gene assay, monitoring receptor signaling via adenylate cyclase to a cAMP-responsive element fused to Photinus pyralis luciferase. The functional behavior of 14 receptor mutants, capable of G-protein coupling and signaling, was studied in detail with different well described agonistic and antagonistic peptide ligands. Furthermore, the binding constants were determined in displacement binding experiments with the antagonist [125I]Cetrorelix. The substitution of residues K36, Q204, W205, H207, Q208, F20, F213, F216, and S217 for alanine had no or only a marginal effect on ligand binding and signaling. In contrast, substitution of N87, Eg9, D9, R179, W206, Y211, F214, and T215 for alanine resulted in receptor proteins neither capable of ligand binding nor signal transduction. Within those mutants affecting ligand binding and signaling to various degrees, W101A, N102A, and N212Q differentiate between agonists and antagonists. Thus, in addition to N102 already described, the residues W101 in TMH2 and N212 in TMH5 are important for the architecture of the ligand-binding pocket. Based on the experimental data, three-dimensional models for binding of the superagonist D-Trp6-GnRH (Triptorelin) and the antagonist Cetrorelix to the hGnRH-R are proposed. Both decapeptidic ligands are bound to the receptor in a bent conformation with distinct interactions within the binding pocket formed by all TMHs, E2, and E3. The antagonist Cetrorelix with bulky hydrophobic N-terminal amino acids interacts with quite different receptor residues, a hint at the failure to induce an active, G protein-coupling receptor conformation.",

MEASUREMENTS: The thickness of the media of small pulmonary arteries and the ratio of the weight of the right ventricle free wall (RV) to that of the left ventricle with the septum (LV + S) were measured as indexes of the degree of PH. Serotonin concentrations in plasma and in supernatants of cultured vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) stimulated by IL-6 were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. The amplification of DNA encoding the 5-HT receptor in the lung specimen and VSMCs was performed by polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: The degree of PH, as determined by the medial thickness of small pulmonary arteries, was significantly increased in IL-6-PH rats as compared with normal control rats (p&lt;0.05), and that in IL-6-MCI-PH rats was not significantly different from that in normal control rats. The RV/LV + S weight ratio in the IL-6-PH rats was significantly higher than that in normal control rats (p &lt; 0.01). The RV/LV + S weight ratio in IL-6-MCI-PH rats was significantly lower than that in IL-6-PH rats (p &lt; 0.01) and was not significantly different from that in normal control rats. The serotonin concentration was significantly higher in IL-6-PH rats than in normal control rats (p &lt; 0.02), and the serotonin concentration in IL-6-MCI-PH rats was not significantly different from that in the normal control rats. The expression levels of the 5-HT receptor messenger RNA in the lung tissue tended to increase in IL-6-PH rats but was suppressed in IL-6-MCI-PH rats. IL-6 significantly increased the amount of serotonin released from VSMCs (p &lt; 0.02). The expression of the 5-HT receptor messenger RNA was observed with IL-6 stimulation as was observed with serotonin stimulation in VSMCs.

First, GP515 treatment resulted in a significant improvement of clinical score (weight loss, stool consistency, and bleeding) and of histologic score. Second, colon shortening, an indirect parameter for the degree of inflammation, was decreased, consistent with a decreased IFNgamma concentration in the colonic tissue. Third, spleen weight was reduced in GP515-treated DSS mice. And fourth, IFNgamma synthesis and CD69 expression, as a marker for early cell activation, of ex vivo-stimulated splenocytes were suppressed in the GP515-treated DSS mice. These studies show that GP515 is effective in the therapy of DSS-induced colitis. One potential mechanism of action is the suppression of IFNgamma synthesis and CD69 expression.

Infiltrating PMNs clear microorganisms but also cause tissue damage. We previously reported the presence in human bronchial lavage of a peptide that inhibits PMN functions. The current project assessed (1) effects of a synthetic analog of this peptide (synthetic neutrophil inhibitor peptide, SNIP) on IL-8-induced nasal inflammation in humans, (2) effects of SNIP on PMN apoptosis and chemotaxis, (3) specific binding of SNIP to PMNs, and (4) evidence of larger molecules with the SNIP sequence. Results show that SNIP attenuates IL-8-induced nasal inflammation, inhibits in vitro PMN chemotaxis to IL-8, and accentuates PMNs apoptosis. PMNs contain specific SNIP-binding sites and the integrin CR3 (CD11b/CD18), or a CR3-associated molecule, is one SNIP-binding molecule. Chemotaxis to IL-8 is most potently inhibited by SNIP in the presence of fibrinogen, a CR3 ligand. Antiserum against the SNIP sequence recognizes a 70-kDa protein in bronchoalveolar lavage and an anti-SNIP immunoaffinity column binds a 70-kDa protein in U937 cell culture supernatant. U937 cell mRNA contains a 1.8-kb transcript detected with degenerate oligonucleotides designed from the SNIP sequence.

Although the P3' area can accommodate a broad array of structurally diversified functional groups including polar residues, hydrophobic residues, and amino and carboxylic acid moieties, in both the cyclophane series and the cyclic carbamate series, a glycine residue at P3' was identified as a critical structural component to achieve both good in vitro potency and good oral activity.

At a dose of 3.2 mg/kg, sorbitol accumulation was inhibited by approximately 40% and there was a tendency to increase in NBF; however, minimal FWL was not improved at all. These data suggest that a highly inhibition of the nerve sorbitol accumulation is requisite for the treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathy.",

        "abstract": "Howiinol A (GHM-10) is a kind of phenylethylene pyrone compounds isolated from Goniothalamus howii. By using the techniques of cell growth curve determination, MTT test, soft agar colony assay and experimental therapy of transplantable tumors in mice, it is found that GHM-10 exerts potent inhibitory effect on cancer cells but its influence on normal cells is relatively slight; the sensitivity of a drug-resistant cell line, KB/VCR 2000, to GHM-10 is similar to its parent cell line KB. Remarkable therapeutic effect can be seen in mice bearing H22 hepatoma and Lewis lung cancer and in mice with ascetic sarcoma 180 when GHM-10 is orally or intraperitoneally administered. The IC50s of L1210 cells treated with GHM-10 for 1 and 24 h are 6.85 and 3.32 micrograms.ml-1 respectively. The ratio of IC50 1 h and IC50 24 h is only 2.06, indicating that the action of GHM-10 is conformed to a cell cycle non-specific cytotoxic agent. By using trypan blue exclusive test and morphological examination, it is demonstrated that the main effect of GHM-10 is to inhibit the cell proliferation. Flow cytometery technique is used to analyze the cell cycle of L1210 cells. The results show that to some extent, GHM-10 blocks the cell cycle transition from G1 phase to S phase. By using [3H] labeled precursor incorporation technique, it is shown that GHM-10 significantly suppresses the biosynthesis of DNA, RNA and protein in L1210 cells, and the DNA synthesis is mostly affected. At 1 h after the cells were treated with GHM-10, these inhibitory effects have already been irreversible, suggesting that GHM-10 may cause structural damage on DNA molecules. However, GHM-10 is unable to intercalate into DNA molecules or to destroy its structure directly. By using single cell gel electrophoresis and alkaline elution technology, it is confirmed that GHM-10 causes DNA molecule damage and single strand breakage in L1210 cells. Further studies show that GHM-10 markedly inhibits DNA dehelix induced by DNA topoisomerase II both inside and outside the cells, indicating that GHM-10 is acting as an inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase II.",

SK channels are small conductance K(+) channels normally activated by a rise in intracellular Ca(2+) concentration; they modulate the electrical excitability in neurons and neuroendocrine cells. When applied externally, chlorzoxazone, 1-EBIO, and zoxazolamine activated rSK2 channel currents in cells dialyzed with a nominally Ca(2+)-free intracellular solution. The activation was reversible, reproducible, and depended on the chemical structure and concentration. The order of potency was 1-EBIO &gt; chlorzoxazone &gt; zoxazolamine. Activation of rSK2 channels by chlorzoxazone, 1-EBIO, and zoxazolamine declined at higher drug concentrations. Zoxazolamine, when applied in combination with chlorzoxazone or 1-EBIO, partially inhibited the rSK2 channel current responses, suggesting a partial-agonist mode of action. 1-EBIO failed to activate rSK2 channel currents when applied to excised inside-out membrane patches exposed to a Ca(2+)-free intracellular solution. In contrast, 1-EBIO activated rSK2 currents in a concentration-dependent manner when coapplied to the patches with a solution containing 20 nM free Ca(2+). NS 1619 did not activate rSK2 channel currents; it inhibited rSK2 channel currents activated by the other three test compounds or by high intracellular Ca(2+). We conclude that chlorzoxazone and its derivatives act through a common mechanism to modulate rSK2 channels, and SK channel modulation in the brain may partly underlie the clinical effects of chlorzoxazone.",

Rec 15/3079 showed a selective high affinity for the 5-HT(1A) receptor (K(i) = 0.2 nM). At the human recombinant 5-HT(1A) receptor, Rec 15/3079 acted as a competitive, neutral antagonist in that it did not modify basal [(35)S]guanosine-5'-O-(3-thio)triphosphate binding to HeLa cell membranes but shifted the activation isotherm to 5-HT to the right, in a parallel manner, with a pK(b) value of 10.5. Accordingly, Rec 15/3079 (i.v.) potently antagonized 8-hydroxy-2-dipropylaminotetralin (8-OH-DPAT)-induced hypothermia in mice (ID(50) = 20 microg/kg) and 8-OH-DPAT-induced forepaw treading in rats (ID(50) = 36 microg/kg). In vitro Rec 15/3079 was poorly active in antagonizing carbachol-induced bladder (pD'(2) = 5.03) and norepinephrine-induced urethral (apparent pK(b) = 6) contractions. However, in anesthetized rats, Rec 15/3079 (10-100 microg/kg i.v.) blocked isovolumic bladder contractions with no effect on their amplitude. In conscious rats and guinea pigs with bladders filled with saline, Rec 15/3079 (300-1000 microg/kg i.v.) increased bladder volume capacity (BVC) without affecting bladder contractility. In conscious rats with bladders filled with dilute acetic acid, Rec 15/3079 (300 microg/kg i.v.) reversed the decrease of BVC induced by the acid. To evaluate apparent selective effect on lower urinary tract reflexes, Rec 15/3079 was tested in experimental models for sedative, analgesic, anxiolytic, and antidepressant activity. Rec 15/3079 showed only a slight decrease in the duration of immobility in the behavioral despair test (antidepressant activity) at 1 mg/kg i.v. No anxiolytic activity was observed at 10 mg/kg i.v. No effect was observed in the hot plate test, but Rec 15/3079 increased tail-flick latencies after 3 to 10 mg/kg i.v. In conclusion, these studies demonstrate that Rec 15/3079 is endowed with favorable effects on bladder function, and it is devoid of unwanted side effects at the level of central nervous system at doses at least 10-fold higher than those active on the bladder.",

Concomitantly with the increase in [Ca(2+)](i), 4alpha-PDD activated an outwardly rectifying cation channel with an Eisenman IV permeation sequence for monovalent cations that is Ca(2+)-permeable with P(Ca)/P(Na) = 5.8. Phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate also induced an increase in [Ca(2+)](i) but was approximately 50 times less effective than 4alpha-PDD. EC(50) for Ca(2+) increase and current activation was nearly identical (pEC(50) approximately 6.7). Similar effects were observed in freshly isolated mouse aorta endothelial cells which express TRP12 endogenously. By using 4alpha-PDD as a tool to stimulate TRP12, we showed that activation of this channel is modulated by [Ca(2+)](i); an increase in [Ca(2+)](i) inhibits the channel with an IC(50) of 406 nm. Ruthenium Red at a concentration of 1 microm completely blocks inward currents at -80 mV but has a smaller effect on outward currents likely indicating a voltage dependent channel block. We concluded that the phorbol derivatives activate TRPV4 (VR-OAC, VRL-2, OTRPC4, TRP12) independently from protein kinase C, in a manner consistent with direct agonist gating of the channel.",

        "abstract": "Novel scaffolds that bind to serine proteases through a unique network of short hydrogen bonds to the catalytic Ser195 have been developed. The resulting potent serine protease inhibitors were designed from lead molecule 2-(2-hydroxyphenyl)1H-benzoimidazole-5-carboxamidine, 6b, which is known to display several modes of binding. For instance, 6b can recruit zinc and bind in a manner similar to that reported by bis(5-amidino-2-benzimidazolyl)methane (BABIM) (Nature 1998, 391, 608-612).(1) Alternatively, 6b can bind in the absence of zinc through a multicentered network of short (&lt;2.3 A) hydrogen bonds. The lead structure was optimized in the zinc-independent binding mode toward a panel of six human serine proteases to yield optimized inhibitors such as 2-(3-bromo-2-hydroxy-5-methylphenyl)-1H-indole-5-carboxamidine, 22a, and 2-(2-hydroxybiphenyl-3-yl)-1H-indole-5-carboxamidine, 22f. Structure-activity relationships determined that, apart from the amidine function, an indole or benzimidazole and an ortho substituted phenol group were also essential components for optimal potency. The affinities (K(i)) of 22a and 22f, for example, bearing these groups ranged from 8 to 600 nM toward a panel of six human serine proteases. High-resolution crystal structures revealed that the binding mode of these molecules in several of the enzymes was identical to that of 6b and involved short (&lt;2.3 A) hydrogen bonds among the inhibitor hydroxyl oxygen, Ser195, and a water molecule trapped in the oxyanion hole. In summation, novel and potent trypsin-like serine protease inhibitors possessing a unique mode of binding have been discovered.",

The use of synthetic MMP inhibitors to block the proteolytic activity of these enzymes recently emerged as a potential therapeutic tool to treat cancer. In this study, we report that GI129471, a synthetic broad-spectrum MMP inhibitor, efficiently reduced the in vitro invasiveness of HT1080 cells through type IV collagen, a major component of basement membranes. This reduced invasion was paralleled by a complete inhibition of pro-MMP-2 activation; however, GI129471 strongly increased the amount of secreted pro-MMP-9, which could be subsequently activated through a plasminogen-dependent mechanism. Quantitative RT-PCR and northern blot analysis revealed that GI129471 specifically increased the MMP-9 mRNA steady-state level. Moreover, transient transfection of HT1080 cells with beta-galactosidase reporter vectors containing different lengths of the 5'-flanking region of the MMP-9 gene revealed an upregulation of the transcriptional activity of the corresponding promoter. Well-known modulators of MMP-9 expression such as Il-1beta and TNF-alpha were not involved in this upregulation.

Like other enzymes in the folate pathway, HPPK is an ideal target for the development of antimicrobial agents because the enzyme is essential for microorganisms but is absent from human and animals. Three bisubstrate analogues have been synthesized for HPPK and characterized by biochemical and X-ray crystallographic analyses. All three bisubstrate analogues consist of a pterin, an adenosine moiety, and a link composed of 2-4 phosphoryl groups. P(1)-(6-Hydroxymethylpterin)-P(2)-(5'-adenosyl)diphosphate (HP(2)A, 5) shows little affinity and inhibitory activity for E. coli HPPK. P(1)-(6-Hydroxymethylpterin)-P(3)-(5'-adenosyl)triphosphate (HP(3)A, 6) shows moderate affinity and inhibitory activity with K(d) = 4.25 microM in the presence of Mg(2+) and IC(50) = 1.27 microM. P(1)-(6-Hydroxymethylpterin)-P(4)-(5'-adenosyl)tetraphosphate (HP(4)A, 7) shows the highest affinity and inhibitory activity with K(d) = 0.47 microM in the presence of Mg(2+) and IC(50) = 0.44 microM. The affinity of MgHP(4)A for HPPK is approximately 116 and 76 times higher than that of MgADP and 6-hydroxymethylpterin, respectively. The crystal structure of HPPK in complex with 7 (HPPK.MgHP(4)A) has been determined at 1.85 A resolution with a crystallographic R factor of 0.185. The crystal structure shows that 7 occupies both HP- and ATP-binding sites and induces significant conformational changes in HPPK. The biochemical and structural studies of the bisubstrate analogues indicate that the bisubstrate analogue approach can produce more potent inhibitors for HPPK and the minimum length of the link for a bisubstrate analogue is approximately 7 A.",

        "title": "Protein kinase epsilon dampens the secretory response of model intestinal epithelia during ischemia.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Luminal fluid sequestration and diarrhea are early manifestations of mesenteric ischemia. This can be modeled in vitro with the use of T84 intestinal epithelia, where ischemia induces Cl(-) secretion with adenosine-mediated autocrine feedback. Protein kinase C (PKC) regulates epithelial transport and, in some organ systems, is involved in the response to ischemic stress. The purpose of this study was to define the role of PKC on epithelial transport during ischemia. METHODS: By voltage-current clamp, short-circuit current (Isc) equals Cl(-) secretion. Ischemic conditions were simulated with the use of a well-established chemical hypoxia protocol. RESULTS: Chemical hypoxia briskly activated Isc. Go6850, an antagonist of novel and conventional PKC isoforms, markedly enhanced the ischemia-induced Isc response, although Go6976 (which inhibits only conventional isoforms) had no effect. Rottlerin, a specific inhibitor of PKC delta, did not attenuate ischemic Isc. Both phorbol 12-myristate, 13-acetate and bryostatin-1, which selectively activate PKC epsilon in T84 cells, markedly attenuated the Isc response to ischemia. Both agents also inhibited the Isc response to exogenous adenosine. CONCLUSIONS: PKC (likely the novel epsilon isoform) in intestinal epithelia modulates ischemia-induced alterations in ion transport. Inhibition of PKC epsilon exaggerates the secretory response that is induced by ischemia and by authentic adenosine; conversely, augmented activation of PKC epsilon inhibits secretion. Manipulation of PKC epsilon could limit luminal fluid sequestration during mesenteric ischemia.",

METHODS: Chymase inhibitor SUN-C8257 was administered to mice infected with the nematode Nippostrongylus brasiliensis, and the number of eosinophils in the blood, serum IgE levels and fecal egg counts were determined. RESULTS: Administration of SUN-C8257 significantly inhibited blood eosinophilia in BALB/c mice infected with N. brasiliensis. The effect of SUN-C8257 was specific for eosinophils, in that it affected neither the number of total leukocytes nor serum IgE levels. SUN-C8257 did not alter the fecal egg counts in this model, showing that SUN-C8257 has no effect on infectivity and expulsion of the nematode. N. brasiliensis infection induced eosinophilia in mast cell-deficient mice (W/W(v)) as well as their littermates (+/+), and SUN-C8257 inhibited the eosinophilia in +/+ mice but not in W/W(v) mice. These results suggest that the eosinophil number may be regulated by different mechanisms in W/W(v) and +/+ mice, and that the effect of SUN-C8257 on nematode-induced eosinophilia is probably due to chymase inhibition. CONCLUSIONS: Chymase released by activated mast cells may play a role in helminth-induced eosinophilia.",

        "abstract": "Signal transduction modifiers that modulate the lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) pathway have potential as anticancer agents. Herein, we describe metabolically stabilized LPA analogues that reduce cell migration and invasion and cause regression of orthotopic breast tumors in vivo. Two diastereoisomeric alpha-bromophosphonates (BrP-LPA) were synthesized, and the pharmacology was determined for five LPA G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). The syn and anti diastereomers of BrP-LPA are pan-LPA GPCR antagonists and are also nanomolar inhibitors of the lysophospholipase D activity of autotaxin, the dominant biosynthetic source of LPA. Computational models correctly predicted the diastereoselectivity of antagonism for three GPCR isoforms. The anti isomer of BrP-LPA was more effective than syn isomer in reducing migration of MDA-MB-231 cells, and the anti isomer was superior in reducing invasion of these cells. Finally, orthotopic breast cancer xenografts were established in nude mice by injection of MB-231 cells in an in situ cross-linkable extracellular matrix. After 2 weeks, mice were treated with the BrP-LPA alone (10 mg/kg), Taxol alone (10 mg/kg), or Taxol followed by BrP-LPA. All treatments significantly reduced tumor burden, and BrP-LPA was superior to Taxol in reducing blood vessel density in tumors. Moreover, both the anti- and syn-BrP-LPA significantly reduced tumors at 3 mg/kg.",

Studies described here examine the functional significance of cathepsin S inhibition on autoantigen presentation and organ-specific autoimmune diseases in a murine model for Sjogren syndrome. Specific inhibitor of cathepsin S (Clik60) in vitro markedly impaired presentation of an organ-specific autoantigen, 120-kDa alpha-fodrin, by interfering with MHC class II-peptide binding. Autoantigen-specific T cell responses were significantly and dose-dependently inhibited by incubation with Clik60, but not with inhibitor s of cathepsin B or L. Clik60 treatment of mouse salivary gland cells selectively inhibited autopeptide-bound class II molecules. Moreover, the treatment with Clik60 in vivo profoundly blocked lymphocytic infiltration into the salivary and lacrimal glands, abrogated a rise in serum autoantibody production, and led to recovery from autoimmune manifestations. Thus, inhibition of cathepsin S in vivo alters autoantigen presentation and development of organ-specific autoimmunity.

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Ischemia-reperfusion injury is a relatively common cause of renal tubular cell death and acute renal failure. While nuclear factor-kappaB has been implicated in the pathophysiology of renal ischemia-reperfusion injury, the effect of nuclear factor-kappaB inhibition on ischemia induced renal tubular cell death remains unknown. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Renal tubular cells (LLC-PK1) were exposed to simulated ischemia in the presence or absence of 10 microM. pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (nuclear factor-kappaB inhibitor). Nuclear factor-kappaB activation (electrophoretic mobility shift assay and immunohistochemistry) and the effect of pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate on nuclear factor-kappaB activation (electrophoretic mobility shift assay) and ischemia induced apoptosis (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine triphosphate nick end-labeling) were determined. RESULTS: Simulated ischemia induced nuclear factor-kappaB activation and renal tubular cell apoptosis versus controls (mean plus or minus standard error of mean 62 +/- 5.2 versus 0.4 +/- 0.3 apoptotic nuclei per high power field, p &lt;0.05). In contrast, previous cellular exposure to pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate effectively inhibited nuclear factor-kappaB activation and prevented ischemia induced apoptosis (mean 14 +/- 6 apoptotic nuclei per high power field). CONCLUSIONS: Simulated ischemia induces nuclear factor-kappaB intranuclear translocation and activation in renal tubular cells. Furthermore, nuclear factor-kappaB mediates ischemia induced renal tubular cell apoptosis. Further elucidation of the complex role of nuclear factor-kappaB in inflammatory injury may lead to the development of targeted therapeutic strategies that ameliorate ischemic renal injury.",

This study describes the effects of a new and potent DPP-IV inhibitor, FE 999011, which is able to suppress plasma DPP-IV activity for 12 h after a single oral administration. In the Zucker fatty rat, FE 999011 dose-dependently attenuated glucose excursion during an oral glucose tolerance test and increased GLP-1 (7-36) release in response to intraduodenal glucose. Chronic treatment with FE 999011 (10 mg/kg, twice a day for 7 days) improved glucose tolerance, as suggested by a decrease in the insulin-to-glucose ratio. In the Zucker diabetic fatty (ZDF) rat, a rodent model of type 2 diabetes, chronic treatment with FE 999011 (10 mg/kg per os, once or twice a day) postponed the development of diabetes, with the twice-a-day treatment delaying the onset of hyperglycemia by 21 days. In addition, treatment with FE 999011 stabilized food and water intake to prediabetic levels and reduced hypertriglyceridemia while preventing the rise in circulating free fatty acids. At the end of treatment, basal plasma GLP-1 levels were increased, and pancreatic gene expression for GLP-1 receptor was significantly upregulated. This study demonstrates that DPP-IV inhibitors such as FE 999011 could be of clinical value to delay the progression from impaired glucose tolerance to type 2 diabetes.",

        "abstract": "Triptolide, a major component in the extract of Chinese herbal plant Tripterygium wilfordii Hook f (TWHf), has potential anti-neoplastic effect. In the present study we investigated the potential therapeutic effects and mechanisms of triptolide against human gastric cancer cells. Four gastric cancer cell lines with different p53 status, AGS and MKN-45 (wild type p53); MKN-28 and SGC-7901 (mutant p53) were observed as to cell growth inhibition and induction of apoptosis in response to triptolide treatment. We showed that triptolide inhibited cell growth, induced apoptosis and suppressed NK-kappaB and AP-1 transactivation in AGS cells with wild-type p53. Triptolide induced apoptosis by stimulating the expressions of p53, p21(waf1/cip1), bax protein, and increased the activity of caspases. In addition, it caused cell cycle arrest in the G(0)/G(1) phase. To examine the role of p53 in these functions, we showed that suppression of p53 level with antisense oligonucleotide abrogated triptolide-induced apoptosis and over-expression of dominant negative p53 abolished the inhibitory effect on NF-kappaB activation. Furthermore, we demonstrated that triptolide had differential effects on gastric cancer cells with different p53 status. We showed that triptolide also inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis in MKN-45 with wild-type p53, whereas it had no significant growth-inhibition and apoptosis induction effects on the MKN-28 and SGC-7901 cells with mutant p53. Our data suggest that triptolide exhibits anti-tumor and anti-inflammatory effects by inhibiting cell proliferation, inducing apoptosis and inhibiting NF-kappaB and AP-1 transcriptional activity.

        "title": "Evidence that the clinical effects of cholinesterase inhibitors are related to potency and targeting of action.",
        "abstract": "Since degenerative alterations associated with cholinergic changes in the brains of demented patients occur in specific regions, optimal efficacy may be achieved by targeting the actions of potent cholinesterase inhibitors in relevant regions. When evaluating the activities of these agents, only cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-based studies in demented patients provide reliable data. Preclinical or healthy volunteer studies of cholinesterase inhibitory activity using plasma or erythrocytes as an enzyme source are inconclusive due to differences between enzymes, their relative activities, and the profiles of their isoforms from different sources, with additional changes during disease progression. Tacrine and rivastigmine inhibit both acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) in the CSF of Alzheimer's disease patients. Both enzymes are involved in the breakdown of acetylcholine (ACh) in the brain and dual inhibition may lead to greater, broader efficacy, as well as a greater potential for disease modification. However, potent and rapid elevation in levels of ACh may also induce more acute tolerability problems, such as nausea and vomiting. Only rivastigmine appears to show brain region-selectivity, particularly for regions involved in attention and behaviour and that are known to degenerate during the progression of various dementia types. This selectivity is due to preferential inhibition of the G1 form of AChE and, probably, also BuChE. Cholinesterase inhibitors that lack preferential selectivity for particular isoforms may provide less targeted actions. This may explain the relatively higher incidences of certain peripheral side effects observed during maintenance treatment with some of these drugs. All cholinesterase inhibitors interact via ACh, additionally available due to enzyme inhibition, with nicotinic and muscarinic receptors (nAChRs and mAChRs). Allosteric modulation of a presynaptic nAChR has been shown in vitro with many of these agents, and it has been proposed, but not demonstrated, that this may result in an increased release and potentiation of ACh in the brain. The clinical relevance of this mechanism is unknown. The rapidly reversible actions of donepezil, tacrine and galantamine may lead to tolerance due to their ability to upregulate target enzyme activities; however upregulation is not seen with the slowly reversible (pseudo-irreversible) inhibitor rivastigmine. Available clinical data support the hypothesis that potent, slowly reversible inhibitors of AChE and BuChE targeted to the G1 isoforms may lead to greater, broader and more sustained benefits. However, further investigation of the cholinesterase inhibitors to elucidate more definitely the clinical consequences of their differing pharmacological properties is required.",

This study examines the effect of isohelenin in endotoxic shock induced by administration of Escherichia coli endotoxin in male Wistar rats. A group of rats received isohelenin (2 mg/kg intraperitoneally) 15 min before endotoxin. In vehicle-treated rats, administration of endotoxin caused severe hypotension, which was associated with a marked hyporeactivity to norepinephrine and acetylcholine in ex vivo aortas. Elevated levels of plasma nitrate/nitrite, metabolites of nitric oxide (NO), were also found. These inflammatory events were preceded by cytosolic degradation of inhibitor-kappaBalpha (IkappaBalpha) and activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) in the lung within 15 min of endotoxin administration. Treatment with isohelenin resulted in hemodynamic improvement and reduced plasma levels of NO metabolites. Nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB was inhibited by isohelenin treatment in the lung, whereas degradation of IkappaBalpha was unchanged. In a separate set of experiments, treatment with isohelenin significantly improved survival in mice challenged with endotoxin. We conclude that isohelenin exerts beneficial therapeutic effects during endotoxic shock through inhibition of NF-kappaB.",

        "abstract": "The mechanism by which minoxidil, an adenosine-triphosphate-sensitive potassium channel opener, induces hypertrichosis remains to be elucidated. Minoxidil has been reported to stimulate the production of vascular endothelial growth factor, a possible promoter of hair growth, in cultured dermal papilla cells. The mechanism of production of vascular endothelial growth factor remains unclear, however. We hypothesize that adenosine serves as a mediator of vascular endothelial growth factor production. Minoxidil-induced increases in levels of intracellular Ca(2+) and vascular endothelial growth factor production in cultured dermal papilla cells were found to be inhibited by 8-sulfophenyl theophylline, a specific antagonist for adenosine receptors, suggesting that dermal papilla cells possess adenosine receptors and sulfonylurea receptors, the latter of which is a well-known target receptor for adenosine-triphosphate-sensitive potassium channel openers. The expression of sulfonylurea receptor 2B and of the adenosine A1, A2A, and A2B receptors was detected in dermal papilla cells by means of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis. In order to determine which of the adenosine receptor subtypes contribute to minoxidil-induced hair growth, the effects of subtype-specific antagonists for adenosine receptors were investigated. Significant inhibition in increase in intracellular calcium level by minoxidil or adenosine was observed as the result of pretreatment with 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine, an antagonist for adenosine A1 receptor, but not by 3,7-dimethyl-1-propargyl-xanthine, an antagonist for adenosine A2 receptor, whereas vascular endothelial growth factor production was blocked by both adenosine A1 and A2 receptor antagonists. These results indicate that the effect of minoxidil is mediated by adenosine, which triggers intracellular signal transduction via both adenosine A1 and A2 receptors, and that the expression of sulfonylurea receptor 2B in dermal papilla cells might play a role in the production of adenosine.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Kynureninase is a key enzyme on the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan metabolism. One of the end products of the pathway is the neurotoxin quinolinic acid which appears to be responsible for neuronal cell death in a number of important neurological diseases. This makes kynureninase a possible therapeutic target for diseases such as Huntington's, Alzheimer's and AIDS related dementia, and the development of potent inhibitors an important research aim. RESULTS: Two new kynurenine analogues, 3-hydroxydesaminokynurenine and 3-methoxydesaminokynurenine, were synthesised as inhibitors of kynureninase and tested on the tryptophan-induced bacterial enzyme from Pseudomonas fluorescens, the recombinant human enzyme and the rat hepatic enzyme. They were found to be mixed inhibitors of all three enzymes displaying both competitive and non competitive inhibition. The 3-hydroxy derivative gave low Ki values of 5, 40 and 100 nM respectively. An improved 3-step purification scheme for recombinant human kynureninase was also developed. CONCLUSION: For kynureninase from all three species the 2-amino group was found to be crucial for activity whilst the 3-hydroxyl group played a fundamental role in binding at the active site presumably via hydrogen bonding. The potency of the various inhibitors was found to be species specific. The 3-hydroxylated inhibitor had a greater affinity for the human enzyme, consistent with its specificity for 3-hydroxykynurenine as substrate, whilst the methoxylated version yielded no significant difference between bacterial and human kynureninase.

Transgenic mice with cardiac-restricted overexpression of Galpha(q) exhibit a lethal, peripartum cardiomyopathy accompanied by apoptosis. To test whether apoptosis is causally linked to heart failure, we assessed whether inhibiting this cell death would improve left ventricular function and survival in the Galpha(q) peripartum cardiomyopathy model. METHODS AND RESULTS: The potent polycaspase inhibitor IDN-1965 or vehicle was administered subcutaneously to Galpha(q) mice by osmotic minipump beginning on day 12 of pregnancy and continuing through euthanasia at day 14 postpartum. As expected, IDN-1965 markedly suppressed cardiac caspase-3-like activity (86.5%; P&lt;0.01), accompanied by reduction in the frequency of cardiac myocyte apoptosis from 1.9+/-0.3% to 0.2+/-0.1% (P&lt;0.01).

CONCLUSIONS: Reduction in cardiac myocyte apoptosis by caspase inhibition improved left ventricular function and survival in pregnant Galpha(q) mice.

In rat isolated myometrium, OT-induced uterine contractions were competitively antagonized by SSR126768A (pA(2) = 8.47). Similarly, in human pregnant myometrial strips, SSR126768A inhibited the contractile uterine response to OT. In conscious telemetrated rats, oral administration of SSR126768A (1-10 mg/kg) produced a competitive inhibition of the dose response to OT on uterine contractions up to 24 h at 3 mg/kg p.o.; no tachyphylaxis was observed after 4-day repeated treatment. Finally, SSR126768A (30 mg/kg p.o.) significantly delayed parturition in pregnant rats in labor similar to ritodrine (10 mg/kg p.o.). Thus, SSR126768A is a potent, highly selective, orally active OT receptor antagonist with a long duration of action. This molecule could find therapeutic application as a tocolytic agent for acute and chronic oral management of preterm labor.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: The transcription of several cytokines, cell adhesion molecules, and enzymes involved in the inflammatory and destructive mechanisms of rheumatoid arthritis is dependent on nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappa B). Because I kappa B kinase (IKK) is critical in transducing the signal-inducible activation of NF-kappa B, we examined whether the highly selective and orally bioavailable IKK inhibitor BMS-345541 is efficacious against collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) in mice. METHODS: Arthritis in DBA/1LacJ male mice was induced by subcutaneous immunization with bovine type II collagen on day 0 and day 21. BMS-345541 was administered perorally daily, either prophylactically (before disease onset) or therapeutically (after disease onset). Clinical assessment of the incidence and severity of disease was conducted throughout the study, and histologic evaluation was performed at the time of study termination (day 42). RESULTS: When administered prophylactically, BMS-345541 (in a dose range of 10-100 mg/kg) was effective, in a dose-dependent manner, in reducing the incidence of disease and inhibiting clinical signs of disease. Histologic evaluation of the joints showed that both inflammation and joint destruction were blocked by the IKK inhibitor. Message levels of interleukin-1 beta in the joints were also dose-dependently inhibited in the mice that received BMS-345541. Dose-dependent efficacy in terms of both disease severity and histologic end points was observed with the therapeutic dosing regimen of BMS-345541, with use of the 100-mg/kg dose resulting in resolution of disease. CONCLUSION: IKK plays a key role in CIA in mice, and inhibitors of this enzyme represent a promising target for the development of novel agents to treat rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory diseases. BMS-345541 represents the first example of an inhibitor of IKK that has antiinflammatory activity in vivo.",

        "abstract": "Glucokinase (GK) has a major role in the control of blood glucose homeostasis and is a strong potential target for the pharmacological treatment of type 2 diabetes. We report here the mechanism of action of two novel and potent direct activators of GK: 6-[(3-isobutoxy-5-isopropoxybenzoyl)amino]nicotinic acid(GKA1) and 5-([3-isopropoxy-5-[2-(3-thienyl)ethoxy]benzoyl]amino)-1,3,4-thiadiazole-2-carboxylic acid(GKA2), which increase the affinity of GK for glucose by 4- and 11-fold, respectively. GKA1 increased the affinity of GK for the competitive inhibitor mannoheptulose but did not affect the affinity for the inhibitors palmitoyl-CoA and the endogenous 68-kDa regulator (GK regulatory protein [GKRP]), which bind to allosteric sites or to N-acetylglucosamine, which binds to the catalytic site. In hepatocytes, GKA1 and GKA2 stimulated glucose phosphorylation, glycolysis, and glycogen synthesis to a similar extent as sorbitol, a precursor of fructose 1-phosphate, which indirectly activates GK through promoting its dissociation from GKRP. Consistent with their effects on isolated GK, these compounds also increased the affinity of hepatocyte metabolism for glucose. GKA1 and GKA2 caused translocation of GK from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. This effect was additive with the effect of sorbitol and is best explained by a \"glucose-like\" effect of the GK activators in translocating GK to the cytoplasm. In conclusion, GK activators are potential antihyperglycemic agents for the treatment of type 2 diabetes through the stimulation of hepatic glucose metabolism by a mechanism independent of GKRP.",

This is mainly due to the so-called minimal residual disease, i.e., remaining tumor cells that overcome surgery and/or radiotherapy and are the cause of locoregional and distant metastases. To metastasize, tumor cells take advantage of proteases to invade and remodel surrounding tissues. Here, we analyzed the efficiency of WX-UK1, a novel 3-amidinophenylalanine-based inhibitor of the uPA system, at inhibiting the invasive capacity of carcinoma cells. First, uPAR expression was characterized in different carcinoma cell lines, including SCCHN, breast and cervical carcinoma. Thereafter, the invasive potential of these cell lines was determined using Matrigel invasion chambers and a spheroid cocultivation model with human fibroblasts. uPAR expression levels correlated positively with invasion capacity, which could be significantly inhibited by WX-UK1. A decrease of tumor cell invasion by up to 50% was achieved in both models with the SCCHN line FaDu and the cervical carcinoma line HeLa after treatment with WX-UK1. Thus, our results demonstrate the potential of WX-UK1 in vitro as a promising adjuvant antimetastatic therapy of carcinomas.",

        "abstract": "Six of the mammalian transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channel subtypes are nonselective cation channels that can be activated by increases or decreases in ambient temperature. Five of them can alternatively be activated by nonthermal stimuli such as capsaicin [transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 (TRPV1)] or hypo-osmolarity (TRPV2 and TRPV4). No nonthermal stimuli have yet been described for TRPV3, a warmth-gated ion channel expressed prominently in skin keratinocytes. Here, we demonstrate that 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB), a compound used to inhibit store-operated Ca2+ channels and IP3 receptors, produces robust activation of recombinant TRPV3 in human embryonic kidney 293 cells with an EC50 of 28 microm. 2-APB also sensitizes TRPV3 to activation by heat, even at subthreshold concentrations. In inside-out membrane patches from TRPV3-expressing cells, 2-APB increases the open probability of TRPV3. Also, whereas heat alone is capable of activating TRPV3-mediated currents in only a small proportion of primary mouse keratinocytes, 2-APB activates heat-evoked, TRPV3-mediated currents in the majority of these cells. Together, these findings identify 2-APB as the first known chemical activator of TRPV3 and enhance the notion that TRPV3 participates in the detection of heat by keratinocytes.",

METHODS: Eighteen healthy male volunteers received RWJ-68023 in two different doses or placebo for 135 min. After 45 min, subjects received a motilin infusion for 90 min. Proximal gastric volume was measured with a barostat at constant pressure and during isobaric distensions. Abdominal symptoms were scored using visual analogue scales. Motilin and RWJ-68023 concentrations were assessed by radioimmunoassay and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, respectively. RESULTS: Both dosages of RWJ-68023 were safe and well tolerated. The most common adverse events were of gastrointestinal origin. RWJ-68023 did not affect basal proximal gastric volume, but the high-dose RWJ-68023 reduced the contractile effect of motilin on the stomach. This antagonizing effect of RWJ-68023 was only significant (P = 0.014) during the distension procedure. CONCLUSIONS: The RWJ-68023 doses used in this study were selected to accomplish plasma concentrations that would block the motilin effect entirely.

        "abstract": "An 18-kDa leukocyte membrane protein, termed 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (FLAP), has recently been shown to be the target of two structurally distinct classes of leukotriene biosynthesis inhibitors. These classes of inhibitors are based on indole and quinoline structures and are represented by MK-886 and L-674,573, respectively. A novel class of hybrid structure based on the indole and quinoline classes of inhibitors, termed quindoles, has recently been developed. These compounds, exemplified by L-689,037, are potent inhibitors of leukotriene biosynthesis, both in vitro and in vivo. In the present study, we have developed and characterized a potent radioiodinated photoaffinity analogue of L-689,037, termed [125I]L-691,678. This compound was used in immunoprecipitation studies with FLAP antisera to show that the quindole series of leukotriene biosynthesis inhibitors interact directly with FLAP. In addition, we show that MK-886, L-674,573, and L-689,037 specifically compete, in a concentration-dependent manner, with both [125I]L-691,678 and [125I]L-669,083, a photoaffinity analogue of MK-886, for binding to FLAP. These results suggest that these three classes of leukotriene biosynthesis inhibitors share a common binding site on FLAP, providing further evidence that FLAP represents a suitable target for structurally diverse classes of leukotriene biosynthesis inhibitors.",

To ensure that the \"agonist-preferring\" conformation of the receptor was preferentially labelled in competition binding experiments, saturation analysis was conducted using antagonist and agonist radiolabels at each receptor. Antagonist radiolabels ([3H]-ketanserin for 5-HT(2A) receptor and [3H]-mesulergine for 5-HT(2B) and 5-HT(2C) receptor) bound to a larger population of receptors in each preparation than the corresponding agonist radiolabel ([125I]-DOI for 5-HT(2A) receptor binding and [3H]-5-HT for 5-HT(2B) and 5-HT(2C) receptor binding). Competition experiments were subsequently conducted against appropriate concentrations of the agonist radiolabels bound to the \"agonist-preferring\" subset of receptors in each preparation. These studies confirmed that there are a number of highly selective antagonists available to investigate 5-HT2 receptor subtype function (for example, MDL 100907, RS-127445 and RS-102221 for 5-HT(2A), 5-HT(2B) and 5-HT(2C) receptors respectively). There remains, however, a lack of highly selective agonists. (-)DOI is potent and moderately selective for 5-HT(2A) receptors, BW723C86 has poor selectivity for human 5-HT(2B) receptors, while Org 37684 and VER-3323 display some selectivity for the 5-HT(2C) receptor. We report for the first time in a single study, the selectivity of numerous serotonergic drugs for 5-HT2 receptors from the same species, in mammalian cell lines and using, exclusively, agonist radiolabels.

It has previously been shown that high-dose tamoxifen has cytotoxic activity against glioma cells, but whether this effect is drug specific or represents a general property of SERMs is unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that tamoxifen and CC-8490, a novel benzopyranone with SERM activity, induce glioma cell apoptosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Moreover, administration of tamoxifen and CC-8490 suppresses tumor growth in vivo and extends animal survival in glioma xenograft models. None of the eight glioma cell lines examined express either ER-alpha or -beta, suggesting the mechanism for tamoxifen- and CC-8490-induced glioma cell apoptosis is independent of the ER signaling pathway. Complementary DNA microarray expression profiling allowed us to identify a subset of genes specifically regulated by tamoxifen and CC-8490, and not by other apoptotic stimuli, including nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB with its target genes IEX-3, SOD2, IL6, and IL8. We demonstrate that suppression of NF-kappaB activation markedly enhances SERM-induced apoptosis, suggesting a role for NF-kappaB in protecting glioma cells from SERM-induced cytotoxicity. These findings demonstrate for the first time that a SERM other than tamoxifen can induce glioma cell apoptosis in vitro and in vivo and that the clinical efficacy of SERMs for the treatment of malignant gliomas could potentially be enhanced by simultaneous inhibition of the NF-kappaB pathway.",

Antagonizing the glucagon receptor is expected to result in reduced hepatic glucose overproduction, leading to overall glycemic control. Here we report the discovery and characterization of compound 1 (Cpd 1), a compound that inhibits binding of 125I-labeled glucagon to the human glucagon receptor with a half-maximal inhibitory concentration value of 181 +/- 10 nmol/l. In CHO cells overexpressing the human glucagon receptor, Cpd 1 increased the half-maximal effect for glucagon stimulation of adenylyl cyclase with a KDB of 81 +/- 11 nmol/l. In addition, Cpd 1 blocked glucagon-mediated glycogenolysis in primary human hepatocytes. In contrast, a structurally related analog (Cpd 2) was not effective in blocking glucagon-mediated biological effects. Real-time measurement of glycogen synthesis and breakdown in perfused mouse liver showed that Cpd 1 is capable of blocking glucagon-induced glycogenolysis in a dosage-dependent manner. Finally, when dosed in humanized mice, Cpd 1 blocked the rise of glucose levels observed after intraperitoneal administration of exogenous glucagon.

METHODS: This was a double-blind, single dose, randomized crossover study in eight healthy volunteers who received a single oral, fasting dose of V11294A (300 mg) or placebo. Blood samples were taken before and 0.5, 1, 2, 2.5, 3, 4, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 h after oral dosing for determination of plasma concentrations of V11294A. Blood samples were also taken before and 3 and 24 h after dosing for the assessment of the effect of V11294A on mononuclear cell proliferation and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) release in whole blood. RESULTS: Following a single oral dose of 300 mg V11294A, plasma concentrations of V11294A and its active metabolite V10332 reached Cmax (ng ml-1; mean +/- s.d.; 1398 +/- 298, 1000 +/- 400, respectively) after 2.63 +/- 0.79 and 5.9 +/- 2.3 h, respectively. For V11294A and V10332, t1/2 were 9.7 +/- 3.9 and 9.5 +/- 1.7 h, and AUC(0, infinity ) were 18100 +/- 6100 and 18600 +/- 8500 ng ml-1 h, respectively. At 3 h dosing, plasma concentrations of V11294A and V10332 (3-(3-cyclopentyloxy-4-methoxy-benzyl)-8-isopropyl-3H-purin-6-ylamine) were 1300 +/- 330 and 860 +/- 300 ng ml-1, 7 and 3 times their in vitro IC50s for inhibition of TNF release and proliferation, respectively. Treatment with V11294A resulted in a significant reduction of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced TNF release at 3 h (P &lt; 0.001) and at 24 h (P &lt; 0.05) post ingestion. The amount of TNF released (pmol ml-1) in response to a submaximal concentration of LPS (4 ng ml-1) was not significantly altered following placebo treatment (before 681 +/- 68 vs 3 h postdose 773 +/- 109, P = 0.27). In contrast, there was a significant reduction in the amount of TNF released following treatment with V11294A (before 778 +/- 87 vs 3 h postdose 566 +/- 72, P = 0.02). Phytohaemagluttinin (PHA) stimulated the incorporation of [3H]-thymidine in whole blood prior to drug administration. V11294A inhibited the PHA-induced proliferation at 3 h (P &lt; 0.05). No adverse reactions were noted following single oral administration of V11294A.

        "title": "Safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of oral S-3304, a novel matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor, in single and multiple dose escalation studies in healthy volunteers.",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: A novel sulfonamide derivative, S-3304, was discovered as a potent matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) inhibitor. It is a more specific inhibitor to MMP-2 and MMP-9 (in vitro) than to MMP-1, and may therefore lack the musculoskeletal side effects seen with non-specific inhibitors. The aim of the present study was to investigate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of S-3304 when administered as single and multiple oral doses to healthy male volunteers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 48 male volunteers received single oral doses ranging from 10 - 800 mg S-3304 or placebo under fasting conditions. At the 200 mg dose level, effects of high-fat diets were studied in a crossover design. In the multiple dose design, 24 male subjects were administered 200 mg, 400 mg or 800 mg S-3304 or placebo b.i.d. after meals for 10 - 17 days. Studies were conducted in a randomized double-blind fashion. Safety assessment was conducted based on blood chemistry, hematology, urinalysis, electrocardiogram and physical examination. Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined for S-3304 and its metabolites. All subjects were enrolled in the studies after obtaining informed consent. RESULTS: Adverse events reported after single dose administration of S-3304 or placebo were all of mild severity. Adverse events reported in the multiple dose treatment with S-3304 or placebo were mostly of mild severity, except for two episodes of moderate headache and two episodes of moderate myalgia. Most commonly reported adverse events in the multiple treatments with S-3304 were headache and somnolence. No clinically significant changes were observed in the clinical laboratory tests, except for reversible elevation of alanine aminotransferase of one subject at 800 mg S-3304 b.i.d. In the single dose administration, Cmax and mean AUC0-infinity linearly increased up to 63,167 ng/ml and 311,960 ng x h/ml at the 800 mg dose level, respectively; tmax and t1/2 ranged from 2 - 3 hours and from 9.5 - 15.5 hours, respectively. High-fat diets reduced Cmax from 21,565 ng/ml to 14,095 ng/ml but did not alter AUC0-infinity. Hydroxylated metabolites were detected in plasma in concentrations less than 1% of S-3304. Less than 1% S-3304 was excreted in urine. The AUC of one dosing interval and Cmax did not change after multiple doses but t1/2 increased from 9.5 - 10.0 hours to 12.5 - 13.5 hours. The 6beta-hydroxycortisol/ cortisol ratio was not changed after multiple doses suggesting no effect on CYP3A4 activity. CONCLUSION: S-3304 demonstrated a good safety profile and good systemic exposure when administered orally up to 800 mg b.i.d. during 10 - 17 days. At the highest dose level of 800 mg b.i.d., it was free of rheumatoid arthritis-like symptoms.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of adenosine kinase inhibition on interleukin (IL)-1beta- and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced cartilage damage. DESIGN: Articular cartilage was obtained from the metacarpophalangeal joints of 10 young adult horses. Following a stabilization period, weighed cartilage explants were exposed to IL-1beta (10 ng/ml) or LPS (50 microg/ml) to induce cartilage degradation. To test the potential protective effects of adenosine, these explants were simultaneously exposed to adenosine (100 microM), the adenosine kinase inhibitor 5'iodotubercidin (ITU, 1 microM) or to both adenosine and ITU. After 72 h in culture, conditioned medium was collected for evaluation of glycosaminoglycan (GAG), nitric oxide (NO), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-3 release. RESULTS: IL-1beta and LPS stimulated significant release of GAG, NO, PGE2 and MMP-3. Incubation with ITU significantly inhibited both IL-1beta- and LPS-induced GAG release, but did not alter MMP-3 production. Exposure to ITU also reduced IL-1beta-induced PGE2 release and LPS-induced NO production. Direct adenosine supplementation did not attenuate the effects of IL-1beta or LPS, and the addition of adenosine or ITU in the absence of IL-1beta or LPS did not have any detectable effect on cartilage metabolism in this model. CONCLUSIONS: The adenosine kinase inhibitor ITU attenuated experimentally induced cartilage damage in an in vitro cartilage explant model. Release of adenosine from chondrocytes may play a role in the cellular response to tissue damage in arthritic conditions and modulation of these pathways in the joint may have potential for treatment of arthropathies.",

The hypotensive potency of DU-1777 was not as marked as that of lisinopril in renin-dependent hypertensive models, i.e., two-kidney one-clip renal hypertensive rats (2K-1C RHR) (ED-20mmHg: 3.1 versus 1.0 mg/kg) or two-kidney two-clip renal hypertensive dogs (2K-2C RHD) (ED-20 mmHg: 2.5 versus 1.0 mg/kg), though the actions of the two drugs were both long-lasting and dose-related. When spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) were used, however, DU-1777 was as active as lisinopril (ED-20 mmHg: 17.9 versus 13.6 mg/kg). The most distinguishing results with DU-1777 were its hypotensive effects in renin-independent hypertensive models. In contrast to lisinopril, the drug produced a sustained and dose-related hypotensive effect in DOCA salt hypertensive rats (DOCA-HR) and one-kidney one-clip renal hypertensive rats (1K-1C RHR). There exists an inconsistency between the long duration of the agent's hypotensive action in all tested hypertensive models and its short duration of ACE inhibiting activity as demonstrated both in vivo and ex vivo.

FLT3-ITD has therefore been considered to be an attractive molecular target for a novel therapeutic modality. We describe here the identification and characterization of Ki23819 as a novel FLT3 inhibitor. Ki23819 suppressed proliferation and induced apoptosis of FLT3-ITD-expressing human leukemia cell lines. The growth-inhibitory effect of Ki23819 on MV4-11 cells was superior to that of SU11248, another FLT3 inhibitor (IC(50)&lt;1 vs 3-10 nM). Ki23819 inhibited the autophosphorylation of FLT3-ITD more efficiently than that of wild-type FLT3.

Against hCA I the investigated thiols showed inhibition constants in the range of 97 nM to 548 microM, against hCA II in the range of 7.9-618 microM, and against hCA IX in the range of 9.3-772 microM. Thiadiazoles were generally more active than triazoles against all investigated isozymes. Generally, the best inhibitors were the simple derivative 5-amino-1,3,4-thiadiazole-2-thiol and its N-acetylated derivative, which were anyhow at least two orders of magnitude less effective inhibitors when compared to the corresponding sulfonamides, acetazolamide, and its deacetylated derivative. An exception was constituted by 5-(2-pyridylcarboxamido)-1,3,4-thiadiazole-2-thiol, which is the first hCA I-selective inhibitor ever reported, possessing an inhibition constant of 97 nM against isozyme I, and being a 105 times less effective hCA II inhibitor, and 3154 times less effective hCA IX inhibitor.

Radioligand binding experiments were performed in the absence and presence of diverse allosteric modulators on both wild-type (wt) and mutant (T277A) adenosine A1 receptors. Thermodynamic data were obtained by performing these assays at different temperatures. In addition, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) assays were performed. The presence of allosteric modulators had diverse effects on the affinity of LUF5831, N6-cyclopentyladenosine (CPA), a full agonist, and 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (DPCPX), an inverse agonist/antagonist, for the adenosine A1 receptor. PD81,723, for example, increased the affinity of CPA, while the affinity of LUF5831 was decreased. However, the affinity of DPCPX was decreased even more. In addition, LUF5831 was shown to have an affinity for the mutant (T277A) adenosine A1 receptor (Ki=122+/-22 nM), whereas CPA's affinity was negligible. The results of temperature-dependent binding assays showed that the binding of LUF5831 was entropy driven, in between the behaviour of CPA binding to the high- and low-affinity states of the receptor, respectively. The inhibition of the forskolin-induced production of cAMP through activation of the wt adenosine A1 receptor showed that LUF5831 had a submaximal effect (37+/-1%) in comparison to CPA (66+/-5%). On the mutant receptor, however, neither CPA nor LUF5831 inhibited cAMP production. This study indicates that the nonribose ligand, LUF5831, is a partial agonist for the adenosine A1 receptor.",

In human platelets, the receptor affinities (pKi) were 9.3 +/- 0.1 and 7.7 +/- 0.03, respectively; in a recombinant IP receptor system, pKi values were 8.7 +/- 0.06 and 6.9 +/- 0.1, respectively. Functional antagonism of RO1138452 and RO3244794 was studied by measuring inhibition of carbaprostacyclin-induced cAMP accumulation in CHO-K1 cells stably expressing the human IP receptor.

        "abstract": "Brain subjected to acute ischemic attack caused by an arterial blockage needs immediate arterial recanalization. However, restoration of cerebral blood flow can cause tissue injury, which is termed reperfusion injury. It is important to inhibit reperfusion injury to achieve greater brain protection. Because oxidative stress has been shown to activate mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), and because oxidative stress contributes to reperfusion injury, MAPK may be a potential target to inhibit reperfusion injury after brain ischemia. Here, we demonstrate that reperfusion after forebrain ischemia dramatically increases phosphorylation level of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2) in the gerbil hippocampus. In addition, i.v. administration of U0126 (100-200 mg/kg), a specific inhibitor of MEK (MAPK/ERK kinase), protects the hippocampus against forebrain ischemia. Moreover, treatment with U0126 at 3 h after ischemia significantly reduces infarct volume after transient (3 h) focal cerebral ischemia in mice. This protection is accompanied by reduced phosphorylation level of ERK2, substrates for MEK, in the damaged brain areas. Furthermore, U0126 protects mouse primary cultured cortical neurons against oxygen deprivation for 9 h as well as nitric oxide toxicity. These results provide further evidence for the role of MEK/ERK activation in brain injury resulting from ischemia/reperfusion, and indicate that MEK inhibition may increase the resistance of tissue to ischemic injury.",

Chemically pure, well-characterized reference standards of conjugates of 3 were required for investigation of the routes of metabolism in several animal species (including humans) and for pharmacokinetic studies. The lack of suitable literature precedents for efficient, regioselective synthesis of nitrocatechol conjugate metabolites prompted us to develop efficient and highly selective chemical preparations of O-glucuronide and O-sulfate conjugates of 3 such that multigram quantities of excellent purity can now be conveniently synthesized. It is anticipated that these procedures could be applied to the synthesis of conjugates of other COMT inhibitors, also based on the 3-nitrocatechol pharmacophore.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Smooth muscle cell proliferation (SMC) is a pivotal factor in the development of intimal hyperplasia after vascular injury. A number of growth factors, including insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), have been shown to be involved in SMC proliferation. We evaluated the effect of picropodophyllin (PPP), a new IGF-1 receptor inhibitor, in the prevention of SMC proliferation and development of intimal hyperplasia after vascular injury. METHODS: The effects of systemic administration of PPP on intimal hyperplasia were studied in a balloon rat carotid injury model. Lesions were quantified by morphometry and SMC proliferation and apoptosis was studied by immunohistochemical staining for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and activated caspase 3, respectively. The effect of PPP on rat aortic SMC proliferation and apoptosis was studied in vitro by using cell counting, 3[H]-thymidine incorporation, and a flow cytometry assay for annexin V. Phosphorylation of the IGF-1 receptor, protein kinase B (Akt), and extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) in vitro and in vivo were analyzed by using Western blotting. RESULTS: PPP inhibited IGF-1-mediated SMC proliferation in vitro but no significant increase in apoptosis was detected. In rats treated with PPP, a more than a twofold reduction in carotid intima area was observed 2 weeks after balloon injury, a significant decrease in PCNA staining was demonstrated in early lesions, but activated caspase 3 was not detected. In addition, PPP attenuated phosphorylation of the IGF-1 receptor, Akt, and ERK1/2 in IGF-1-stimulated SMCs in vitro, and a reduced phosphorylation of the IGF-1 receptor and Akt was found in balloon-injured carotid arteries in rats treated with PPP. CONCLUSION: These results show that PPP potently blocks IGF-1-mediated phosphorylation of the IGF-1 receptor in SMCs, decreases downstream Akt and ERK1/2 activation, inhibits SMC replication, and subsequently attenuates intimal hyperplasia after balloon injury of rat carotid arteries.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Opicapone is a novel catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the tolerability, pharmacokinetics (including the effect of food) and pharmacodynamics (effect on COMT activity) following single oral doses of opicapone in young healthy male volunteers. METHODS: Single rising oral doses of opicapone (10, 25, 50, 100, 200, 400, 800 and 1,200 mg) were administered to eight groups of eight subjects per group (two subjects randomized to placebo and six subjects to opicapone), under a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled design. In an additional group of 12 subjects, a 50 mg single dose of opicapone was administered on two occasions, once having fasted overnight and once with a high-fat high-calorie meal. RESULTS: Opicapone was well tolerated at all doses tested. The extent of systemic exposure (area under the plasma concentration-time curve and maximum plasma concentration) to opicapone and metabolites increased in an approximately dose-proportional manner and showed a decrease following concomitant ingestion of a high-fat high-calorie meal. The apparent terminal elimination half-life of opicapone was 0.8-3.2 h. Sulphation appeared to be the main metabolic pathway for opicapone, and both opicapone and the main sulphated metabolite are likely excreted by the biliary route. Maximum COMT inhibition by opicapone was dose dependent, ranged from 36.1% (10 mg) to 100% (200 mg and above), and reached statistical significance at all doses tested. The long duration of COMT inhibition by opicapone, however, tended to be independent from the dose taken. The observed half-life of opicapone-induced COMT inhibition in human erythrocytes was 61.6 h (standard deviation [SD] = 37.6 h), which reflects an underlying dissociative process with a kinetic rate constant of 3.1 x 10(-6) s(-1) (SD = 1.9 x 10(-6) s(-1)). Such a process compares well to the estimated dissociation rate constant (k(off)) of the COMT-opicapone molecular complex (k(off) = 1.9 x 10(-6) s(-1)). CONCLUSIONS: Opicapone was well-tolerated and presented dose-proportional kinetics. Opicapone demonstrated marked and sustained inhibition of erythrocyte soluble COMT activity. Based on the observation that the half-life of COMT inhibition is independent of the dose and that it reflects an underlying kinetic process that is consistent with the k(off) value of the COMT-opicapone complex, we propose that the sustained COMT inhibition, far beyond the observable point of clearance of circulating drug, is due to the long residence time of the reversible complex formed between COMT and opicapone. Globally, these promising results provide a basis for further clinical development of opicapone.",

        "abstract": "As a continuation of our work with SB-277011A, we have examined the effects of another highly elective dopamine (DA) D3 receptor antagonist, N-(4-[4-{2,3-dichlorophenyl}-1-piperazinyl]butyl)-2-fluorenylcarboxamide (NGB 2904), in animal models of addiction. Our results indicate that by systemic administration, NGB 2904 inhibits intravenous cocaine self-administration maintained under a progressive-ratio (PR) reinforcement schedule, cocaine- or cocaine cue-induced reinstatement of cocaine-seeking behavior, and cocaine- or other addictive drug-enhanced brain stimulation reward (BSR). The action of NGB 2904 on PR cocaine self-administration was long-lasting (1-2 days) after a single injection, supporting its potential use in treatment of cocaine addiction. The effects of NGB 2904 in the BSR paradigm were dose-dependent for both NGB 2904 and cocaine; that is, only lower doses of NGB 2904 were effective, and their putative antiaddiction effect could be overcome by increasing the doses of cocaine or other addictive drugs. A dopamine-dependent mechanism is proposed to explain the effects of NGB 2904 on cocaine's actions in these animal models of drug addiction. The data reviewed in this paper suggest that NGB 2904 or other D3-selective antagonists may have potential in controlling motivation for drug-taking behavior or relapse to drug-seeking behavior, but may have a limited role in antagonizing the acute rewarding effects produced by cocaine or other addictive drugs. In addition, NGB 2904 may also act as a useful tool to study the role of D3 receptors in drug addiction.",

As expected based on the structure of the drug, it bound competitively with another two-metal binding inhibitor (Kd [binding constant], 6 +/- 4 nM). In a number of different cellular assays, GSK364735 inhibited HIV replication with potency at nanomolar concentrations (e.g., in peripheral blood mononuclear cells and MT-4 cells, 50% effective concentrations were 1.2 +/- 0.4 and 5 +/- 1 nM, respectively), with selectivity indexes of antiviral activity versus in-assay cytotoxicity of at least 2,200. When human serum was added, the antiviral potency decreased (e.g., a 35-fold decrease in the presence of 100% human serum was calculated by extrapolation from the results of the MT-4 cell assay). In cellular assays, GSK364735 blocked viral DNA integration, with a concomitant increase in two-long-terminal-repeat circles. As expected, this integrase inhibitor was equally active against wild-type viruses and mutant viruses resistant to approved drugs targeting either reverse transcriptase or protease. In contrast, some but not all viruses resistant to other integrase inhibitors were resistant to GSK364735. When virus was passaged in the presence of the inhibitor, we identified resistance mutations within the integrase active site that were the same as or similar to mutations arising in response to other two-metal binding inhibitors. Finally, either additive or synergistic effects were observed when GSK364735 was tested in combination with approved antiretrovirals (i.e., no antagonistic effects were seen). Thus, based on all the data, GSK364735 exerted potent antiviral activity through the inhibition of viral DNA integration by interacting at the two-metal binding site within the catalytic center of HIV integrase.",

        "abstract": "GPCRs (G-protein-coupled receptors) exist in a spontaneous equilibrium between active and inactive conformations that are stabilized by agonists and inverse agonists respectively. Because ligand binding of agonists and inverse agonists often occurs in a competitive manner, one can assume an overlap between both binding sites. Only a few studies report mutations in GPCRs that convert receptor blockers into agonists by unknown mechanisms. Taking advantage of a genetically modified yeast strain, we screened libraries of mutant M(3)Rs {M(3) mAChRs [muscarinic ACh (acetylcholine) receptors)]} and identified 13 mutants which could be activated by atropine (EC50 0.3-10 microM), an inverse agonist on wild-type M(3)R. Many of the mutations sensitizing M(3)R to atropine activation were located at the junction of intracellular loop 3 and helix 6, a region known to be involved in G-protein coupling. In addition to atropine, the pharmacological switch was found for other M(3)R blockers such as scopolamine, pirenzepine and oxybutynine. However, atropine functions as an agonist on the mutant M(3)R only when expressed in yeast, but not in mammalian COS-7 cells, although high-affinity ligand binding was comparable in both expression systems. Interestingly, we found that atropine still blocks carbachol-induced activation of the M(3)R mutants in the yeast expression system by binding at the high-affinity-binding site (Ki approximately 10 nM). Our results indicate that blocker-to-agonist converting mutations enable atropine to function as both agonist and antagonist by interaction with two functionally distinct binding sites.",

METHODS: In vitro antihistamine activity and selectivity of SUN-1334H was evaluated in a panel of receptor and enzyme assays and functional assays using isolated tissues. In vivo antihistamine and antiallergy efficacy were assessed following oral administration of SUN-1334H in histamine-induced bronchoconstriction in guinea pigs, skin wheal in beagle dogs and ovalbumin-induced rhinitis (sneezing, vascular permeability and intranasal pressure) in guinea pigs. Cardiovascular safety was assessed by CHO-K1/human ether-a-go-go related gene (hERG) K(+) current assay, dog telemetry and guinea-pig ECG. CNS safety was assessed by functional observational battery in rats and pentobarbital-induced sedation and pentylenetetrazol-induced convulsions in mice. The effect on intestinal motility was assessed in rats. RESULTS: In vitro receptor binding assays showed that SUN-1334H had high histamine H(1) receptor binding affinity with an inhibition constant value of 9.7 nmol/L and either no or insignificant affinity with a panel of receptors and enzymes. In functional assays, SUN-1334H caused potent inhibition of histamine-induced contractions of isolated guinea-pig ileum with an IC(50) (half the maximal inhibitory concentration) of 0.198 micromol/L. In contrast, SUN-1334H had no significant effect on isolated tissue contractions induced by cholinergic, H(2)-histaminergic, serotonergic, adrenergic receptor agonists or BaCl(2). In studies of animal models of histamine-mediated disorders, SUN-1334H potently inhibited histamine-induced bronchospasm over 24 hours following oral administration and completely suppressed histamine-induced skin wheal in beagle dogs and ovalbumin-induced rhinitis in guinea pigs. In CHO-K1/hERG cells, SUN-1334H did not modulate hERG K(+)-currents at concentrations as high as 100 micromol/L. Cardiovascular and CNS function and intestinal motility were not altered at doses several-fold greater than those required for efficacy, indicating a good safety profile of the drug.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Histamine H1-receptor antagonists are used to relieve the symptoms of an immediate allergic reaction. They have additional anti-inflammatory effects that could result from an inhibition of the transcription factors activator protein-1 (AP-1) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB). The implication of the H1-receptor in these effects is controversial. Diphenhydramine is a first-generation H1-receptor antagonist while mizolastine and desloratadine are second-generation compounds. Mizolastine is also an inhibitor of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO), an enzyme that has been involved in NF-kappaB activation. OBJECTIVE: We measured the ability of antihistamines to reverse histamine-induced smooth muscle contraction, an effect that involves the H1-receptor. We then investigated whether these drugs affect NF-kappaB and AP-1 activities in A549 lung epithelial cells, and whether this potential regulation involves H1-receptor and 5-LO. METHODS: Muscle tone was measured on tracheal segments of guinea-pigs. The H1-receptor was overexpressed by transfection and detected by Western blotting and immunofluorescence microscopy. NF-kappaB and AP-1 activities were assessed by reporter gene assays in cells overexpressing or not overexpressing the H1-receptor. Production of regulated upon activation, normal T cell expressed andsecreted (RANTES), a chemokine whose expression is induced through NF-kappaB, was measured using an immunoassay. RESULTS: H1-receptor antagonists reversed histamine-induced contraction in a dose-dependent manner. Induction of AP-1 and NF-kappaB activities by histamine and the down-regulatory effect of antihistamines required overexpression of the H1-receptor. In contrast, when tumour necrosis factor-alpha and a phorbol ester were used to stimulate NF-kappaB and AP-1 activities, respectively, repression of these activities did not involve the H1-receptor. Indeed, repression was triggered only by a subset of H1-receptor antagonists and was not stronger after overexpression of the H1-receptor. Mizolastine and desloratadine dose-dependently decreased tumour necrosis factor-alpha-induced production of RANTES. Diphenhydramine, H2- and H3-receptor antagonists as well as selective inhibitors of 5-LO were ineffective in this assay. CONCLUSION: Repression of NF-kappaB and AP-1 activities by H1-receptor antagonists involves H1-receptor-dependent and -independent mechanisms but not 5-LO.",

In vitro, MA-2029 (1 to 30 nM) competitively inhibited motilin-induced contractions in isolated rabbit duodenal longitudinal muscle strips, with a pA2 value of 9.17+/-0.01 (n=5). However, contractile responses to acetylcholine and substance P were unaffected even at 1 microM of MA-2029. MA-2029 concentration-dependently inhibited the binding of [125 I]motilin to motilin receptors in a homogenate of rabbit colon smooth muscle tissue and membranes of HEK 293 cells expressing human motilin receptors. The pKi of MA-2029 was 8.58+/-0.04 in the rabbit colon homogenate (n=4) and 8.39 in the HEK 293 cells (mean of duplicate experiments). In vivo, orally-administered MA-2029 (3 to 30 mg/kg) dose-dependently inhibited colonic contractions induced by motilin (3 microg/kg, i.v.) in conscious rabbits. Inhibition was caused by all doses at 30 min after administration and by 10 mg/kg or more at 4 h after administration. The plasma concentration of MA-2029 correlated with its inhibitory effect. Furthermore, the oral administration of MA-2029 (0.3 to 3 mg/kg) also inhibited abdominal muscle contractions (an index of the visceral pain) induced by intravenous infusion of motilin (3 microg/kg/h) during colorectal distension in conscious rabbits.

        "abstract": "An indole class of leukotriene synthesis inhibitors, exemplified by MK-886, which does not directly inhibit 5-lipoxygenase, has been shown to bind to an 18-kDa leukocyte membrane protein and to inhibit 5-lipoxygenase membrane translocation. It was demonstrated that the 18-kDa protein is necessary for the cellular activation of leukotriene synthesis and was named 5-lipoxygenase-activating protein (FLAP). We describe here a class of leukotriene synthesis inhibitors based on a quinoline structure, which is structurally distinct from MK-886. However, similar to MK-886, several quinolines are potent inhibitors of cellular leukotriene synthesis but are poor inhibitors of soluble 5-lipoxygenase. To determine whether FLAP is the protein target of leukotriene synthesis inhibitors of the quinoline class, we investigated the ability of these compounds to inhibit photoaffinity labeling of FLAP and to elute FLAP from indole affinity gels. The abilities of the quinoline inhibitors to interact with FLAP correlated well with their abilities to inhibit leukotriene synthesis in human polymorphonuclear leukocytes. L-674,573, a potent quinoline leukotriene synthesis inhibitor, inhibited indole photoaffinity labeling of FLAP in a concentration-dependent manner. In addition, L-674,573 selectively eluted FLAP from indole affinity gels, in contrast to L-671,480, a quinoline that was inactive as an inhibitor of leukotriene synthesis. When human leukocyte membranes were labeled with the indole photoaffinity probe [125I]L-669,083 and immunoprecipitated with a FLAP antibody, the labeling of FLAP was inhibited by L-674,573 but not by L-671,480.

Activation of metabotropic glutamate receptor 4 (mGluR4) has been shown to modulate neurotransmission in the basal ganglia and results in antiparkinsonian effects in rodent PD models. N-Phenyl-7-(hydroxyimino)cyclopropa[b]chromen-1a-carboxamide (PHCCC) is a positive allosteric modulator (PAM) of mGluR4 that has been used to further validate the role of mGluR4 in PD, but the compound suffers from a lack of selectivity, relatively low potency, and poor solubility. Via high-throughput screening, we discovered more than 400 novel PAMs of mGluR4. Compounds derived from a novel chemical scaffold were characterized in vitro at both rat and human mGluR4 using two distinct assays of mGluR4 function. The lead compound was approximately 8-fold more potent than PHCCC, enhanced the potency of glutamate at mGluR4 by 8-fold, and did not show any significant potentiator or antagonist activity at other mGluR subtypes. Resolution of the regioisomers of the lead revealed that the cis regioisomer, (+/-)-cis-2-(3,5-dichlorphenylcarbamoyl)cyclohexanecarboxylic acid (VU0155041), contained the majority of the mGluR4 PAM activity and also exhibited partial agonist activity at mGluR4 at a site that was distinct from the glutamate binding site, suggesting that this compound is a mixed allosteric agonist/PAM of mGluR4. VU0155041 was soluble in an aqueous vehicle, and intracerebroventricular administration of 31 to 316 nmol of VU0155041 dose-dependently decreased haloperidol-induced catalepsy and reserpine-induced akinesia in rats. These exciting results provide continued support for mGluR4 as a therapeutic target in PD.",

Recently, bis(1H-indol-2-yl)methanones were found to inhibit FLT3 and PDGFR kinases.

It can be difficult to assess the individual functions of each AGC kinase because their substrate specificities are similar. Here we describe the small molecule BI-D1870, which inhibits RSK1, RSK2, RSK3 and RSK4 in vitro with an IC(50) of 10-30 nM, but does not signi-ficantly inhibit ten other AGC kinase members and over 40 other protein kinases tested at 100-fold higher concentrations.

In contrast, BI-D1870 does not affect the agonist-triggered phosphorylation of substrates for six other AGC kinases. Moreover, BI-D1870 does not suppress the phorbol ester- or EGF-induced phosphorylation of CREB (cAMP-response-element-binding protein), consistent with the genetic evidence indicating that MSK, and not RSK, isoforms mediate the mitogen-induced phosphorylation of this transcription factor.",

Activators of these channels constitute useful pharmacological tools and potential new drugs for the treatment of ataxia, epilepsy, and hypertension. Here, we used the neuroprotectant riluzole as a template for the design of KCa2/3 channel activators that are potent enough for in vivo studies. Of a library of 41 benzothiazoles, we identified 2 compounds, anthra[2,1-d]thiazol-2-ylamine (SKA-20) and naphtho[1,2-d]thiazol-2-ylamine (SKA-31), which are 10 to 20 times more potent than riluzole and activate KCa2.1 with EC(50) values of 430 nM and 2.9 microM, KCa2.2 with an EC(50) value of 1.9 microM, KCa2.3 with EC(50) values of 1.2 and 2.9 microM, and KCa3.1 with EC(50) values of 115 and 260 nM. Likewise, SKA-20 and SKA-31 activated native KCa2.3 and KCa3.1 channels in murine endothelial cells, and the more \"drug-like\" SKA-31 (half-life of 12 h) potentiated endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor-mediated dilations of carotid arteries from KCa3.1(+/+) mice but not from KCa3.1(-/-) mice. Administration of 10 and 30 mg/kg SKA-31 lowered mean arterial blood pressure by 4 and 6 mm Hg in normotensive mice and by 12 mm Hg in angiotensin-II-induced hypertension. These effects were absent in KCa3.1-deficient mice. In conclusion, with SKA-31, we have designed a new pharmacological tool to define the functional role of the KCa2/3 channel activation in vivo. The blood pressure-lowering effect of SKA-31 suggests KCa3.1 channel activation as a new therapeutic principle for the treatment of hypertension.",

However, human immunodeficiency virus protease inhibitors (PIs) or non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) exert their action within the infected cell.

Therefore, for the quantification of nine PIs (amprenavir, atazanavir, darunavir, indinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, saquinavir and tipranavir), 1 active PI metabolite (nelfinavir M8) and 2 NNRTIs (efavirenz and nevirapine) in lysate of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) an assay was developed and validated, using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. Analytes were extracted from a PBMC pellet by means of a one-step extraction with 50% methanol containing the internal standards D6-indinavir, D5-saquinavir, 13C6-efavirenz and dibenzepine. Chromatographic separation was performed on a reversed phase C18 column (150mmx2.0mm, particle size 5microm) with a quick stepwise gradient using an acetate buffer (pH 5) and methanol, at a flow rate of 0.25mL/min. The analytical run time was 10min. The triple quadrupole mass spectrometer was operated in the positive ion-mode and multiple reaction monitoring was used for drug quantification. The method was validated over a range of 1-500ng/mL in PBMC lysate for all analytes. The method was proven to be specific, accurate, precise and robust. The mean precision and accuracy was less than +/-12% at all concentration levels. Using the developed assay and a previously developed assay for these analytes in plasma, the relationship between plasma and intracellular pharmacokinetics and their relationship with therapy outcome can now be determined.",

This process is regulated by type I and type II DNA topoisomerases that are targets for microbial antibiotics and/or anti-tumour drugs. Despite extensive studies in this field, no information is available on the response of Bacillus (B) species to eukaryotic DNA topoisomerase inhibitors. Here we found that B. thuringiensis BMG1.7 and HD9 strains are sensitive to DNA gyrase inhibitors (e.g. ciprofloxacin, novobiocin) and to etoposide VP16, a specific inhibitor of eukaryotic type II DNA topoisomerase. Inhibitory or sub-inhibitory concentrations of VP16 induced a drug-tolerant response: an immediate inhibition of growth, followed by a prolonged (10-12 h) lag in growth, and then resumption of normal growth subsequent to overnight culture. Inhibition of the DNA gyrase ATPase activity in B. subtillis 168 by novobiocin activated 80 genes and repressed 89 genes at 20 min after drug addition (P&lt;0.05). The altered genes belonged to various functional categories dominated by those whose products maintained DNA integrity, mediated transport of low molecular-weight compounds, and SOS response genes. Quantitative RT-PCR revealed comparable effects of novobiocin in B. subtillis and thuringiensis on gene expression. In contrast to novobiocin, VP16 treatment resulted in a moderate effect on gyrA, gyrB, and topA gene expression. However, dinB and lexA genes, involved in SOS response, displayed relatively high transcriptional levels compared to those seen in untreated cells. Furthermore, a small DNA plasmid isolated from novobicin-treated B. thuringiensis BMG 1.7 contained a ladder of partially relaxed topoisomers, while the electrophoretic mobility of its counterpart isolated from VP16-treated cells was unchanged. Collectively, the present study would assist in defining common and/or different pathways affected by eubacterial and eukaryotic type DNA topoisomerase inhibitors in the same living organism.",

We investigated cellular and molecular effects of the three substances relative to cytarabine in Kasumi-1 AML blasts.

The DNMT inhibitors showed no interference with cell-cycle progression whereas cytarabine treatment resulted in an S-phase arrest.

        "abstract": "Previous studies suggest that selective antagonists of specific subtypes of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) may provide a novel approach for the treatment of certain central nervous system (CNS) disorders, including epileptic disorders, Parkinson's disease, and dystonia. Unfortunately, previously reported antagonists are not highly selective for specific mAChR subtypes, making it difficult to definitively establish the functional roles and therapeutic potential for individual subtypes of this receptor subfamily. The M(1) mAChR is of particular interest as a potential target for treatment of CNS disorders. We now report the discovery of a novel selective antagonist of M(1) mAChRs, termed VU0255035 [N-(3-oxo-3-(4-(pyridine-4-yl)piperazin-1-yl)propyl)-benzo[c][1,2,5]thiadiazole-4 sulfonamide]. Equilibrium radioligand binding and functional studies demonstrate a greater than 75-fold selectivity of VU0255035 for M(1) mAChRs relative to M(2)-M(5). Molecular pharmacology and mutagenesis studies indicate that VU0255035 is a competitive orthosteric antagonist of M(1) mAChRs, a surprising finding given the high level of M(1) mAChR selectivity relative to other orthosteric antagonists. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings demonstrate that VU0255035 inhibits potentiation of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor currents by the muscarinic agonist carbachol in hippocampal pyramidal cells. VU0255035 has excellent brain penetration in vivo and is efficacious in reducing pilocarpine-induced seizures in mice. We were surprised to find that doses of VU0255035 that reduce pilocarpine-induced seizures do not induce deficits in contextual freezing, a measure of hippocampus-dependent learning that is disrupted by nonselective mAChR antagonists. Taken together, these data suggest that selective antagonists of M(1) mAChRs do not induce the severe cognitive deficits seen with nonselective mAChR antagonists and could provide a novel approach for the treatment certain of CNS disorders.",

        "abstract": "Recent studies have indicated that bone marrow angiogenesis is increased in multiple myeloma, suggesting that treatment with an antiangiogenic agent might be useful. Among the new antiangiogenic drugs in development, Neovastat (AE-941; Aeterna Laboratories, Quebec City, Canada) can be classified as a naturally occurring multifunctional antiangiogenic agent. It has a marked inhibitory effect on the formation of blood vessels in the chicken embryo vascularization assay (EVT) and endothelial cell proliferation. Furthermore, in vivo experiments showed that oral administration of Neovastat blocks the formation of blood vessels in Matrigel implants containing basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF). The antiangiogenic activity of Neovastat was found to be associated with two mechanisms of action. In addition to the inhibition of the matrix metalloproteinase activities (MMP-2, MMP-9, and MMP-12), Neovastat inhibits vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) binding to endothelial cells, VEGF-dependent tyrosine phosphorylation, and VEGF-induced vascular permeability in mice. Neovastat was also found to have a significant antitumor activity. Oral administration of Neovastat in mice with subcutaneous grafted breast cancer (DA3) cells showed a significant reduction in tumor volume. Neovastat also decreased the number of lung metastases in the Lewis lung carcinoma model. Interestingly, the effect of Neovastat was additive to cisplatin in this model. Furthermore, no treatment-related mortality or loss of body weight was observed. Also, toxicology studies in rats and monkeys demonstrate no dose-limiting toxicity or target organ damage after 1 year of chronic exposure, thus suggesting that Neovastat could be safely administered in humans. Four clinical studies have been conducted to establish the dosing, safety, and early efficacy of Neovastat administered orally. In the oncology field, 482 patients have received Neovastat, of which 146 with solid tumors were exposed to the drug for more than 6 months. Two phase III clinical trials are currently underway. A phase III double-blind placebo-controlled study is being conducted to evaluate the efficacy of Neovastat in addition to induction chemotherapy/radiotherapy combined modality treatment in patients with unresectable non-small cell lung cancer stage IIIA and IIIB. A second phase III randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled study evaluates the efficacy of Neovastat as a monotherapy in metastatic renal cell carcinoma patients who have progressed following a first-line immunotherapy. Neovastat efficacy is also being evaluated in a registration phase II trial in patients with early relapse or refractory multiple myeloma.",

        "abstract": "The receptor tyrosine kinase FLT3 is constitutively activated by an internal tandem duplication (ITD) mutation within the juxtamembrane domain in 20-30% of patients with acute myeloid leukemia. In this study, we identified GTP-14564 as a specific kinase inhibitor for ITD-FLT3 and investigated the molecular basis of its specificity. GTP-14564 inhibited the growth of interleukin-3-independent Ba/F3 expressing ITD-FLT3 at 1 microM, whereas a 30-fold higher concentration of GTP-14564 was required to inhibit FLT3 ligand-dependent growth of Ba/F3 expressing wild type FLT3 (wt-FLT3). However, this inhibitor suppressed the kinase activities of wt-FLT3 and ITD-FLT3 equally, suggesting that the signaling pathways for proliferation differ between wt-FLT3 and ITD-FLT3. Analysis of downstream targets of FLT3 using GTP-14564 revealed STAT5 activation to be essential for growth signaling of ITD-FLT3. In contrast, wt-FLT3 appeared to mainly use the MAPK pathway rather than the STAT5 pathway to transmit a proliferative signal. Further analysis demonstrated that the first two tyrosines in an ITD were critical for STAT5 activation and growth induction but that all of the tyrosines in the juxtamembrane region were dispensable in terms of the proliferation signals of wt-FLT3. These results indicate that an ITD mutation in FLT3 elicits an aberrant STAT5 activation that results in increased sensitivity to GTP-14564. Thus, FLT3-targeted inhibition is an attractive approach, with the potential for selective cytotoxicity, to the treatment of ITD-FLT3-positive acute myeloid leukemia.",

The present study is to isolate and identify the compounds that inhibit COX and 5-LOX, the key enzymes involved in inflammation and carcinogenesis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The ethanolic extract of the fruits was fractionated by RP-HPLC and fractions were tested for enzyme inhibition activity against COX and 5-LOX. One of the fractionated compounds showed potent dual inhibition against COX and 5-LOX. It was identified as chebulagic acid by LC-MS, NMR and IR analyses. The chebulagic acid was also tested for anti-proliferative activity. RESULTS: Chebulagic acid showed potent COX-LOX dual inhibition activity with IC(50) values of 15+/-0.288, 0.92+/-0.011 and 2.1+/-0.057 microM for COX-1, COX-2 and 5-LOX respectively. It also showed anti-proliferative activity against HCT-15, COLO-205, MDA-MB-231, DU-145 and K562 cell lines. Further mechanistic studies on COLO-205 cells revealed induction of apoptosis by chebulagic acid.

A novel inhibitor, Ro 28-2653, with high selectivity for MMP2, MMP9 and membrane type 1-MMP was evaluated in an orthotopic prostate cancer rat model. Efficacy was determined by recording tumor growth and survival endpoints. Prostate cancer was induced by inoculating R3327 Dunning tumor cells (MatLyLu) into the ventral lobe of the prostates of 148 Copenhagen rats. Daily oral treatment with Ro 28-2653 (10-300 mg/kg per day) was started on day 1 or on day 6 after tumor cell injection. Animals were sacrificed on day 20 for determination of tumor weights. For survival studies, rats received daily oral Ro 28-2653 (100 mg/kg per day) or vehicle for up to 30 days. Tumor induction was successful in 100% of the animals. Ro 28-2653 reproducibly reduced the tumor weights by up to 90% in a dose-dependent manner. In addition, an inhibitory effect in rats with established tumors (treatment start at day 6) was shown.

        "abstract": "The inhibitors of monoamine oxidase B (MAO B) are effectively used as therapeutic drugs for neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative diseases. However, their mechanism of action is not clear, since the neuroprotective effect of MAO B inhibitors is associated with the blockage of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH)-death cascade, rather than the inhibition of MAO B. Here, we provide evidence that GAPDH potentiates the ethanol-induced activity of MAO B and brain cell toxicity. The levels of nuclear GAPDH and MAO B activity are significantly increased in brain-derived cell lines upon 75 mM ethanol-induced cell death. Over-expression of GAPDH in cells enhances ethanol-induced cell death, and also increases the ethanol-induced activation of MAO B. In contrast, the MAO B inhibitors rasagiline and selegiline (0.25 nM) and the rasagiline metabolite, 1-R-aminoindan (1 muM) decreases the ethanol-induced MAO B, prevents nuclear translocation of GAPDH and reduces cell death. In addition, GAPDH interacts with transforming growth factor-beta-inducible early gene (TIEG2), a transcriptional activator for MAO B, and this interaction is increased in the nucleus by ethanol but reduced by MAO B inhibitors and 1-R-aminoindan. Furthermore, silencing TIEG2 using RNAi significantly reduces GAPDH-induced MAO B upregulation and neurotoxicity. In summary, ethanol-induced cell death, attenuated by MAO B inhibitors, may result from disrupting the movement of GAPDH with the transcriptional activator into the nucleus and secondly inhibit MAO B gene expression. Thus, the neuroprotective effects of rasagiline or 1-R-aminoindan on ethanol-induced cell death mediated by a novel GAPDH-MAO B pathway may provide a new insight in the treatment of neurobiological diseases including alcohol-use disorders.",

Their activities against Plasmodium falciparum in the infected erythrocyte assay were largely different from those against the target enzyme.

        "abstract": "Neointima formation participates in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis and restenosis. Proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) are initial responses to vascular injury. The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of gliotoxin, an inhibitor of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB, on migration and proliferation of cultured rat VSMC and neointimal formation in injured rat vessels. In cultured VSMC, gliotoxin inhibited the nuclear translocation of the p65 subunit of NF-kappaB in response to inflammatory stimuli. In addition, gliotoxin inhibited VSMC migration and proliferation in response to platelet-derived growth factor-BB. This was associated with a rapid rearrangement of the F-actin and vimentin cytoskeleton. Furthermore, gliotoxin inhibited endothelial cell nuclear translocation of p65, cell surface expression of adhesion molecules such as VCAM-1, ICAM-1 and E-selectin, and monocytic cell adhesion to a cytokine-activated endothelial monolayer. In the rat carotid artery balloon catheter injury model, the systemic administration of gliotoxin for 10 days decreased neointimal hyperplasia and luminal stenosis by up to 90% and decreased the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen in the vessel wall by up to 70%, depending on the dose. These observations suggest that gliotoxin favorably regulates the response to vascular injury through actions on VSMC.

At room temperature (RT), methacholine (MCh) or 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) induced Ca(2+) oscillations and an associated contraction in small airway SMCs. The subsequent exposure to an IP(3)R antagonist, 2-aminoethoxydiphenyl borate (2-APB), inhibited the Ca(2+) oscillations and induced airway relaxation in a concentration-dependent manner. 2-APB also inhibited Ca(2+) waves generated by the photolytic release of IP(3). However, the RyR antagonist ryanodine had no significant effect, at any concentration, on airway contraction or agonist- or IP(3)-induced Ca(2+) oscillations or Ca(2+) wave propagation. By contrast, a second RyR antagonist, tetracaine, relaxed agonist-contracted airways and inhibited agonist-induced Ca(2+) oscillations in a concentration-dependent manner. However, tetracaine did not affect IP(3)-induced Ca(2+) release or wave propagation nor the Ca(2+) content of SMC Ca(2+) stores as evaluated by Ca(2+)-release induced by caffeine. Conversely, both ryanodine and tetracaine completely blocked agonist-independent slow Ca(2+) oscillations induced by KCl. The inhibitory effects of 2-APB and absence of an effect of ryanodine on MCh-induced airway contraction or Ca(2+) oscillations of SMCs were also observed at 37 degrees C. In Ca(2+)-permeable SMCs, tetracaine inhibited agonist-induced contraction without affecting intracellular Ca(2+) levels indicating that relaxation also resulted from a reduction in Ca(2+) sensitivity. These results indicate that agonist-induced Ca(2+) oscillations in mouse small airway SMCs are primary mediated via IP(3)Rs and that tetracaine induces relaxation by both decreasing Ca(2+) sensitivity and inhibiting agonist-induced Ca(2+) oscillations via an IP(3)-dependent mechanism.",

In this study, we report the discovery of 3-nitro-N-(4-phenoxyphenyl) benzamide (ICA-105574), a potent and efficacious hERG channel activator with a unique mechanism of action. In whole-cell patch-clamp studies of recombinant hERG channels, ICA-105574 steeply potentiated current amplitudes more than 10-fold with an EC(50) value of 0.5 +/- 0.1 microM and a Hill slope (n(H)) of 3.3 +/- 0.2. The effect on hERG channels was confirmed because the known hERG channel blockers, N-[4-[[1-[2-(6-methyl-2-pyridinyl)ethyl]-4-piperidinyl]carbonyl]phenyl]methanesulfonamide, 2HCl (E-4031) and BeKm-1, potently blocked the stimulatory effects of ICA-105574. The primary mechanism by which ICA-105574 potentiates hERG channel activity is by removing hERG channel inactivation, because ICA-105574 (2 microM) shifts the midpoint of the voltage-dependence of inactivation by &gt;180 mV from -86 to +96 mV. In addition to the effects on inactivation, greater concentrations of ICA-105574 (3 microM) produced comparatively small hyperpolarizing shifts (up to 11 mV) in the voltage-dependence of channel activation and a 2-fold slowing of channel deactivation. In isolated guinea pig ventricular cardiac myocytes, ICA-105574 induced a concentration-dependent shortening of action potential duration (&gt;70%, 3 microM) that could be prevented by preincubation with E-4031. In conclusion, we identified a novel agent that can prevent the inactivation of hERG potassium channels.

CX157 (3-fluoro-7-(2,2,2-trifluoroethoxy)phenoxathiin-10,10-dioxide) is a RIMA, which is currently in development for the treatment of major depressive disorder. We examined the degree and reversibility of the inhibition of brain monoamine oxidase-A (MAO-A) and plasma CX157 levels at different times after oral dosing to establish a dosing paradigm for future clinical efficacy studies, and to determine whether plasma CX157 levels reflect the degree of brain MAO-A inhibition. Brain MAO-A levels were measured with positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and [(11)C]clorgyline in 15 normal men after oral dosing of CX157 (20-80 mg). PET imaging was conducted after single and repeated doses of CX157 over a 24-h time course. We found that 60 and 80 mg doses of CX157 produced a robust dose-related inhibition (47-72%) of [(11)C]clorgyline binding to brain MAO-A at 2 h after administration and that brain MAO-A recovered completely by 24 h post drug. Plasma CX157 concentration was highly correlated with the inhibition of brain MAO-A (EC(50): 19.3 ng/ml). Thus, CX157 is the first agent in the RIMA class with documented reversible inhibition of human brain MAO-A, supporting its classification as a RIMA, and the first RIMA with observed plasma levels that can serve as a biomarker for the degree of brain MAO-A inhibition.

Collectively, these enzymes are capable of degrading all components of the extracellular matrix, and they play an important role in normal physiologic conditions, such as wound healing and other processes involving tissue remodeling. However, increased activity of these enzymes now has been observed in a number of different pathological conditions, and it has been hypothesized that such increased activity of MMPs might play a role in the pathogenesis of these conditions. Cancer is one such condition; extracellular matrices constitute the principal barrier to tumor growth and spread, and there is growing experimental evidence that malignant tumors utilize MMPs to overcome these barriers. Consequently, inhibitors of MMPs represent an attractive target for a new class of anticancer agents. Marimastat and batimastat are potent broad-spectrum inhibitors of all major MMPs and have been shown to prevent or reduce spread and growth of a number of different malignant tumors in numerous animal models.

        "abstract": "Nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) are employed in first line therapies for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. They generally lack a 3'-hydroxyl group, and thus when incorporated into the nascent DNA they prevent further elongation. In this report we show that 4'-ethynyl-2-fluoro-2'-deoxyadenosine (EFdA), a nucleoside analog that retains a 3'-hydroxyl moiety, inhibited HIV-1 replication in activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells with an EC(50) of 0.05 nm, a potency several orders of magnitude better than any of the current clinically used NRTIs. This exceptional antiviral activity stems in part from a mechanism of action that is different from approved NRTIs. Reverse transcriptase (RT) can use EFdA-5'-triphosphate (EFdA-TP) as a substrate more efficiently than the natural substrate, dATP. Importantly, despite the presence of a 3'-hydroxyl, the incorporated EFdA monophosphate (EFdA-MP) acted mainly as a de facto terminator of further RT-catalyzed DNA synthesis because of the difficulty of RT translocation on the nucleic acid primer possessing 3'-terminal EFdA-MP. EFdA-TP is thus a translocation-defective RT inhibitor (TDRTI). This diminished translocation kept the primer 3'-terminal EFdA-MP ideally located to undergo phosphorolytic excision. However, net phosphorolysis was not substantially increased, because of the apparently facile reincorporation of the newly excised EFdA-TP. Our molecular modeling studies suggest that the 4'-ethynyl fits into a hydrophobic pocket defined by RT residues Ala-114, Tyr-115, Phe-160, and Met-184 and the aliphatic chain of Asp-185. These interactions, which contribute to both enhanced RT utilization of EFdA-TP and difficulty in the translocation of 3'-terminal EFdA-MP primers, underlie the mechanism of action of this potent antiviral nucleoside.",

        "abstract": "Evidence implicates anandamide in dopamine-related cocaine function. In the present study, we investigated the effect of methanandamide (5 mg/kg, i.p.), a stable anandamide analog, on the hyperthermia and hyperactivity induced by a fixed dose of cocaine (15 mg/kg,i.p.). Cocaine administered to rats produced hyperthermia and hyperactivity whereas methanandamide was ineffective. For combined administration, methanandamide attenuated the hyperthermia, but not hyperactivity, induced by cocaine. The effect of methanandamide was abolished by pretreatment with a cannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonist, SR141716A (5 mg/kg, i.p.), or dopamine D2 receptor antagonist, S(-)-raclopride(5 mg/kg, i.p.) but not by capsazepine (40 mg/kg, i.p.), a transient receptor potential vanilloid 1 cation channel antagonist. Methanandamide also attenuated the hyperthermia caused by a dopamine D1 receptor agonist, SKF 38393 (10 mg/kg, s.c.), indicating that it reduces hyperthermia produced by dopamine D1 receptor activation. URB597 (0.25 mg/kg, i.p.), an inhibitor of anandamide metabolism, did not alter cocaine-induced hyperthermia. Our results demonstrate that methanandamide activates cannabinoid CB1 receptors to attenuate cocaine-induced hyperthermia, and that dopamine D2 receptor activation plays a permissive role in the thermoregulatory effects of methanandamide.",

In this study the leaves of the anti-diabetic medicinal plant loquat (Eriobotrya japonica) were phytochemically investigated following hints from a pharmacophore-based virtual screening and a bioactivity-guided approach. Determination of the 11beta-HSD1 and 11beta-HSD2 inhibitory activities in cell lysates revealed triterpenes from the ursane type as selective, low micro-molar inhibitors of 11beta-HSD1, that is, corosolic acid (1), 3-epicorosolic acid methyl ester (4), 2-alpha hydroxy-3-oxo urs-12-en-28-oic acid (6), tormentic acid methyl ester (8), and ursolic acid (9). Importantly, a mixture of loquat constituents with moderate activities displayed a pronounced additive effect. By means of molecular modeling studies and the identification of the 11beta-HSD1-inhibiting 11-keto-ursolic acid (17) and 3-acetyl-11-keto-ursolic acid (18) a structure-activity relationship was deduced for this group of pentacyclic triterpenes.

Therefore, molecules that restore sensitivity to death receptor stimuli would be important tools to better understand this biological pathway and potential leads for therapeutic adjuncts. Previously, the small-molecule 4-(4-chloro-2-methylphenoxy)-N-hydroxybutanamide (that we propose be named droxinostat) was identified as a chemical sensitizer to death receptor stimuli, decreasing the expression of the caspase-8 inhibitor FLIP. However, the direct targets of droxinostat were unknown. To better understand the mechanism of action of droxinostat and highlight new strategies to restore sensitivity to death receptor ligands, we analyzed changes in gene expression using the Connectivity Map after treating cells with droxinostat. Changes in gene expression after droxinostat treatment resembled changes observed after treatment with histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors. Therefore, we examined the effects of droxinostat on HDAC activity and showed that it selectively inhibited HDAC3, HDAC6, and HDAC8 and that inhibition of these HDACs was functionally important for its ability to sensitize cells to death ligands. Thus, we have identified a selective HDAC inhibitor and showed that selective HDAC inhibition sensitizes cells to death ligands, thereby highlighting a new mechanism to overcome resistance to death receptor ligands.",

Their actions are mediated by CysLT(1) and CysLT(2) receptors. Here we report the discovery of 3-({[(1S,3S)-3-carboxycyclohexyl]amino}carbonyl)-4-(3-{4-[4-(cyclo-hexyloxy)butoxy]phenyl}propoxy) benzoic acid (HAMI3379), the first potent and selective CysLT(2) receptor antagonist. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Pharmacological characterization of HAMI3379 was performed using stably transfected CysLT(1) and CysLT(2) receptor cell lines, and isolated, Langendorff-perfused, guinea pig hearts. KEY RESULTS: In a CysLT(2) receptor reporter cell line, HAMI3379 antagonized leukotriene D(4)- (LTD(4)-) and leukotriene C(4)- (LTC(4)-) induced intracellular calcium mobilization with IC(50) values of 3.8 nM and 4.4 nM respectively. In contrast, HAMI3379 exhibited very low potency on a recombinant CysLT(1) receptor cell line (IC(50) &gt; 10 000 nM). In addition, HAMI3379 did not exhibit any agonistic activity on both CysLT receptor cell lines. In binding studies using membranes from the CysLT(2) and CysLT(1) receptor cell lines, HAMI3379 inhibited [(3)H]-LTD(4) binding with IC(50) values of 38 nM and &gt;10 000 nM respectively. In isolated Langendorff-perfused guinea pig hearts HAMI3379 concentration-dependently inhibited and reversed the LTC(4)-induced perfusion pressure increase and contractility decrease. The selective CysLT(1) receptor antagonist zafirlukast was found to be inactive in this experimental setting. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: HAMI3379 was identified as a potent and selective CysLT(2) receptor antagonist, which was devoid of CysLT receptor agonism. Using this compound, we showed that the cardiac effects of CysLTs are predominantly mediated by the CysLT(2) receptor.",

        "abstract": "FMS-like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) inhibitors have shown activity in the treatment of acute myelogenous leukemia (AML). Secondary mutations in target kinases can cause clinical resistance to therapeutic kinase inhibition. We have previously shown that sensitivity toward tyrosine kinase inhibitors varies between different activating FLT3 mutations. We therefore intended to determine whether different FLT3 inhibitors would produce distinct profiles of secondary, FLT3 resistance mutations. Using a cell-based screening approach, we generated FLT3-internal tandem duplication (ITD)-expressing cell lines resistant to the FLT3 inhibitors SU5614, PKC412, and sorafenib. Interestingly, the profile of resistance mutations emerging with SU5614 was limited to exchanges in the second part of the kinase domain (TK2) with exchanges of D835 predominating. In contrast, PKC412 exclusively produced mutations within tyrosine kinase domain 1 (TK1) at position N676. A mutation at N676 recently has been reported in a case of PKC412-resistant AML. TK1 mutations exhibited a differential response to SU5614, sorafenib, and sunitinib but strongly impaired response to PKC412. TK2 exchanges identified with SU5614 were sensitive to PKC412, sunitinib, or sorafenib, with the exception of Y842D, which caused a strong resistance to sorafenib. Of note, sorafenib also produced a highly distinct profile of resistance mutations with no overlap to SU5614 or PKC412, including F691L in TK1 and exchanges at position Y842 of TK2. Thus, different FLT3 kinase inhibitors generate distinct, nonoverlapping resistance profiles. This is in contrast to Bcr-Abl kinase inhibitors such as imatinib, nilotinib, and dasatinib, which display overlapping resistance profiles. Therefore, combinations of FLT3 inhibitors may be useful to prevent FLT3 resistance mutations in the setting of FLT3-ITD-positive AML.",

        "abstract": "AIMS: In this study, we investigated whether the opioid system and the nitric oxide pathway were involved in the peripheral antinociception induced by a cannabinoid receptor agonist anandamide. MAIN METHODS: Hyperalgesia was induced by a subcutaneous injection of carrageenan (250 microg) into the plantar surface of the rat's hindpaw and measured by the paw pressure test 3h after injection. The weight in grams (g) required to elicit a nociceptive response, paw flexion, was determined as the nociceptive threshold. KEY FINDINGS: Anandamide elicited a dose-dependent (50, 75, and 100 ng per paw) antinociceptive effect. The highest dose of anandamide did not produce antihyperalgesia in the contralateral paw, indicating a peripheral site of action. The CB(1) receptor antagonist AM251 (20, 40, 80 and 160mug per paw) antagonized peripheral antihyperalgesia induced by anandamide (100 ng), in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting CB(1) receptor activation. Anandamide-induced peripheral antihyperalgesia was reverted by blockers of the l-arginine/NO/cGMP pathway N(G)-nitro-l-arginine (NOARG; 24, 36 and 48 microg per paw) and 1H-[1,2,4] Oxadiazolo[4,3-a]quinoxalin-1-one (ODQ; 25, 50 and 100 microg per paw), in a dose-dependent manner. Furthermore, opioid receptor antagonist naloxone (12.5, 25 and 50 microg per paw) antagonized the peripheral antihyperalgesia induced by anandamide.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB is a transcription factor that regulates cytokine and chemokine production in various inflammatory diseases, including bronchial asthma. IkappaB kinase (IKK) beta is important for NF-kappaB activation in inflammatory conditions, and is possibly related to airway remodelling. Thus, inhibition of the IKKbeta-NF-kappaB pathway may be an ideal strategy for the management of airway remodelling. OBJECTIVE: We examined the effects of a newly synthesized IKKbeta inhibitor, IMD-0354, in a chronic allergen exposure model of bronchial asthma in mice. METHODS: A chronic mouse model was generated by challenge with house dust mite antigen (Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus). IMD-0354 was administrated intraperitoneally in therapeutic groups. Lung histopathology, hyperresponsiveness and the concentrations of mediators and molecules in supernatants of lung homogenates were determined. RESULTS: NF-kappaB activation was inhibited by prolonged periods of IMD-0354 administration. IMD-0354 reduced the numbers of bronchial eosinophils. IMD-0354 also inhibited the pathological features of airway remodelling, including goblet cell hyperplasia, subepithelial fibrosis, collagen deposition and smooth muscle hypertrophy. Inhibition of these structural changes by IMD-0354 was the result of the suppressing the production and activation of remodelling-related mediators, such as TGF-beta, via inhibition of IKKbeta. IMD-0354 inhibited IL-13 and IL-1beta production, and it restored the production of IFN-gamma. It also ameliorated airway hyperresponsiveness. CONCLUSION: IKKbeta plays crucial roles in airway inflammation and remodelling in a chronic mouse model of asthma. A specific IKKbeta inhibitor, IMD-0354, may be therapeutically beneficial for treating airway inflammation and remodelling in chronic asthma.",

        "title": "Selective inhibition of casein kinase 1 epsilon minimally alters circadian clock period.",
        "abstract": "The circadian clock links our daily cycles of sleep and activity to the external environment. Deregulation of the clock is implicated in a number of human disorders, including depression, seasonal affective disorder, and metabolic disorders. Casein kinase 1 epsilon (CK1epsilon) and casein kinase 1 delta (CK1delta) are closely related Ser-Thr protein kinases that serve as key clock regulators as demonstrated by mammalian mutations in each that dramatically alter the circadian period. Therefore, inhibitors of CK1delta/epsilon may have utility in treating circadian disorders. Although we previously demonstrated that a pan-CK1delta/epsilon inhibitor, 4-[3-cyclohexyl-5-(4-fluoro-phenyl)-3H-imidazol-4-yl]-pyrimidin-2-ylamine (PF-670462), causes a significant phase delay in animal models of circadian rhythm, it remains unclear whether one of the kinases has a predominant role in regulating the circadian clock. To test this, we have characterized 3-(3-chloro-phenoxymethyl)-1-(tetrahydro-pyran-4-yl)-1H-pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidin-4-ylamine (PF-4800567), a novel and potent inhibitor of CK1epsilon (IC(50) = 32 nM) with greater than 20-fold selectivity over CK1delta. PF-4800567 completely blocks CK1epsilon-mediated PER3 nuclear localization and PER2 degradation. In cycling Rat1 fibroblasts and a mouse model of circadian rhythm, however, PF-4800567 has only a minimal effect on the circadian clock at concentrations substantially over its CK1epsilon IC(50). This is in contrast to the pan-CK1delta/epsilon inhibitor PF-670462 that robustly alters the circadian clock under similar conditions. These data indicate that CK1epsilon is not the predominant mediator of circadian timing relative to CK1delta. PF-4800567 should prove useful in probing unique roles between these two kinases in multiple signaling pathways.",

Computational docking experiments guided design and synthesis efforts with analogues of 4-PI. In particular, three interactions of 4-PI analogues with IDO were studied: the active site entrance, the interior of the active site, and the heme iron binding. The three most potent inhibitors (1, 17, and 18) appear to exploit interactions with C129 and S167 in the interior of the active site. All three inhibitors are approximately 10-fold more potent than 4-PI.

OBJECTIVE: The present study characterized the effects of a novel, selective, and brain penetrant H(3) receptor antagonist (JNJ-39220675) on the reinforcing effects of alcohol in rats. METHODS: The effect of JNJ-39220675 on alcohol intake and alcohol relapse-like behavior was evaluated in selectively bred alcohol-preferring (P) rats using the standard two-bottle choice method. The compound was also tested on operant alcohol self administration in non-dependent rats and on alcohol-induced ataxia using the rotarod apparatus. In addition, alcohol-induced dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens was tested in freely moving rats. RESULTS: Subcutaneous administration of the selective H(3) receptor antagonist dose-dependently reduced both alcohol intake and preference in alcohol-preferring rats. JNJ-39220675 also reduced alcohol preference in the same strain of rats following a 3-day alcohol deprivation. The compound significantly and dose-dependently reduced alcohol self-administration without changing saccharin self-administration in alcohol non-dependent rats. Furthermore, the compound did not change the ataxic effects of alcohol, alcohol elimination rate, nor alcohol-induced dopamine release in nucleus accumbens. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that blockade of H(3) receptor should be considered as a new attractive mechanism for the treatment of alcoholism.",

        "abstract": "Checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1) is an essential serine/threonine kinase that responds to DNA damage and stalled DNA replication. CHK1 is essential for maintenance of replication fork viability during exposure to DNA antimetabolites. In human tumor cell lines, ablation of CHK1 function during antimetabolite exposure led to accumulation of double-strand DNA breaks and cell death. Here, we extend these observations and confirm ablation of CHK2 does not contribute to these phenotypes and may diminish them. Furthermore, concomitant suppression of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) activity is sufficient to completely antagonize the desired CHK1 ablation phenotypes. These mechanism-based observations prompted the development of a high-content, cell-based screen for gamma-H2AX induction, a surrogate marker for double-strand DNA breaks. This mechanism-based functional approach was used to optimize small molecule inhibitors of CHK1. Specifically, the assay was used to mechanistically define the optimal in-cell profile with compounds exhibiting varying degrees of CHK1, CHK2, and CDK selectivity. Using this approach, SCH 900776 was identified as a highly potent and functionally optimal CHK1 inhibitor with minimal intrinsic antagonistic properties. SCH 900776 exposure phenocopies short interfering RNA-mediated CHK1 ablation and interacts synergistically with DNA antimetabolite agents in vitro and in vivo to selectively induce dsDNA breaks and cell death in tumor cell backgrounds.",

Previous studies demonstrated that the non-peptide molecule SHA 68 acts as a selective NPSR antagonist. In the present study the pharmacological profile of SHA 68 has been further investigated in vitro and in vivo. In cells expressing the mouse NPSR SHA 68 was inactive per se up to 10microM while it antagonized NPS-stimulated calcium mobilization in a competitive manner showing a pA(2) value of 8.06. In the 10-50mg/kg range of doses, SHA 68 counteracted the stimulant effects elicited by NPS, but not those of caffeine, in mouse locomotor activity experiments. In the mouse righting reflex assay SHA 68 fully prevented the arousal-promoting action of the peptide. The anxiolytic-like effects of NPS were slightly reduced by SHA 68 in the mouse open field, fully prevented in the rat elevated plus maze and partially antagonized in the rat defensive burying paradigm. Finally, SHA 68 was found poorly active in antagonizing the NPS inhibitory effect on palatable food intake in rats. In all assays SHA 68 did not produce any effect per se. In conclusion, the present study demonstrated that SHA 68 behaves as a selective NPSR antagonist that can be used to characterize the in vivo actions of NPS.

Screening of a small molecule compound library with a beta-galactosidase fragment complementation assay measuring beta-catenin nuclear entry revealed TAK-715 and AMG-548 as inhibitors of Wnt-3a-stimulated beta-catenin signaling. TAK-715 and AMG-548 are inhibitors of p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase, which has been suggested to regulate activation of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling. However, two highly selective and equally potent p38 inhibitors, VX-745 and Scio-469, did not inhibit Wnt-3a-stimulated beta-catenin signaling. Profiling of TAK-715 and AMG-548 against a panel of over 200 kinases revealed cross-reactivity with casein kinase Idelta and e, which are known activators of Wnt/beta-catenin signaling.

This report describes the bone marrow colony-forming unit, granulocyte macrophage (CFU-GM) and tumor cell CFU activity of topoisomerase I (Top1) inhibitors, such as Genz-644282, topotecan, irinotecan/SN-38, and ARC-111, and examines their activity in several human tumor xenograft models. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Colony-forming assays were conducted with mouse and human bone marrow and eight human tumor cell lines. In addition, 29 human tumor cell lines representing a range of histology and potential resistance mechanisms were assayed for sensitivity to Genz-644282 in a 72-hour exposure assay. The efficacy of Genz-644282 was compared with standard anticancer drugs (i.e., irinotecan, docetaxel, and dacarbazine) in human tumor xenografts of colon cancer, renal cell carcinoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and melanoma. RESULTS: Human bone marrow CFU-GM was more sensitive to the Top1 inhibitors than was mouse bone marrow CFU-GM. The ratio of mouse to human IC(90) values was more than 10 for the camptothecins and less than 10 for Genz-644282, which had more potency as a cytotoxic agent toward human tumor cells in culture than the camptothecins in the colony-forming and 72-hour proliferation assays. Genz-644282 has superior or equal antitumor activity in the human tumor xenografts than the standard drug comparators.

A physiological role played by PAT2 in amino acid reabsorption in the renal proximal tubule is demonstrated by mutations in SLC36A2 that lead to an iminoglycinuric phenotype (imino acid and glycine uria) in humans. A number of proline, GABA and tryptophan derivatives were examined to determine if they function either as transported substrates or non-transported inhibitors of PAT2. The compounds were investigated following heterologous expression of rat PAT2 in Xenopus laevis oocytes. PAT2 function was characterised by: radiotracer uptake and competition (cis-inhibition) studies; radiotracer efflux and trans-stimulation; and measurement of substrate-induced positive inward current by two-electrode voltage-clamp. In general, the proline derivatives appeared to be transported substrates and the relative ability to induce current flow was closely related to the inhibitory effects on PAT2-mediated l-[(3)H]proline uptake. In contrast, certain heterocyclic GABA derivatives (e.g. l-pipecolic acid) were translocated only slowly. Finally, the tryptophan derivatives inhibited PAT2 function but did not undergo transport. l-Proline uptake was inhibited by 5-hydroxy-l-tryptophan (IC(50) 1.6+-0.4mM), alpha-methyl-d,l-tryptophan (3.5+-1.5mM), l-tryptophan, 1-methyl-l-tryptophan and indole-3-propionic acid. Although neither 5-hydroxy-l-tryptophan nor alpha-methyl-d,l-tryptophan were able to elicit inward current in PAT2-expressing oocytes both reduced the current evoked by l-proline. 5-Hydroxy-l-tryptophan and alpha-methyl-d,l-tryptophan were unable to trans-stimulate l-proline efflux from PAT2-expressing oocytes, confirming that the two compounds act as non-transported blockers of PAT2. These two tryptophan derivatives should prove valuable experimental tools in future investigations of the physiological roles of PAT2.",

To decipher the brain functions of TAAR1, a selective TAAR1 agonist, RO5166017, was engineered. RO5166017 showed high affinity and potent functional activity at mouse, rat, cynomolgus monkey, and human TAAR1 stably expressed in HEK293 cells as well as high selectivity vs. other targets. In mouse brain slices, RO5166017 inhibited the firing frequency of dopaminergic and serotonergic neurons in regions where Taar1 is expressed (i.e., the ventral tegmental area and dorsal raphe nucleus, respectively). In contrast, RO5166017 did not change the firing frequency of noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus, an area devoid of Taar1 expression. Furthermore, modulation of TAAR1 activity altered the desensitization rate and agonist potency at 5-HT(1A) receptors in the dorsal raphe, suggesting that TAAR1 modulates not only dopaminergic but also serotonergic neurotransmission. In WT but not Taar1(-/-) mice, RO5166017 prevented stress-induced hyperthermia and blocked dopamine-dependent hyperlocomotion in cocaine-treated and dopamine transporter knockout mice as well as hyperactivity induced by an NMDA antagonist.

PKC-iota confers resistance to drug-induced apoptosis in cancer cells. The acquisition of drug resistance is a major obstacle to good prognosis in neuroblastoma. The focus of this research was to identify the efficacy of [4-(5-amino-4-carbamoylimidazol-1-yl)-2,3-dihydroxycyclopentyl] methyl dihydrogen phosphate (ICA-1) as a novel PKC-iota inhibitor in neuroblastoma cell proliferation and apoptosis. ICA-1 specifically inhibits the activity of PKC-iota but not that of PKC-zeta (PKC-zeta), the closely related atypical PKC family member. The IC(50) for the kinase activity assay was approximately 0.1muM which is 1000 times less than that of aurothiomalate, a known PKC-iota inhibitor. Cyclin dependent kinase 7 (Cdk7) phosphorylates cyclin dependent kinases (cdks) and promotes cell proliferation. Our data shows that PKC-iota is an in vitro Cdk7 kinase and the phosphorylation of Cdk7 by PKC-iota was potently inhibited by ICA-1. Furthermore, our data shows that neuroblastoma cells proliferate via a PKC-iota/Cdk7/cdk2 cell signaling pathway and ICA-1 mediates its antiproliferative effects by inhibiting this pathway. ICA-1 (0.1muM) inhibited the in vitro proliferation of BE(2)-C neuroblastoma cells by 58% (P=0.01). Additionally, ICA-1 also induced apoptosis in neuroblastoma cells. Interestingly, ICA-1 did not affect the proliferation of normal neuronal cells suggesting its potential as chemotherapeutic with low toxicity.

        "abstract": "Modulators of metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 5 (mGluR5) may provide novel treatments for multiple central nervous system (CNS) disorders, including anxiety and schizophrenia. Although compounds have been developed to better understand the physiological roles of mGluR5 and potential usefulness for the treatment of these disorders, there are limitations in the tools available, including poor selectivity, low potency, and limited solubility. To address these issues, we developed an innovative assay that allows simultaneous screening for mGluR5 agonists, antagonists, and potentiators. We identified multiple scaffolds that possess diverse modes of activity at mGluR5, including both positive and negative allosteric modulators (PAMs and NAMs, respectively). 3-Fluoro-5-(3-(pyridine-2-yl)-1,2,4-oxadiazol-5-yl)benzonitrile (VU0285683) was developed as a novel selective mGluR5 NAM with high affinity for the 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)-pyridine (MPEP) binding site. VU0285683 had anxiolytic-like activity in two rodent models for anxiety but did not potentiate phencyclidine-induced hyperlocomotor activity. (4-Hydroxypiperidin-1-yl)(4-phenylethynyl)phenyl)methanone (VU0092273) was identified as a novel mGluR5 PAM that also binds to the MPEP site. VU0092273 was chemically optimized to an orally active analog, N-cyclobutyl-6-((3-fluorophenyl)ethynyl)nicotinamide hydrochloride (VU0360172), which is selective for mGluR5. This novel mGluR5 PAM produced a dose-dependent reversal of amphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion, a rodent model predictive of antipsychotic activity. Discovery of structurally and functionally diverse allosteric modulators of mGluR5 that demonstrate in vivo efficacy in rodent models of anxiety and antipsychotic activity provide further support for the tremendous diversity of chemical scaffolds and modes of efficacy of mGluR5 ligands. In addition, these studies provide strong support for the hypothesis that multiple structurally distinct mGluR5 modulators have robust activity in animal models that predict efficacy in the treatment of CNS disorders.",

Here we report the in vitro and in vivo characterization of CPPZ (1-(4-(2-chloro-4-fluorophenyl)piperazin-1-yl)-2-(pyridin-4-ylmethoxy)ethanone), a structurally novel positive allosteric modulator selective for mGlu(5) receptor. In HEK293 cells stably over-expressing human mGlu(5) receptor, CPPZ potentiates the intracellular calcium response elicited by a suboptimal concentration of the endogenous agonist glutamate. CPPZ does not have any intrinsic agonist activity and behaves functionally as a positive allosteric modulator. This is further supported by binding data, which demonstrate that CPPZ is able to displace the negative allosteric modulator MPEP but does not compete with the orthosteric ligand quisqualic acid. Instead, CPPZ enhances the binding of the orthosteric ligand. In native preparations, CPPZ potentiates calcium flux in rat cortical neurons stimulated with the group I agonist dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG). In addition, CPPZ modulates long-term potentiation in rat hippocampal slices, a process known to be NMDA dependent. In vivo, CPPZ reverses hyper locomotion triggered by the NMDA open channel blocker MK801 in CD1 mice. CPPZ was also able to reduce rat conditioned avoidance responding to electric shock. Both in vitro and in vivo data demonstrate that this novel compound acts as an mGlu(5) receptor positive allosteric modulator, which modulates NMDA dependent responses and suggests that the enhancement of mGlu(5) receptor activity may prove useful in the treatment of schizophrenia.",

        "abstract": "Cyclin-dependent kinases (CDK) play a crucial role in the control of the cell cycle. Aberrations in the control of cell cycle progression occur in the majority of human malignancies; hence, CDKs are promising targets for anticancer therapy. Here, we define the cellular effects of the novel CDK inhibitor NU6140, alone or in association with paclitaxel, with respect to inhibition of cell proliferation and cell cycle progression and induction of apoptosis in HeLa cervical carcinoma cells and in comparison with purvalanol A. Both CDK inhibitors induced a concentration-dependent cell cycle arrest at the G(2)-M phase and an increase in the apoptotic rate, with a concomitant down-regulation of the antiapoptotic protein survivin, a member of the inhibitors of apoptosis protein family. Notably, the addition of NU6140 to paclitaxel-treated cells resulted in markedly increased cytotoxic effect and apoptotic response in comparison with the paclitaxel-purvalanol A combination (86 +/- 11% and 37 +/- 8%, respectively). Similarly, the extent of caspase-9 and caspase-3 activation in paclitaxel-NU6140-treated cells was approximately 4-fold higher than after the paclitaxel-purvalanol A combination. Moreover, an almost complete abrogation of the expression of the active, Thr(34)-phosphorylated form of survivin was observed in cells exposed to the paclitaxel-NU6140 combination. A synergistic effect of the paclitaxel-NU6140 combination, as a consequence of survivin inhibition and increased activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3, was also observed in OAW42/e ovarian cancer line but not in the derived OAW42/Surv subline ectopically expressing survivin. Results from this study indicate that NU6140 significantly potentiates the apoptotic effect of paclitaxel, with inhibition of survivin expression/phosphorylation as the potential mechanism.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Altered glutamatergic neurotransmission is linked to several neurological and psychiatric disorders. Metabotropic glutamate receptor 2 (mGlu2) plays an important role on the presynaptic control of glutamate release and negative allosteric modulators (NAMs) acting on mGlu2/3 receptors are under assessment for their potential as antidepressants, neurogenics and cognitive enhancers. Two new potent mGlu2/3 NAMs, RO4988546 and RO5488608, are described in this study and the allosteric binding site in the transmembrane (TM) domain of mGlu2 is characterized. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Site directed mutagenesis, functional measurements and beta2-adrenoceptor-based modelling of mGlu2 were employed to identify important molecular determinants of two new potent mGlu2/3 NAMs. KEY RESULTS: RO4988546 and RO5488608 affected both [3H]-LY354740 agonist binding at the orthosteric site and the binding of a tritiated positive allosteric modulator (3H-PAM), indicating that NAMs and PAMs could have overlapping binding sites in the mGlu2 TM domain. We identified eight residues in the allosteric binding pocket that are crucial for non-competitive antagonism of agonist-dependent activation of mGlu2 and directly interact with the NAMs: Arg3 28, Arg3 29, Phe3 36, His(E2.52) , Leu5 43, Trp6 48, Phe6 55 and Val7 43. The mGlu2 specific residue His(E2.52) is likely to be involved in selectivity and residues located in the outer part of the binding pocket are more important for [3H]-LY354740 agonist binding inhibition, which is independent of the highly conserved Trp6 48 residue. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: This is the first complete molecular investigation of the allosteric binding pocket of mGlu2 and Group II mGluRs and provides new information on what determines mGlu2 NAMs selective interactions and effects.",

The first H4R ligands were non-selective compounds, but intensive chemical and pharmacological work has led to the discovery of highly potent and selective H4R antagonists (e.g. JNJ7777120, CZC-13788, PF-2988403, A-940894, A-987306).

        "abstract": "Tideglusib is a GSK-3 inhibitor currently in phase II clinical trials for the treatment of Alzheimer disease and progressive supranuclear palsy. Sustained oral administration of the compound to a variety of animal models decreases Tau hyperphosphorylation, lowers brain amyloid plaque load, improves learning and memory, and prevents neuronal loss. We report here that tideglusib inhibits GSK-3beta irreversibly, as demonstrated by the lack of recovery in enzyme function after the unbound drug has been removed from the reaction medium and the fact that its dissociation rate constant is non-significantly different from zero. Such irreversibility may explain the non-competitive inhibition pattern with respect to ATP shown by tideglusib and perhaps other structurally related compounds. The replacement of Cys-199 by an Ala residue in the enzyme seems to increase the dissociation rate, although the drug retains its inhibitory activity with decreased potency and long residence time. In addition, tideglusib failed to inhibit a series of kinases that contain a Cys homologous to Cys-199 in their active site, suggesting that its inhibition of GSK-3beta obeys to a specific mechanism and is not a consequence of nonspecific reactivity. Results obtained with [(35)S]tideglusib do not support unequivocally the existence of a covalent bond between the drug and GSK-3beta. The irreversibility of the inhibition and the very low protein turnover rate observed for the enzyme are particularly relevant from a pharmacological perspective and could have significant implications on its therapeutic potential.",

        "abstract": "Despite the recent successes in producing orexin receptor subtype-selective antagonists, these are not commonly available, and therefore, agonist ligands are regularly used to ascribe cell and tissue responses to OX(1) or OX(2) receptors. In the current study, we have compared the native \"subtype-selective\" agonist, orexin-B, and its reputedly enhanced synthetic variant, Ala(11), d-Leu(15)-orexin-B, in two different recombinant cell lines. Ca2+ elevation was used as readout, and the two \"selective\" ligands were compared to the subtype-non-selective orexin-A, as is customary with these ligands. In transiently transfected HEK-293 cells, orexin-B showed 9-fold selectivity for the OX(2) receptor and Ala(11), d-Leu(15)-orexin-B 23-fold selectivity, when the potency ratios of ligands were compared between OX(1) and OX(2). In stable CHO-K1 cells, the corresponding values were only 2.6- and 14-fold, respectively. In addition to being low, the selectivity of the ligands was also variable, as indicated by the comparison of the two cell lines. For instance, the relative potency of Ala(11), d-Leu(15)-orexin-B at OX(2) in CHO cells was only 2.3-fold higher than its relative potency at OX(1) in HEK-293 cells; this indicates that Ala(11), d-Leu(15)-orexin-B does not show high enough selectivity for OX(2) to be useful for determination of receptor subtype expression. Comparison of the potencies of orexin-A and -B with respect to a number of published responses in OX(1)-expressing CHO cells, demonstrates that these show great variation: i.e., orexin-A is 1.6-18-fold more potent than orexin-B, depending on the response assessed. These data together suggest that orexin receptor ligands show signal trafficking, which makes agonist-based pharmacology unreliable.",

        "abstract": "Here we report the discovery of ON044580, an alpha-benzoyl styryl benzyl sulfide that possesses potent inhibitory activity against two unrelated kinases, JAK2 and BCR-ABL, and exhibits cytotoxicity to human tumor cells derived from chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and myelodysplasia (MDS) patients or cells harboring a mutant JAK2 kinase. This novel spectrum of activity is explained by the non-ATP-competitive inhibition of JAK2 and BCR-ABL kinases. ON044580 inhibits mutant JAK2 kinase and the proliferation of JAK2(V617F)-positive leukemic cells and blocks the IL-3-mediated phosphorylation of JAK2 and STAT5. Interestingly, this compound also directly inhibits the kinase activity of both wild-type and imatinib-resistant (T315I) forms of the BCR-ABL kinase. Finally, ON044580 effectively induces apoptosis of imatinib-resistant CML patient cells. The apparently unrelated JAK2 and BCR-ABL kinases share a common substrate, STAT5, and such substrate competitive inhibitors represent an alternative therapeutic strategy for development of new inhibitors. The novel mechanism of kinase inhibition exhibited by ON044580 renders it effective against mutant forms of kinases such as the BCR-ABL(T315I) and JAK2(V617F). Importantly, ON044580 selectively reduces the number of aneuploid cells in primary bone marrow samples from monosomy 7 MDS patients, suggesting another regulatory cascade amenable to this agent in these aberrant cells. Data presented suggest that this compound could have multiple therapeutic applications including monosomy 7 MDS, imatinib-resistant CML, and myeloproliferative neoplasms that develop resistance to ATP-competitive agents.",

The renin-angiotensin system negatively regulates the transforming growth factor-beta signaling pathway, which plays a major role in tissue fibrosis. To investigate the anti-EPS effect of renin-angiotensin system inhibition, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, quinapril, was administered to an EPS model in mice.

Colony-stimulating factor-1 (CSF-1) is expressed by many tumors and is a growth factor for macrophages and mediates osteoclast differentiation. Herein, we report the efficacy of a novel orally active CSF-1 receptor (CSF-1R) kinase inhibitor, JNJ-28312141, in proof of concept studies of solid tumor growth and tumor-induced bone erosion. H460 lung adenocarcinoma cells did not express CSF-1R and were not growth inhibited by JNJ-28312141 in vitro. Nevertheless, daily p.o. administration of JNJ-28312141 caused dose-dependent suppression of H460 tumor growth in nude mice that correlated with marked reductions in F4/80(+) tumor-associated macrophages and with increased plasma CSF-1, a possible biomarker of CSF-1R inhibition. Furthermore, the tumor microvasculature was reduced in JNJ-28312141-treated mice, consistent with a role for macrophages in tumor angiogenesis. In separate studies, JNJ-28312141 was compared with zoledronate in a model in which MRMT-1 mammary carcinoma cells inoculated into the tibias of rats led to severe cortical and trabecular bone lesions. Both agents reduced tumor growth and preserved bone. However, JNJ-28312141 reduced the number of tumor-associated osteoclasts superior to zoledronate. JNJ-28312141 exhibited additional activity against FMS-related receptor tyrosine kinase-3 (FLT3). To more fully define the therapeutic potential of this new agent, JNJ-28312141 was evaluated in a FLT3-dependent acute myeloid leukemia tumor xenograft model and caused tumor regression.

A large number of kinase inhibitors are therefore currently under investigation in clinical trials, and so far seven inhibitors have been approved as anti-cancer drugs. In addition, kinase inhibitors are widely used as specific probes to study cell signaling, but systematic studies describing selectivity of these reagents across a panel of diverse kinases are largely lacking. Here we evaluated the specificity of 156 validated kinase inhibitors, including inhibitors used in clinical trials, against 60 human Ser/Thr kinases using a thermal stability shift assay. Our analysis revealed many unexpected cross-reactivities for inhibitors thought to be specific for certain targets. We also found that certain combinations of active-site residues in the ATP-binding site correlated with the detected ligand promiscuity and that some kinases are highly sensitive to inhibition using diverse chemotypes, suggesting them as preferred intervention points. Our results uncovered also inhibitor cross-reactivities that may lead to alternate clinical applications. For example, LY333'531, a PKCbeta inhibitor currently in phase III clinical trials, efficiently inhibited PIM1 kinase in our screen, a suggested target for treatment of leukemia. We determined the binding mode of this inhibitor by x-ray crystallography and in addition showed that LY333'531 induced cell death and significantly suppressed growth of leukemic cells from acute myeloid leukemia patients.",

Antidiabetic effects of DA-1229 in HF-DIO mice and young db/db mice. KEY FINDINGS: DA-1229 was shown to potently inhibit the DPP4 enzyme in human and murine soluble forms and the human membrane-bound form with IC(50) values of 0.98, 3.59 and 1.26 nM, respectively. As a reversible and competitive inhibitor, DA-1229 was more selective to human DPP4 (6000-fold) than to human DPP8 and DPP9. DA-1229 (0.1-3mg/kg) dose-dependently inhibited plasma DPP4 activity, leading to increased levels of plasma GLP-1 and insulin, and thereby lowering blood glucose levels in mice. In high fat diet-fed (HF) mice, a single oral dose of 100mg/kg of DA-1229 reduced plasma DPP4 activity by over 80% during a 24h period. Long-term treatment with DA-1229 for 8 weeks revealed significant improvements in glucose intolerance and insulin resistance, accompanied by significant body weight reduction. However, it remains unclear whether there is a direct causal relationship between DPP4 inhibition and body weight reduction. In young db/db mice, the DA-1229 treatment significantly reduced blood glucose excursions for the first 2 weeks, resulting in significantly lower levels of HbA1c at the end of the study. Furthermore, the pancreatic insulin content of the treatment group was significantly higher than that of the db/db control.

Spantide II, an undecapeptide, has a total of seven substitutions in the sequence of substance P, consisting of two natural L amino acids, and one unnatural L amino acid, and four unnatural D amino acids. The pi- and sigma-bond amino acid substituents of substance P and spantide II are compared toward a future understanding of the essential substituents for mechanism and inhibition binding. Spantide II has five pi-bond and six sigma-bond amino acid moieties, and substance P has two pi-bond and nine sigma-bond moieties.",

        "abstract": "S6K1 (p70 ribosomal S6 kinase 1) is activated by insulin and growth factors via the PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase) and mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) signalling pathways. S6K1 regulates numerous processes, such as protein synthesis, growth, proliferation and longevity, and its inhibition has been proposed as a strategy for the treatment of cancer and insulin resistance. In the present paper we describe a novel cell-permeable inhibitor of S6K1, PF-4708671, which specifically inhibits the S6K1 isoform with a Ki of 20 nM and IC50 of 160 nM. PF-4708671 prevents the S6K1-mediated phosphorylation of S6 protein in response to IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor 1), while having no effect upon the PMA-induced phosphorylation of substrates of the highly related RSK (p90 ribosomal S6 kinase) and MSK (mitogen- and stress-activated kinase) kinases. PF-4708671 was also found to induce phosphorylation of the T-loop and hydrophobic motif of S6K1, an effect that is dependent upon mTORC1 (mTOR complex 1). PF-4708671 is the first S6K1-specific inhibitor to be reported and will be a useful tool for delineating S6K1-specific roles downstream of mTOR.",

        "abstract": "The antipsychotic drug zotepine [ZTP; 2-[(8-chlorodibenzo[b,f]thiepin-10-yl)oxy]-N,N-dimethylethan-1-amine] is known to have not only atypical antipsychotic effects but also antidepressive effects in schizophrenia patients. Norzotepine [norZTP; N-desmethylzotepine, 2-[(8-chlorodibenzo[b,f]thiepin-10-yl)oxy]-N-methylethan-1-amine] has been postulated to be a major metabolite of ZTP in humans. Here, we characterized norZTP through several in vitro studies and in animal models of psychosis, depression, and extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS) and compared the pharmacological profiles with those of ZTP. Although both compounds showed similar overall neurotransmitter receptor binding profiles, norZTP showed 7- to 16-fold more potent norepinephrine reuptake inhibition than ZTP. In a pharmacokinetic study, both ZTP and norZTP showed good brain permeability when administered individually in mice, although norZTP was not detected in either plasma or brain after intraperitoneal injection of ZTP. In the methamphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion test in mice, norZTP and ZTP showed similar antipsychotic-like effects at doses above 1 mg/kg i.p. In contrast, unlike ZTP, norZTP did not induce catalepsy up to 10 mg/kg i.p. norZTP significantly antagonized the hypothermia induced by reserpine [(3beta,16beta,17alpha,18beta,20alpha)-11,17-dimethoxy-18-[(3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoyl)oxy]yohimban-16-carboxylic acid methyl ester], suggesting in vivo inhibition of the norepinephrine transporter. In the forced-swim test, norZTP exerted an antidepressant-like effect at the effective doses for its antipsychotic action, whereas ZTP neither antagonized reserpine-induced hypothermia nor showed antidepressant-like effect. These results collectively demonstrate that norZTP exerts more potent inhibitory action than ZTP on norepinephrine transporters both in vitro and in vivo, presumably accounting for its antidepressant-like effect and low EPS propensity. Given that norZTP is the major metabolite observed in humans, norZTP may contribute to the unique clinical profiles of its mother compound, ZTP.",

Administration of GDC-0834 (30-100 mg/kg) in a rat collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) model resulted in a dose-dependent decrease of ankle swelling and reduction of morphologic pathology. An integrated disease progression pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic model where efficacy is driven by pBTK inhibition was fit to ankle-diameter time-course data. This model incorporated a transit model to characterize nondrug-related decreases in ankle swelling occurring at later stages of disease progression in CIA rats. The time course of ankle swelling in vehicle animals was described well by the base model. Simultaneous fitting of data from vehicle- and GDC-0834-treated groups showed that overall 73% inhibition of pBTK was needed to decrease the rate constant describing the ankle swelling increase (k(in)) by half. These findings suggest a high degree of pBTK inhibition is required for maximal activity of the pathway on inflammatory arthritis in rats.",

        "abstract": "The interaction of the ubiquitous Na(+)/H(+) exchanger, NHE1, with its commonly used inhibitors, amiloride- and benzoylguanidine (Hoechst type inhibitor (HOE))-type compounds, is incompletely understood. We previously cloned NHE1 from Amphiuma tridactylum (AtNHE1) and Pleuronectes americanus (PaNHE1). Although highly homologous to the amiloride- and HOE-sensitive human NHE1 (hNHE1), AtNHE1 is insensitive to HOE-type and PaNHE1 to both amiloride- and HOE-type compounds. Here we generated chimeras to \"knock in\" amiloride and HOE sensitivity to PaNHE1, and we thereby identified several NHE1 regions involved in inhibitor interaction. The markedly different inhibitor sensitivities of hNHE1, AtNHE1, and PaNHE1 could not be accounted for by differences in transmembrane (TM) region 9. Replacing TM10 through the C-terminal tail of PaNHE1 with the corresponding region of AtNHE1 partially restored sensitivity to amiloride and the related compound 5'-(N-ethyl-N-isopropyl)amiloride (EIPA) but not to HOE694. This effect was not due to the tail region, but it was dependent on TM10-11, because replacing only this region with that of AtNHE1 also partially restored amiloride and EIPA but not HOE sensitivity. The converse mutant (TM10-11 of AtNHE1 replaced with those of PaNHE1) exhibited even higher amiloride and EIPA sensitivity and was also HOE-sensitive. Replacing an LFFFY motif in TM region 4 of PaNHE1 with the corresponding residues of hNHE1 (VFFLF) or AtNHE1 (TFFLF) greatly increased sensitivity to both amiloride- and HOE-type compounds, despite the fact that AtNHE1 is HOE694-insensitive. Gain of amiloride sensitivity appeared to correlate with increased Na(+)/H(+) exchange rates. It is concluded that regions within TM4 and TM10-11 contribute to amiloride and HOE sensitivity, with both regions imparting partial inhibitor sensitivity to NHE1.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Poly(ADP-ribose) is synthesized from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) and degraded by poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG). The activation of the PARP/PARG pathway has been found in a variety of animal models of diseases, including septic shock-like syndrome. We have previously demonstrated that PARP inhibition by 3-ami-nobenzamide or GPI 6150 ameliorates multiple organ dysfunctions induced by zymosan. In the present study, we investigated whether similar effect could be achieved through PARG inhibition to break the cycle of poly(ADP-ribose) turnaround. DESIGN: Experimental study. SETTING: University laboratory. SUBJECTS: Male CD mice (20-22 g). INTERVENTIONS: We tested the effects of GPI 18214 (40 mg/kg intraperitoneally bolus), a novel and potent PARG inhibitor, at 1 and 6 hr after zymosan (500 mg/kg, administered intraperitoneally as a suspension in saline) on the development of septic shock-like syndrome in mice. Organ failure and systemic inflammation in mice were assessed 18 hrs after administration of zymosan and/or GPI 18214 and monitored for 12 days (for loss of body weight and mortality). MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: At 18 hrs after zymosan administration, we found a significant increase of peritoneal exudates, leukocyte infiltration in peritoneal cavity as well as an infiltration of neutrophils in lung and ileum tissues and subsequent lipid peroxidation, and increased production of plasma tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interleukin-1 beta. Furthermore, zymosan administration induced significant liver, lung, pancreas, intestine, and kidney dysfunction as well as a systemic toxicity and significant loss of body weight. At the end of observation period (12 days), 90% of zymosan-treated mice were dead. GPI 18214 (40 mg/kg intraperitoneally, 1 and 6 hrs after zymosan) treatment significantly reduced peritoneal exudates, inflammatory cell infiltration, and organ injury and mortality rate in zymosan-treated mice. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports early studies that show efficacy from blocking the poly(ADP-ribose) pathway in septic shock-like syndrome model. It provides evidence that GPI 18214, a PARG inhibitor, attenuates the degree of zymosan-induced nonseptic shock in mice, suggesting that PARG may be an alternative therapeutic target for shock treatment.",

        "abstract": "Recurrent chromosomal translocations involving the mixed lineage leukaemia (MLL) gene initiate aggressive forms of leukaemia, which are often refractory to conventional therapies. Many MLL-fusion partners are members of the super elongation complex (SEC), a critical regulator of transcriptional elongation, suggesting that aberrant control of this process has an important role in leukaemia induction. Here we use a global proteomic strategy to demonstrate that MLL fusions, as part of SEC and the polymerase-associated factor complex (PAFc), are associated with the BET family of acetyl-lysine recognizing, chromatin 'adaptor' proteins. These data provided the basis for therapeutic intervention in MLL-fusion leukaemia, via the displacement of the BET family of proteins from chromatin. We show that a novel small molecule inhibitor of the BET family, GSK1210151A (I-BET151), has profound efficacy against human and murine MLL-fusion leukaemic cell lines, through the induction of early cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. I-BET151 treatment in two human leukaemia cell lines with different MLL fusions alters the expression of a common set of genes whose function may account for these phenotypic changes. The mode of action of I-BET151 is, at least in part, due to the inhibition of transcription at key genes (BCL2, C-MYC and CDK6) through the displacement of BRD3/4, PAFc and SEC components from chromatin. In vivo studies indicate that I-BET151 has significant therapeutic value, providing survival benefit in two distinct mouse models of murine MLL-AF9 and human MLL-AF4 leukaemia. Finally, the efficacy of I-BET151 against human leukaemia stem cells is demonstrated, providing further evidence of its potent therapeutic potential. These findings establish the displacement of BET proteins from chromatin as a promising epigenetic therapy for these aggressive leukaemias.",

        "abstract": "The in vivo selectivity of the novel delta opioid-receptor antagonist N,N-bisallyl-Tyr-Gly-Gly-psi-(CH2S)-Phe-Leu-OH (ICI 154129) was examined in several opioid-selective models. Antagonism at the delta receptor was demonstrated in the striatal head-turn model in the rat. Intrapallidal injection of the relatively selective delta-receptor agonist D-Ala2,D-Leu5-enkephalin (0.5 micrograms) slowed the head-turn time and this effect was completely prevented by prior subcutaneous administration of ICI 154129 (30 mg/kg). The role of delta receptors in two classical test situations was studied using the mixed opioid agonist etorphine and the antagonists naloxone and ICI 154129. The drug ICI 154129 (30 mg/kg, s.c.) failed to prevent the antinociceptive effects and stimulation of locomotor activity produced by etorphine, whereas the relatively selective mu-opioid receptor antagonist, naloxone was effective in both test situations. The possible involvement of delta receptors in morphine-induced dependence was studied by monitoring the abstinence behaviour precipitated in rats given pellets of morphine by either ICI 154129 or naloxone. Naloxone (0.5 mg/kg, i.p.) precipitated a characteristic withdrawal syndrome in conscious rats and, at a much smaller dose (0.02 mg/kg, i.p.), induced shaking behaviour in pentobarbitone-anaesthetised rats. No withdrawal signs were observed in either model after injection of ICI 154129 (30 mg/kg, s.c.), suggesting that the delta receptors are not involved in dependence on morphine.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: We previously found focal adhesion kinase (FAK) inhibition sensitizes ovarian cancer to taxanes; however, the mechanisms are not well understood. METHODS: We characterized the biologic response of taxane-resistant and taxane-sensitive ovarian cancer models to a novel FAK inhibitor (VS-6063). We used reverse-phase protein arrays (RPPA) to identify novel downstream targets in taxane-resistant cell lines. Furthermore, we correlated clinical and pathological data with nuclear and cytoplasmic expression of FAK and YB-1 in 105 ovarian cancer samples. Statistical tests were two-sided, and P values were calculated with Student t test or Fisher exact test. RESULTS: We found that VS-6063 inhibited FAK phosphorylation at the Tyr397 site in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The combination of VS-6063 and paclitaxel markedly decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis, which resulted in 92.7% to 97.9% reductions in tumor weight. RPPA data showed that VS-6063 reduced levels of AKT and YB-1 in taxane-resistant cell lines. FAK inhibition enhanced chemosensitivity in taxane-resistant cells by decreasing YB-1 phosphorylation and subsequently CD44 in an AKT-dependent manner. In human ovarian cancer samples, nuclear FAK expression was associated with increased nuclear YB-1 expression (chi2) = 37.7; P &lt; .001). Coexpression of nuclear FAK and YB-1 was associated with statistically significantly worse median overall survival (24.9 vs 67.3 months; hazard ratio = 2.64; 95% confidence interval = 1.38 to 5.05; P = .006). CONCLUSIONS: We have identified a novel pathway whereby FAK inhibition with VS-6063 overcomes YB-1-mediated paclitaxel resistance by an AKT-dependent pathway. These findings have implications for clinical trials aimed at targeting FAK.",

The half-lives of 4 and 5 for conversion into the parent amino acids were determined under approximate physiological conditions in the presence or absence of human serum. Under the former conditions the half-lives for 4 and 5 were 6.3 hr and 0.8 hr, and, in the absence of serum, 15.5 hr and 1.2 hr, respectively. The compounds 4 and 5 were administered intracerebroventricularly (i.c.v.) or intraperitoneally (i.p.) to DBA/2 mice and their effects on audiogenic seizures determined. In agreement with earlier findings for 5, all phases of the seizure response of the animals were suppressed by compound 4 at doses above 2mmol/kg i.p. At anticonvulsant doses of compound 4, as well as of 5, side effects such as sedation and impairments of motor activities were observed. The ethyl and pivaloyloxymethyl esters 9 and 11 of cis-4-acetoxynipecotic acid, designed as 'double' ester prodrugs of the GABA uptake inhibitor cis-4-OH-nipecotic acid, were synthesized and shown to have very weak anticonvulsant effects. Compounds 9 and 11 did, however, show a broad spectrum of cholinergic side effects. These apparent interactions of 9 and 11 with muscarinic cholinergic receptors have been explained on the basis of the similarity of the structures of 9 and 11 to that of the muscarinic agonist 1-methyl-4-acetoxypiperidine. Furthermore, the structural similarity of 9 and the muscarinic agonist nipecotic acid ethyl ester may, to some extent, underlie the cholinergic profile of 9.",

Phylogenetic analysis of its 16S rRNA gene sequence indicated that it is 4.5% divergent from the type strain for Symploca and thus is likely a new genus. Fractionation of the crude extract led to the isolation of a new cytotoxin, designated santacruzamate A (1), which has several structural features in common with suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid [(2), SAHA, trade name Vorinostat], a clinically approved histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor used to treat refractory cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Recognition of the structural similarly of 1 and SAHA led to the characterization of santacruzamate A as a picomolar level selective inhibitor of HDAC2, a Class I HDAC, with relatively little inhibition of HDAC4 or HDAC6, both Class II HDACs. As a result, chemical syntheses of santacruzamate A as well as a structurally intriguing hybrid molecule, which blends aspects of both agents (1 and 2), were achieved and evaluated for their HDAC activity and specificity.",

        "abstract": "Oncogenic BRAF, which drives cell transformation and proliferation, has been detected in approximately 50% of human malignant melanomas and 5% to 15% of colorectal cancers. Despite the remarkable clinical activities achieved by vemurafenib and dabrafenib in treating BRAF(V600E) metastatic melanoma, their clinical efficacy in BRAF(V600E) colorectal cancer is far less impressive. Prior studies suggested that feedback activation of EGFR and MAPK signaling upon BRAF inhibition might contribute to the relative unresponsiveness of colorectal cancer to the first-generation BRAF inhibitors. Here, we report characterization of a dual RAF kinase/EGFR inhibitor, BGB-283, which is currently under clinical investigation. In vitro, BGB-283 potently inhibits BRAF(V600E)-activated ERK phosphorylation and cell proliferation. It demonstrates selective cytotoxicity and preferentially inhibits proliferation of cancer cells harboring BRAF(V600E) and EGFR mutation/amplification. In BRAF(V600E) colorectal cancer cell lines, BGB-283 effectively inhibits the reactivation of EGFR and EGFR-mediated cell proliferation. In vivo, BGB-283 treatment leads to dose-dependent tumor growth inhibition accompanied by partial and complete tumor regressions in both cell line-derived and primary human colorectal tumor xenografts bearing BRAF(V600E) mutation.

        "abstract": "The human oxytocin (OT) receptor was stably expressed in 293 embryonic kidney cells (293/OTR), characterized pharmacologically and compared to human uterine myometrial receptors. The cloned receptor is expressed at a reasonably high density (0.82 fmole/microgram protein) and exhibits high affinity for [3H]OT (Kd = 0.32nM), similar to the value found in human myometrial tissue. The rank-order of potency for various antagonist and agonist ligands from several structural classes is also similar between the cloned and native receptor, as seen in a comparison of their inhibitory constants for [3H]OT binding. Agonist affinity at the cloned OT receptor is decreased by guanine nucleotide analogs, demonstrating functional G-protein-coupling. The OT receptor in 293 cells, like in human myometrium, is also coupled to the inositol phosphate pathway. In 293/OTR cells, OT stimulates inositol phosphate accumulation with an EC50 = 4.1 nM, an effect blocked by a potent and selective OT antagonist, L-366,948. Additionally, the cloned receptor in 293 cells desensitizes to high concentrations of OT, similar to the desensitization in myometrial tissue and also described for several other G-protein-coupled receptors.

Its activity during metastasis may be regulated by an inhibitor, PAI-1. Previous work has shown that high levels of uPA and PAI-1 are associated with poor prognosis in primary breast cancers. PURPOSE: In this pilot study, we explored possible associations between the expression levels of uPA or PAI-1 and the efficacy of tamoxifen treatment in breast cancer patients with relapsed disease. METHODS: Levels of uPA, PAI-1, estrogen receptor (ER), and progesterone receptor (PgR) were assayed in cytosolic extracts derived from the primary breast tumors of 235 tamoxifennaive patients who had recurrent disease. The extracts were classified as positive or negative for each assayed factor. In some analyses, ER and PgR levels were evaluated together. In these analyses, three ER/PgR subsets were defined: low, intermediate, and high. All patients in the study received tamoxifen therapy upon relapse (median follow-up, 57 months). Association of the tested factors with the response to tamoxifen treatment was studied by logistic regression analysis. Association of the factors with progression-free and overall survival was further evaluated by Cox univariate and multivariate regression analyses. RESULTS: Patients with uPA-negative tumors exhibited a better response (tumor regression or stable disease, maintained for more than 6 months) to tamoxifen treatment than those with uPA-positive tumors (51% versus 26% response; odds ratio [OR] = 0.34; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.18-0.65). The response rate was also better for patients with PAI-1-negative tumors than for those with PAI-1-positive tumors (49% versus 35% response; OR = 0.57; 95% CI = 0.32-1.01). In addition, patients with uPA-positive or PAI-1-positive tumors showed shorter progression-free survival (P = .001 and P &lt; .05, respectively) and total survival after relapse (P = .005 and P &lt; .005, respectively). When patients were stratified by ER/PgR status, the only statistically significant association between uPA levels and reduced tamoxifen response was seen in the subset whose tumors possessed intermediate levels of ER/PgR (16% response in uPA-positive versus 60% response in uPA-negative tumors; OR = 0.13; 95% CI = 0.04-0.41). Overall, uPA status appeared independent of association with ER/PgR status in its ability to predict response to tamoxifen treatment. The association of PAI-1 expression and the response to tamoxifen was less pronounced when patients were stratified by ER/PgR status. CONCLUSION: Measurement of primary breast tumor uPA levels may be useful in predicting the overall response of metastatic disease to tamoxifen therapy.",

        "abstract": "Abolishing the inhibitory signal of intracellular cAMP is a prerequisite for effector T (Teff) cell function. The regulation of cAMP within leukocytes critically depends on its degradation by cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs). We have previously shown that PDE8A, a PDE isoform with 40-100-fold greater affinity for cAMP than PDE4, is selectively expressed in Teff vs. regulatory T (Treg) cells and controls CD4(+) Teff cell adhesion and chemotaxis. Here, we determined PDE8A expression and function in CD4(+) Teff cell populations in vivo. Using magnetic bead separation to purify leukocyte populations from the lung draining hilar lymph node (HLN) in a mouse model of ovalbumin-induced allergic airway disease (AAD), we found by Western immunoblot and quantitative (q)RT-PCR that PDE8A protein and gene expression are enhanced in the CD4(+) T cell fraction over the course of the acute inflammatory disease and recede at the late tolerant non-inflammatory stage. To evaluate PDE8A as a potential drug target, we compared the selective and combined effects of the recently characterized highly potent PDE8-selective inhibitor PF-04957325 with the PDE4-selective inhibitor piclamilast (PICL). As previously shown, PF-04957325 suppresses T cell adhesion to endothelial cells. In contrast, we found that PICL alone increased firm T cell adhesion to endothelial cells by ~20% and significantly abrogated the inhibitory effect of PF-04957325 on T cell adhesion by over 50% when cells were co-exposed to PICL and PF-04957325. Despite its robust effect on T cell adhesion, PF-04957325 was over two orders of magnitude less efficient than PICL in suppressing polyclonal Teff cell proliferation, and showed no effect on cytokine gene expression in these cells. More importantly, PDE8 inhibition did not suppress proliferation and cytokine production of myelin-antigen reactive proinflammatory Teff cells in vivo and in vitro. Thus, targeting PDE8 through PF-04957325 selectively regulates Teff cell interactions with endothelial cells without marked immunosuppression of proliferation, while PDE4 inhibition has partially opposing effects. Collectively, our data identify PF-04957325 as a novel function-specific tool for the suppression of Teff cell adhesion and indicate that PDE4 and PDE8 play unique and non-redundant roles in the control of Teff cell functions.",

The compound inhibited recombinant HIV-1 protease with a Ki of 0.2 nM. The inhibition constant versus human cathepsin D and human cathepsin E was 4 nM. Human pepsin and gastricsin were inhibited with Kis of 8 and 500 nM, respectively, and human renin was inhibited with a Ki of 190 microM. The replication of HIV-1/LAV, HIV-1/Z-84, and HIV-1/pLAI was inhibited with a 90% effective dose of 0.1 microM in acutely infected MT-2 cells. The 50% cytotoxic dose was 100 microM. Similar antiviral activity was observed when the compound was added up to 10 h after infection. At the effective concentration, processing of Gag precursor protein p55 was greatly reduced, confirming an action on the late stage of the virus life cycle, as expected. The efficacy of the inhibitor was also demonstrated by using primary human peripheral blood lymphocytes infected with the HIV-1/LAV strain, low-passage clinical isolates obtained from HIV-1-seropositive individuals (including a zidovudine-resistant strain), and HIV-2/ROD. In these cells, CGP 53437 delayed the onset of HIV replication in a dose-dependent fashion (substantial effects with concentrations of &gt; or = 0.1 microM) as long as the inhibitor was maintained in the culture. CGP 53437 was orally bioavailable in mice. Concentrations in plasma 10-fold in excess of the in vitro antiviral 90% effective dose could be sustained for several hours after oral application of 120 mg/kg. Therefore, CGP 53437 has the potential to be a therapeutically useful anti-HIV agent for the treatment of AIDS.",

Twenty-four hours following administration of anti-GBM antibody, renal function (blood urea nitrogen, BUN; plasma creatinine, PCr; creatinine clearance, CCr; fractional excretion of sodium, FENa; fractional excretion of urea, FEUrea) was determined to be impaired proportionally to the amount of injected antibody (5 to 30 mg/kg, i.v.). In a second series of experiments, a selective 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) inhibitor, SK&amp;F 107649, was used to investigate the involvement of 5-LO products in the pathophysiology of anti-GBM antibody-induced glomerulonephritis. In preliminary experiments. SK&amp;F 107649 (50 to 200 mg/kg, p.o.) inhibited ionophore (A23187)-stimulated whole blood leukotriene (LT) B4 production in a dose-dependent fashion (P &lt; 0.05 at doses &gt; or = 100 mg/kg). The anti-GBM antibody-mediated decrease in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and increase in BUN and PCr were dose-dependently attenuated by SK&amp;F 107649 (50 to 200 mg/kg, p.o. BID). These data confirm that glomerular LTB4 production is stimulated in anti-GBM antibody-induced glomerulonephritis, and demonstrate that inhibition of 5-LO by SK&amp;F 107649 normalizes BUN and PCr and attenuate the decrease in GFR following anti-GBM antibody treatment. These results provide additional evidence for a role of 5-LO products in immune-mediated renal disease, and suggest that pharmacologic inhibition of 5-LO may be of therapeutic value.",

On the other hand, very weak inhibition by SPR-210 was observed against human placenta aldehyde reductase, which is the most closely related enzyme to AR, and against several adeninenucleotide-requiring enzymes. SPR-210 showed a noncompetitive mechanism with respect to DL-glyceraldehyde against porcine lens AR. Sorbitol accumulation in isolated human erythrocytes was effectively inhibited by SPR-210 during incubation with 50 mM glucose (IC50 = 1.6 x 10(-8) M). Oral administration of SPR-210 (1-30 mg/kg/day for 5 days) to streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats decreased the sorbitol contents in the sciatic nerve and lens (ED50 = 1.9 and 6.8 mg/kg/day, respectively). SPR-210 had higher potency in the lens than other AR inhibitors. Moreover, the deterioration in motor nerve conduction velocity in diabetic rats was ameliorated by treatment with SPR-210 (1-30 mg/kg/day) accompanying the reduction in sorbitol content in the sciatic nerve. SPR-210 induced the recovery of the delayed peak latency of oscillatory potentials (O1-O4) in the electroretinogram in diabetic rats (10 mg/kg/day). These results suggest that the specific AR inhibitor SPR-210 will be a useful therapeutic agent for preventing and improving some diabetic complications, especially diabetic neuropathy and retinopathy, and therefore, can be discriminated from other AR inhibitors.",

In binding studies, the gastrin receptor antagonist PD-136,450 had at least 1000 fold greater affinity for gastrin (CCK-B) than CCK-A receptors. In this study the biological activity of PD-136,450 was evaluated in conscious and anaesthetised rats. PD-136,450 antagonised gastrin stimulated acid secretion after subcutaneous (IC50: 0.28 mumol/kg; conscious rats) and intravenous (IC50: 0.17 mumol/kg; anaesthetised rats) administration. In basal secreting fistula animals, the compound stimulated acid output to 30 (5)% of the maximal response to gastrin. Stimulant activity was not caused by gastrin release. As an agonist PD-136,450 was about 350 times less potent than gastrin-17 on a molar basis. In addition, PD-136,450 was a powerful agonist of pancreatic secretion in anaesthetised rats. The specific gastrin antagonist L-365,260 inhibited the (partial) agonist activity of PD-136,450 in the stomach and the specific CCK-A receptor antagonist L-364,718 inhibited the agonist activity of PD-136,450 in the pancreas.

It inhibited the activities of calmodulin-independent PDE and various protein kinases with higher IC50 values (2-40 microM). SCH 45752 does not appear to be a calmodulin antagonist. Furthermore, SCH 45752 affects smooth muscle contraction at a concentration of 30 microM; it potentiated the relaxing effect of sodium nitroprusside on carotid artery media contracted by histamine.

However, its moderate potency limits the degree of A1-receptor blockade that can be achieved by systemically administered N-0861. Structure activity studies were undertaken to invent a compound that had greater affinity for the A1-adenosine receptors than N-0861. C8-N-methylisopropylamino-N6-5'-endohydroxy-N-0861 (WRC-0571) inhibited [3H]-N6-cyclohexyladenosine (CHA) binding to guinea pig A1-receptors with a Ki value of 1.1 nM. WRC-0571 was 200-fold less potent at inhibiting [3H]-5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine binding to bovine A2a receptors (Ki = 234 nM). WRC-0571 also inhibited the binding of radioligands to cloned human A1, A2a and A3 adenosine receptors with affinities of 1.7, 105 and 7940 nM, respectively. Thus in human adenosine receptors, WRC-0571 is 62-fold selective for the A1 vs. A2a and 4670-fold selective for the A1 vs. A3 receptors; WRC-0571 is therefore the most A1 vs. A3 selective compound yet described. In guinea pig isolated atria, WRC-0571 antagonized the A1-mediated negative inotropic responses to 5'-N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA) with a KB of 3.4 nM. WRC-0571 was more than 2500-fold less potent at antagonizing NECA-induced A2b-mediated relaxation in guinea pig aorta. In anesthetized rats WRC-0571 antagonized adenosine-induced bradycardia at concentrations as low as 1 nmol/kg but failed to antagonize A2-mediated hindquarter vasodilation at concentrations up to 10,000 nmol/kg. WRC-0571 is orally active at concentrations as low as 0.3 mumol/kg. WRC-0571 is therefore a highly potent, highly selective antagonist of A1-adenosine receptors both in vitro and in vivo.",

The purpose of the present study was to explore this notion further by testing the neuroprotective properties of two novel brain-penetrating, lipid peroxidation inhibitors, U-101033E and U-104067F, in this model of neuronal degeneration. In Experiment 1, 14-day-old rats were pretreated with 3, 10, or 30 mg/kg U-101033E (po) 10 min before right facial nerve axotomy (Day 0) and then posttreated once a day from Day 1 to Day 6, and once every other day from Day 8 to Day 21. Rats were sacrificed 21 days postaxotomy and surviving cholinergic cell bodies were identified using choline acetyltransferase immunocytochemistry. Both 10 and 30 mg/kg U-101033E significantly enhanced motor neuron survival, with survival rates of 65.9-88.9% being noted in comparison to 51.7-62% survival in vehicle controls (P &lt; or = 0.05). Experiment 2 demonstrated a significant neuroprotective effect of 10 and 30 mg/kg U-104067F using the same dosing schedule. Experiment 3 was designed to test whether shorter periods of drug exposure (e.g., 5 or 7 days) would be sufficient to preserve motor neurons in rats treated with 10 mg/kg U-101033E. The results suggested that as little as 5 days of drug treatment is sufficient to enhance motor neuron survival. Finally, Experiment 4 demonstrated an 18-19% increase in motor neuron survival in rats treated with 10 and 30 mg/kg U-104067F for 5 consecutive days postaxotomy. Taken together, the attenuation of motor neuron degeneration by the two pyrrolopyrimidine lipid peroxidation inhibitors, U-101033E and U-104067F, lends support to the notion that lipid peroxidation contributes to the pathogenesis of axotomy-induced neurodegeneration.",

Treatment of the cells with 2 microM CGP 48664 led to a depletion of cellular spermidine and spermine. The putrescine content, in contrast, was markedly increased. Cells seeded in the presence of the inhibitor showed a significant decrease in growth rate, which was fully reversed by the addition of 2 microM spermidine or 1 microM spermine. The syntheses of ornithine decarboxylase and AdoMetDC were greatly increased in cells treated with CGP 48664. These increases were not correlated with similar changes in the mRNA levels, indicating the involvement of a translational mechanism. CGP 48664 was demonstrated to be a very poor competitor of spermidine uptake in the L1210 cells. L1210 cells deficient in polyamine transport were as sensitive to the antiproliferative effect of the inhibitor as were the parental cells, indicating that CGP 48664 did not enter the cells by the polyamine transport system. In addition to inhibiting AdoMetDC, CGP 48664 stabilized the enzyme against degradation. In the present study we also demonstrated that aminoguanidine (AMG), which is frequently used in cellular systems to inhibit any action of serum polyamine oxidase, apparently inhibits AdoMetDC by an irreversible mechanism that markedly stabilizes the enzyme against proteolytic degradation. CGP 48664 and the parental compound methylglyoxal bis(guanylhydrazone), which is also a potent inhibitor of AdoMetDC, contain one or two AMG-like moieties; the importance of these residues in the inhibition of AdoMetDC is discussed.",

Glucose 6-phosphate hydrolysis was determined in the presence of chlorogenic acid or of new synthesized derivatives in intact rat liver microsomes in order to assess the inhibitory potency of the compounds on the translocase component. Variation in the 3-position of chlorogenic acid had only poor effects on inhibitory potency. Introduction of lipophilic side chain in the 1-position led to 100-fold more potent inhibitors. Functional assays on isolated perfused rat liver with compound 29i, a representative of the more potent derivatives, showed a dose-dependent inhibition of gluconeogenesis and glycogenolyosis, suggesting glucose-6-phosphatase as the locus of interference of the compound for inhibition of hepatic glucose production also in the isolated organ model.

At 4 degrees, hementin had no activity, but this inhibition was fully reversible. Complete inactivation occurred in the presence of EDTA, cysteine, DTT, sodium phosphate and at extreme pH (greater than 11 or less than 5), whereas citrate, Tris, glycine, and EGTA caused only partial loss of activity. DFP, PMSF, iodoacetic acid, and leupeptin had no effect on hementin activity. The data indicated hementin to be a neutral metalloprotease with optimum pH of 7.5. The enzyme had high affinity for cleaving fibrinogen and calculations of kinetic data from a double-reciprocal plot gave a Km of hementin for fibrinogen of 1.0 +/- 0.1 microM. Normal human citrated plasma or fresh blood were rendered incoagulable after incubation with hementin, indicating that the enzyme activity was not affected by plasma protease inhibitors. Plasma levels of coagulation factors II, V, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XII, prekallikrein, and high-molecular-weight kininogen were not altered by the enzyme. Hementin, a neutral metalloprotease resistant to plasma protease inhibitors, executes its anticoagulant effect on blood by selective cleavage of fibrinogen.",

        "abstract": "Recent studies from our laboratory have indicated that protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPase) inhibitors can down-modulate the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-mediated activation of the nuclear transcription factor NF-kappa B in ML-1a, a monocytic cell line (Singh and Aggarwal, J. Biol. Chem. 1995: 270: 10631). Since TNF is one of the major inducers of various adhesion molecules in human endothelial cells and their expression is known to require the activation of NF-kappa B, we examined the effect of PTPase inhibitors on the TNF-mediated induction of intracellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1, vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM)-1 and endothelial leukocyte adhesion molecule (ELAM)-1. Like ML-1a, human dermal microvessel endothelial cells (MVEC) treated with TNF rapidly activated (within 30 min) NF-kappa B; this effect was completely abolished by co-treatment with phenylarsine oxide (PAO), a specific inhibitor of PTPase. The induction of ICAM-1, VCAM-1, and ELAM-1 by TNF in MVEC occurred within 6 h and was also completely down-regulated by PAO in a dose-dependent manner. PAO was found to be effective even when added 3 h after TNF, suggesting a rapid mode of action of this inhibitor. Besides PAO, other inhibitors of PTPase, including pervanadate and diamide, also blocked TNF-dependent NF-kappa B activation and induction of all the three adhesion proteins. Consistent with these results, the attachment of monocytes to MVEC was also blocked by the PTPase inhibitors. Thus, overall, our results demonstrate that a PTPase is involved either directly or indirectly in the pathway leading to the induction of endothelial cell adhesion molecules by TNF. Because of their role in cell adhesion, PTPase may provide a novel target of drug development for treatment of inflammation, atherogenesis, and tumor metastasis.",

Previous reports suggest that polyamine biosynthesis by ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) has an essential role in macrophage activation by TNF. In the current study, TNF induced rapid increases in the putrescine and spermine content of PMNs. Difluoromethylornithine (DFMO), a selective inhibitor of ODC, inhibited these increases and blunted the enhancement of superoxide generation and secondary granule release associated with priming by TNF. DFMO did not affect the expression of TNF receptors or block receptor-independent activation of the respiratory burst by phorbol esters. Moreover, DFMO did not antagonize induction of adhesion or IL-1 beta mRNA expression by TNF. Thus, polyamine biosynthesis plays an important role in priming by TNF, but is not involved in all PMN responses to this cytokine.

In this study, a natural compound tryptanthrin was discovered to be a novel potent IDO-1 inhibitor by screening of indole-based structures. Three series of 13 tryptanthrin derivatives were synthesized, and the structure-activity analysis was undertaken. The optimization led to the identification of 5c, which exhibited the inhibitory activity at a nanomolar level. In vitro 5c dramatically augmented the proliferation of T cells.

        "abstract": "Recent progress in deciphering the molecular basis of carcinogenesis is of utmost importance to the development of new anticancer strategies. To this end, it is essential to understand the regulation of both normal cell proliferation and its alterations in cancer cells. We have previously demonstrated that in ras-transformed cells there is an increased level of phosphorylcholine (PCho) resulting from a constitutive activation on choiline kinase (ChoK). The importance of ChoK for the regulation of cell proliferation has also been proposed since an inhibitor for this enzyme, hemicholinium-3 (HC-3), drastically reduces entry into the S phase after stimulation with growth factors. Here we report the synthesis of several new compounds which are highly specific inhibitors for ChoK, with up to 1000-fold or 600-fold increased inhibitory activity, compared to HC-3 under ex vivo or in vitro conditions respectively. These novel compounds also drastically reduce entry into the S phase after stimulation with specific growth factors. A more profound inhibition of cell proliferation was observed in ras-, src- and mos-transformed cells in the presence of ChoK inhibitors, compared to their parental, untransformed NIH3T3 cells. By contrast, this effect was not observed in fos-transformed cells. While ras, src and mos transformation is associated with elevated levels of ChoK activity, fos-induced transformation does not affect ChoK activity. The inhibitory effect on proliferation of the new compounds correlates with their ability to inhibit the production of phosphorylcholine in whole cells, a proposed novel second messenger for cell proliferation. These results strongly support a critical role of choline kinase in the regulation of cell growth and makes this enzyme a novel target for the design of new antiproliferative and anticancer drugs.",

Complementary DNAs (cDNAs) encoding the human mGluR4, human mGluR7, and human mGluR8 were isolated from human cerebellum, fetal brain or retinal cDNA libraries. The human mGluR4, mGluR7 and mGluR8 receptors were 912, 915 and 908 amino acid residues long and share 67-70% amino acid similarity with each other and 42-45% similarity with the members of mGluR subgroups I and II. The human mGluR4 and mGluR7 had amino acid identity of 96% and 99.5% with rat mGluR4 and 7, respectively, whereas the human mGluR8 has 98.8% amino acid identity with the mouse mGluR8. The nucleotide and amino acid sequences in the coding region of human mGluR4 and mGluR7 were found to be identical to the previously published sequences by Flor et al. and Makoff et al.

        "abstract": "Inward rectifier K+ channels, which modulate electrical activity in many cell types, are regulated by protein kinases, guanine-nucleotide-binding proteins (G proteins) and probably actin cytoskeleton. Generation of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2) by ATP-dependent lipid kinases is known to activate inward rectifier K+ channels in cardiac membrane patches. Here we report that several cloned inward rectifier K+ channels directly bind PIP2, and that this binding correlates with channel activity. Application of ATP or PIP2 liposomes activates the cloned channels. Stabilized by lipid phosphatase inhibitors, PIP2 antibodies potently inhibit each channel with a unique rate (GIRK1/4 approximately GIRK2 &gt;&gt; IRK1 approximately ROMK. Consistent with the faster dissociation of PIP2 from the GIRK channels, the carboxy terminus of GIRK1 binds 3H-PIP2 liposomes more weakly than does that of IRK1 or ROMK1. Mutation of a conserved arginine to glutamine at position 188 reduces the ability of ROMK1 to bind PIP2 and increases its sensitivity to inhibition by PIP2 antibodies. Interactions between GIRK channels and PIP2 are modulated by the betagamma subunits of the G protein (Gbetagamma). When GIRK1/4 channels are allowed to run down completely, they are not activated by addition of Gbetagamma alone, but application of PIP2 activates them in minutes without Gbetagamma and in just seconds with Gbetagamma. Finally, coexpression of Gbetagamma with GIRK channels slows the inhibition of K+ currents by PIP2 antibodies by more than 10-fold. Thus Gbetagamma activates GIRK channels by stabilizing interactions between PIP2 and the K+ channel.",

We describe the molecular properties of EM-652, the active metabolite of EM-800, a novel nonsteroidal antiestrogen compound, on the transcriptional functions of ER alpha and ER beta. Using RT-PCR, we show that ER alpha and ER beta are expressed in mouse mammary glands, suggesting that both receptors should be considered putative targets for antiestrogen action in the breast. In cotransfection assays using a synthetic estrogen-responsive promoter, EM-652 shows no agonistic activity on ER alpha and ER beta transcriptional function and blocks the estradiol (E2)-mediated activation of both ER alpha and ER beta. EM-652 is also very effective in abrogating E2-stimulated ER alpha and ER beta trans-activation of the pS2 promoter in HeLa cells. EM-652 does not alter binding of ER alpha and ER beta to DNA. The Ras-mediated induction of ER alpha and ER beta transcriptional activity in the presence of E2 is also completely abolished by EM-652. In addition, EM-652 blocks the E2-dependent activation of ER alpha and ER beta by the steroid hormone receptor coactivator-1 as well as the in vitro interaction between SRC-1 and the ligand-binding domains of both ERs.

IPCAR proved fully inhibitory against human nasopharyngeal carcinoma KB cells expressing the MDR phenotype, whereas IPCAR-resistant renal adenocarcinoma ACHN/R1 cells were fully susceptible to inhibition by a number of anticancer drugs, with the exception of 6TG, 6MP and 5FU towards which they showed a partial cross-resistance.

The relative potencies of CRF antagonists and agonists to the two types of cloned CRF receptors overexpressed stably in Chinese hamster ovary cells are determined using the antagonist radioligand 125I- [DTyr1]astressin (Ast*), and the agonist radioligand, 125I -[Tyr0]rat urocortin (Ucn*). The inhibitory binding constants (Ki) of astressin and urocortin are 1 to 2 nM for all receptors and are independent of which radioligand is employed. Astressin binds with high affinity to the native cerebellar/brain stem receptor and relative potencies of selected CRF analogs determined with Ast* on the native receptor are similar to those obtained for the cloned CRF-R1. The specific binding of Ast* to endogenous brain receptors is greater than that of Ucn*, resulting in more sites being detected by the antagonist than by the agonist. In contrast to another CRF agonist, the binding of Ucn* to the cloned receptors is relatively insensitive to guanyl nucleotides at both 20 degreesC and 37 degreesC; however, its binding to the native receptor is displaced by guanyl nucleotides at 37 degreesC and, to a lesser degree, at 20 degreesC. As expected, the binding of the antagonist Ast* is not affected by guanyl nucleotides.

The tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate has revolutionized the treatment of GISTs. Unfortunately, primary or acquired resistance to imatinib does occur in GISTs and forms a major problem. Although sunitinib malate, a multi-kinase inhibitor, has shown effectiveness against imatinib-resistant GISTs, recent studies have indicated that some imatinib-resistant GISTs harboring secondary mutations in the KIT activation loop were also resistant to sunitinib. Therefore, new drugs capable of overcoming the dual drug resistance of GISTs probably have potential clinical utility. In this study, we investigated the efficacy of flumatinib, an inhibitor of BCR-ABL/PDGFR/KIT, against 32D cells transformed by various KIT mutants and evaluated its potency to overcome the drug resistance of certain mutants. Interestingly, our in vitro study revealed that flumatinib effectively overcame the drug resistance of certain KIT mutants with activation loop mutations (i.e., D820G, N822K, Y823D, and A829P). Our in vivo study consistently suggested that flumatinib had superior efficacy compared with imatinib or sunitinib against 32D cells with the secondary mutation Y823D. Molecular modeling of flumatinib docked to the KIT kinase domain suggested a special mechanism underlying the capability of flumatinib to overcome the drug-resistance conferred by activation loop mutations. These findings suggest that flumatinib could be a promising therapeutic agent against GISTs resistant to both imatinib and sunitinib because of secondary mutations in the activation loop.",

Comparison of the Ki values for the inhibition of [3H]DA uptake with [3H]WIN 35,428 binding reveals that, for uptake blockers and D-amphetamine, it is the high affinity component that shares pharmacological identity with effects on DA uptake (r = 0.9985), whereas for DA it is the low affinity site. In striking contrast, however, [3H]GBR 12,935 binding to COS-7 cells could not be made to exhibit a pharmacological profile indicative of the DA transporter and suggests that the site regulating functional [3H]DA uptake may not be identical with sites labeled by [3H]GBR 12,935 in these cells. Moreover, these sites appear unrelated to those previously described in native membranes as \"piperazine acceptor\" or P450 proteins. Comparison of Ki values and rank order of potency for the inhibition of [3H]WIN 35,428 or [3H]GBR 12,935 binding to human caudate membranes reveals pharmacological homology, but not identity, with that of the cloned DA uptake process. Taken together, these data suggest that 1) [3H]WIN 35,428 recognizes two sites of the DA transporter, of which only one appears to represent the functional state of the protein, and 2) [3H]WIN 35,428 and [3H]GBR 12,935 do not appear to bind the same functional form/state of the DA transporter. Whether the nonidentity of binding sites is a manifestation of some post-translational regulatory event (e.g., phosphorylation/accessory binding protein) or caused by the existence of multiple molecular forms of the DA transporter is currently unknown.",

        "abstract": "Experimental studies have indicated that the central histaminergic system plays an important role in the inhibition of seizures through the stimulation of histamine H1 receptors. H1 receptor antagonists, including classical antiallergic drugs, occasionally may induce convulsions in healthy children and patients with epilepsy. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of antazoline and ketotifen (two H1 receptor antagonists) on the anticonvulsant activity of antiepileptic drugs against maximal electroshock (MES)-induced convulsions in mice. The following antiepileptic drugs were used: valproate, carbamazepine, diphenylhydantoin and phenobarbital. In addition, the effects of antiepileptic drugs alone or in combination with antazoline or ketotifen were studied on long-term memory (tested in the passive avoidance task) and motor performance (evaluated in the chimney test), acutely and after 7-day treatment with these H1 receptor antagonists. The influence of antazoline and ketotifen on the free plasma and brain levels of the antiepileptics was also evaluated. Antazoline (at 0.5 mg/kg), given acutely and after 7-day treatment, significantly diminished the electroconvulsive threshold. Similarly, ketotifen, after acute and chronic doses of 8 mg/kg markedly reduced the threshold for electroconvulsions. In both cases, antazoline and ketotifen were without effect upon this parameter at lower doses. Antazoline (0.25 mg/kg) significantly raised the ED50 value of carbamazepine against MES (both, acutely and after 7-day treatment). Furthermore antazoline (0.25 mg/kg) also reduced the anticonvulsant activity of diphenylhydantoin, but only after repeated administration, without modifying the brain and free plasma level of this drug. Moreover, valproate and phenobarbital did not change their protective activity when combined with antazoline. Ketotifen (4 mg/kg) possessed a biphasic action, acutely it enhanced the anticonvulsant action of carbamazepine and phenobarbital while, following 7-day treatment, reduced the antiseizure activity of carbamazepine. Ketotifen did not affect the free plasma or brain levels of antiepileptics tested. Only acute antazoline (0.25 mg/kg) applied with valproate impaired the performance of mice evaluated in the chimney test. Ketotifen (4 mg/kg) co-administered with conventional antiepileptic drugs impaired motor coordination in mice treated with valproate, phenobarbital or diphenylhydantoin. Acute and chronic antazoline (0.25 mg/kg) alone or in combination with antiepileptic drugs did not disturb long-term memory, tested in the passive avoidance task. Similarly, ketotifen (4 mg/kg) did not impair long-term memory, acutely and after 7-day treatment. However, valproate alone or in combination with chronic ketotifen (4 mg/kg) worsened long-term memory. The results of this study indicate that H1 receptor antagonists, crossing the blood brain barrier, should be used with caution in epileptic patients. This is because antazoline reduced the protective potential of diphenylhydantoin and carbamazepine. Also, ketotifen reduced the protection offered by carbamazepine and elevated the adverse activity of diphenylhydantoin, phenobarbital and valproate.",

        "abstract": "SR 121463A, a potent and selective, orally active, nonpeptide vasopressin V2 receptor antagonist, has been characterized in several in vitro and in vivo models. This compound displayed highly competitive and selective affinity for V2 receptors in rat, bovine and human kidney (0.6 &lt; or = Ki [nM] &lt; or = 4.1). In this latter preparation, SR 121463A potently antagonized arginine vasopressin (AVP)-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity (Ki = 0.26+/-0.04 nM) without any intrinsic agonistic effect. In autoradiographic experiments performed in rat kidney sections, SR 121463A displaced [3H]AVP labeling especially in the medullo-papillary region and confirmed that it is a suitable tool for mapping V2 receptors. In comparison, the nonpeptide V2 antagonist, OPC-31260, showed much lower affinity for animal and human renal V2 receptors and lower efficacy to inhibit vasopressin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase (Ki in the 10 nanomolar range). Moreover, OPC-31260 exhibited a poor V2 selectivity profile and can be considered as a V2/V1a ligand. In normally hydrated conscious rats, SR 121463A induced powerful aquaresis after intravenous (0.003-0.3 mg/kg) or oral (0.03-10 mg/kg) administration. The effect was dose-dependent and lasted about 6 hours at the dose of 3 mg/kg p.o. OPC-31260 had a similar aquaretic profile but with markedly lower oral efficacy. The action of SR 121463A was purely aquaretic with no changes in urine Na+ and K+ excretions unlike that of known diuretic agents such as furosemide or hydrochlorothiazide. In addition, no antidiuretic properties have been detected with SR 121463A in vasopressin-deficient Brattleboro rats. Thus, SR 121463A is the most potent and selective, orally active V2 antagonist yet described and could be a powerful tool for exploring V2 receptors and the therapeutical usefulness of V2 blocker aquaretic agents in water-retaining diseases.",

        "title": "HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor has protective effects against stroke events in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Recent clinical studies suggest that 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitors (statins) exert protective effects against nonhemorrhagic stroke. In a murine cerebral ischemia model produced by occlusion of the middle cerebral artery, statins were shown to reduce infarct size. However, the effect of statins on hypertension-based stroke is unknown. The purpose of this study is to clarify the effect of a statin on stroke in stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR-SP), in which both cerebral hemorrhage and infarction occur. METHODS: We treated SHR-SP chronically from 4 weeks of age with cerivastatin (2 mg/kg per day by gavage) or vehicle. The physiological parameters, the incidence of stroke-associated symptoms, and mortality were assessed. RESULTS: At 14 weeks of age, the incidence (13+/-3% versus 37+/-8%; P&lt;0.01) and the size of stroke (1.6+/-0.2 versus 2.2+/-0.1 arbitrary units; P&lt;0.01) were significantly decreased by cerivastatin, although blood pressure and plasma cholesterol levels were not different. Moreover, stroke-associated symptoms and early mortality of SHR-SP were markedly reduced in the statin-treated group (mortality at the age of 15 weeks: 15% versus 50%; P&lt;0.05). Statin treatment significantly reduced superoxide production from nonstroke parenchyma of brain and infiltration of inflammatory cells to the stroke lesions. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that a high dose of statin exerts protection against hypertension-based stroke and ameliorates the disease severity via inhibition of superoxide production and modulation of inflammation in brain.",

        "abstract": "We have previously found that the induction of long-term potentiation in the synaptic pathway from the basolateral amygdala to the dentate gyrus (BLA-DG LTP) is regulated by L-type Ca(2+) channels, dopamine D(2) receptors and GABAergic inhibition. In the present study, we investigated possible relations among the three mechanisms by using anesthetized rats. Blockade of GABAergic inhibition with picrotoxin abolished both the inhibitory effect of the dopamine D(2) receptor antagonist chlorpromazine and the promoting effect of the dopamine D(2) receptor agonist quinpirole on the induction of BLA-DG LTP. However, the inhibitory effect of the L-type Ca(2+) channel blocker verapamil on BLA-DG LTP was not affected by picrotoxin. These results suggest that the role of dopamine D(2) receptors in the induction of BLA-DG LTP is modulatory and depends on GABAergic inhibition, whereas the role of L-type Ca(2+) channels is fundamental.",

        "abstract": "Levocabastine is an antiallergic drug acting as a histamine H1-receptor antagonist. In allergic conjunctivitis (AC), it may also antagonize up-regulation of the intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) expressed on epithelial conjunctival cells. However, little is known about its effects on eosinophils, important effector cells in AC. The adhesion molecule integrin alpha(4)beta(1) is expressed in eosinophils; it interacts with the vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and fibronectin (FN) in vascular endothelial cells and contributes to eosinophil activation and infiltration in AC. This study provides evidence that in a scintillation proximity assay levocabastine (IC(50) 406 microM), but not the first-generation antihistamine chlorpheniramine, displaced (125)I-FN binding to human integrin alpha(4)beta(1) and, in flow cytometry analysis, levocabastine antagonized the binding of a primary antibody to integrin alpha(4) expressed on the Jurkat cell surface. Levocabastine, but not chlorpheniramine, binds the alpha(4)beta(1) integrin and prevents eosinophil adhesion to VCAM-1, FN or human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVEC) in vitro. Similarly, levocabastine affects alpha(L)beta(2)/ICAM-1-mediated adhesion of Jurkat cells. In a model of AC levocabastine eye drops reduced the clinical aspects of the late-phase reaction and the conjunctival expression of alpha(4)beta(1) integrin by reducing infiltrated eosinophils. We propose that blockade of integrin-mediated cell adhesion might be a target of the antiallergic action of levocabastine and may play a role in preventing eosinophil adhesion and infiltration in AC.",

        "abstract": "1. Glycopyrrolate, a synthetic quaternary ammonium compound had biphasic effects on the contraction of guinea-pig atrium. At concentrations between 0.4 and 20 microM, glycopyrrolate induced a small but consistent increase in the contraction force. 2. Further increase in the concentration of glycopyrrolate produced a concentration-dependent reduction in the force of contraction with a EC50 of 0.24 mM. 3. This negative inotropic effect was opposed by a Ca2+ channel agonist, Bay K 8644. Glycopyrrolate also antagonized potently the depressant effects of carbachol and acetylcholine in guinea-pig atrium. 4. Schild analysis showed a pA2 value of 8.16 against carbachol and 8.39 against acetylcholine. These similar pA2 values suggested that both compounds may have a common interacting site. The interactions however cannot be explained by a simple competition model as the slopes of the Schild plots were larger than unity. 5. The mutual competition between glycopyrrolate and quinuclidinyl benzilate (QNB), gallamine or methoctramine indicated that glycopyrrolate could have multiple action sites in the atrium. Interaction at an allosteric site was implicated. 6. Radioligand binding studies showed that glycopyrrolate displaced pirenzepine (PZ) and AF-DX 384 from their binding to the M1 and M2 muscarinic receptors in guinea-pig brain membranes respectively. 7. The respective binding constants (Kis) were 0.60 and 0.03 nM. The Hill coefficient value (nH) for glycopyrrolate against [3H] PZ was larger than unity, suggesting positive cooperativity at the receptor complex. In contrast, the nH of the agonist [3H] AF-DX 384 was not different from unity, indicating a simple competitive inhibition. 8.

The thermodynamic parameters deltaGo (standard free energy), deltaHo (standard enthalpy) and deltaSo (standard entropy) of the binding equilibrium to rat brain receptors were determined by means of affinity measurements carried out at four different temperatures (0, 10, 20 and 25 degrees) and van't Hoff plots. Two temperatures (0 and 25 degrees) were considered for human receptors. Affinity constants were obtained from inhibition assays on membrane preparations of rat brain and CHO cells by use of the antagonist [3H]1,3-dipropyl-8-cyclopentylxanthine ([3H]DPCPX) as selective adenosine A1 receptor radioligand. As for rat brain receptors, full agonist binding was totally entropy driven, whereas antagonist binding was essentially enthalpy driven. Partial agonist binding appeared both enthalpy and entropy driven. As for human receptors, full agonist affinity was highly dependent on the presence of Thr277. Moreover, affinity to both wild-type and mutant receptors was enhanced by temperature increase, suggesting a totally entropy-driven binding. Antagonist binding did not depend on the presence of Thr277. Antagonist affinity decreased with an increase in temperature, suggesting a mainly enthalpy-driven binding. Partial agonist binding was significantly dependent on the presence of Thr277 at 25 degrees, whereas such a dependence was not evident at 0 degrees. It is concluded that Thr277 contributes only to the binding of adenosine derivatives and that its role changes drastically with the receptor conformation and with the type of agonist (full or partial) interacting with the adenosine A1 receptors.",

Here, we compared etoricoxib, a specific COX-2 inhibitor, with other cyclooxygenase inhibitors on articular incapacitation, edema, leukocyte migration, and gastric damage, in a model of LPS-induced reactive arthritis in rats. METHODS: E. coli Lipopolysaccharide was injected into a carrageenan-primed knee-joint of rats. The effects of etoricoxib, piroxicam, indomethacin, as well the combination of etoricoxib either with piroxicam or indomethacin, were evaluated on articular incapacitation and edema. Afterwards, the synovial leukocyte ontent and the stomach bleeding points were counted. RESULTS: Etoricoxib, piroxicam, and indomethacin dose-dependently inhibited incapacitation and edema. However, only etoricoxib inhibited both mononuclear and polymorphonuclear leukocyte migration. Piroxicam inhibited only mononuclear migration, while indomethacin even increased polymorphonuclear content in inflamed synovia. Associating etoricoxib with either subeffective doses of piroxicam or indomethacin did not enhance the hyponociceptive or the antiedematogenic effect, but prevented the anti-leukocyte migration effect and increased gastric damage.

Since delta-T3 and gamma-T3 possess greater HMGR inhibition than alpha-T3, we postulated that these analogues might have a greater effect on protein prenylation, and thus on monocyte adhesion and endothelial adhesion molecule expression in comparison to alpha-T3. Hence, we pursued to investigate the effect of various analogues of tocotrienol (alpha, gamma, delta) on monocytic cell adhesion and expression of adhesion molecules using a human umbilical vein endothelial cell-line, EA.hy926, as the model system. Relative to alpha-T3, delta-T3 displayed a more profound inhibitory effect on monocytic cell adherence using a 15 micromol/L concentration within 24 h (delta: 42 +/- 5%; alpha: 26 +/- 8% vs. control). This inhibitory action was reversed by co-incubation with farnesol and geranylgeraniol, suggesting a role for prenylated proteins in the regulation of monocyte adhesion. To further evaluate the effect of tocotrienols on the vascular endothelium, we measured the surface expression of adhesion molecules. Compared to alpha-T3, delta-T3 markedly inhibited the expression of VCAM-1 (delta: 57 +/- 6%; alpha: 37 +/- 10% vs. control) and E-selection (delta: 36 +/- 3%; alpha: 18 +/- 6% vs. control) in TNF-alpha activated endothelial cells.

The efficacy of DTTX30, a combined thromboxane A2 receptor blocker-thromboxane synthetase inhibitor, in inhibiting recurrent coronary thrombosis was evaluated in vivo using a canine model of unstable angina pectoris. METHODS AND RESULTS: Pentobarbital-anesthetized dogs (total of 25) were used in which acute damage of the proximal left circumflex coronary artery, together with mechanical stenosis, produced an occlusive thrombosis. When the platelet plug was removed by rubbing the vessel, the occlusion returned reproducibly for at least 2 hours in control studies. To evaluate the antithrombotic efficacy of DTTX30, a reproducible pattern of occlusive coronary thrombi was first established over a period of one hour. Thereafter, DTTX30 (0.12 mg/kg i.v. bolus plus 0.29 mg/kg/hr), acetylsalicylic acid (ASA, 5 mg/kg, i.v. bolus), vapiprost (1.0 mg/kg i.v. bolus plus 1.0 mg/kg/ hr), or vehicle was administered and observations continued for one additional hour. At the end of the one hour observation period, epinephrine (0.3 microgram/kg/min i.v.) was infused (with continued DTTX30, vapiprost or vehicle infusion) and observations were continued for an additional 30 min. DTTX30 eliminated the recurrent arterial thrombus formation in all dogs without significant systemic or left ventricular hemodynamic effects. Infusion of epinephrine to further provoke thrombus formation produced a significant enhancement of left ventricular pressure development (LV dP/dt) and arterial diastolic and systolic pressures but failed to initiate thrombus formation. DTTX30 inhibited fully collagen-induced platelet aggregation ex vivo and produced an approximate 3-fold prolongation of the sublingual bleeding time. ASA eliminated thrombus formation in 4 of 5 dogs, but the additional prothrombotic stimulus of epinephrine infusion produced recurrent thrombus formation in all dogs. Collagen-induced platelet aggregation ex vivo was inhibited by acetylsalicylic acid, but sublingual bleeding time was unaffected. Vapiprost inhibited arterial thrombus formation in all dogs, but thrombus formation returned with the addition of epinephrine. There was a tendency for prolonged bleeding times with vapiprost administration and collagen-induced platelet aggregation ex vivo was effectively inhibited. CONCLUSION: These studied indicate that the combined inhibition of the thromboxane A2 receptor together with inhibition of thromboxane synthetase provides superior antithrombotic activity in vivo than does thromboxane A2 receptor blockade alone (vapiprost) or inhibition of cyclooxygenase (ASA). Thrombus formation even with the additional stimulation of epinephrine was inhibited by DTTX30 but neither vapiprost nor ASA was effective in this setting.",

        "abstract": "Signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 (STAT1) is a latent signal transducer protein which, on phosphorylation, is translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus and is subsequently activated. This study was designed to determine the involvement of histamine receptors in histamine-mediated effect on STAT1 phosphorylation. It is known that the actions of histamine mediated through H1 and H2 receptors are dependent on their respective downstream pathways, Ca(2+)-PKC and cAMP-PKA. In this study, we investigated the significance of PKA in STAT1 phosphorylation. C57BL/6 mouse splenocytes were isolated and treated with histamine (10(-7)-10(-4) M) and then activated with PMA (phorbol 12 myristate 13-acetate) plus ionomycin. The phosphorylated STAT1 levels were analyzed by immunoblotting.

We observed that histamine augmented the phosphorylation of STAT1 through both H1 and H2 receptors. Furthermore, H1 and H2 receptor antagonists displayed inverse agonism. Ca(2+)-PKC-induced phosphorylation of STAT1 was completely inhibited by H89 and significantly inhibited by RpcAMPs. DbcAMP and forskolin augmented the Ca(2+)-PKC-induced STAT1 phosphorylation thus suggesting a convergent crosstalk between the two histamine receptor signaling pathways, PKA and PKC.",

        "title": "Licofelone (ML-3000), a dual inhibitor of 5-lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase, reduces the level of cartilage chondrocyte death in vivo in experimental dog osteoarthritis: inhibition of pro-apoptotic factors.",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To evaluate in vivo therapeutic efficacy of licofelone, a novel competitive dual inhibitor of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LOX) and cyclooxygenase (COX) in chondrocyte death in the canine ligament transection model of osteoarthritis (OA), and to explore its effect on factors involved in the apoptotic phenomenon, i.e., caspase-3, COX-2, and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS). METHODS: Cartilage specimens were obtained from 3 experimental groups of dogs: Group 1, dogs subjected to sectioning of the anterior cruciate ligament of the right knee and given placebo treatment; Groups 2 and 3, operated dogs that received oral treatment with licofelone (2.5 or 5.0 mg/kg/day, respectively) for 8 weeks starting immediately after surgery. All dogs were killed 8 weeks postsurgery. The cartilage level of chondrocyte death was detected by TUNEL reaction. Cartilage distribution of caspase-3, COX-2, and iNOS was documented by immunohistochemistry using specific antibodies, and other levels were quantified by morphometric analysis. RESULTS: In cartilage specimens from placebo treated dogs a large number of chondrocytes in the superficial layers stained positive for TUNEL reaction. Treatment with therapeutic concentrations of licofelone (2.5 and 5.0 mg/kg/day) markedly reduced the level of chondrocyte apoptosis to the same extent in both therapeutic groups (p &lt; 0.0001, p &lt; 0.002, respectively). In these groups, the levels of caspase-3, COX-2, and iNOS in cartilage from both condyles and plateaus were also significantly decreased (p &lt; 0.0001, p &lt; 0.0001, p &lt; 0.0002, respectively) compared to the control (placebo) group. CONCLUSION: Licofelone is an effective treatment in vivo, capable of reducing the level of OA chondrocyte death. This effect is likely mediated by a decrease in the level of caspase-3 activity, which may be related to the reduced production of 2 major factors involved in chondrocyte apoptosis, NO and prostaglandin E2. These findings may explain some of the mechanisms by which licofelone reduces the progression of experimental OA.",

        "abstract": "A novel class of nonnucleoside hepatitis C virus (HCV) polymerase inhibitors characterized by a dihydropyrone core was identified by high-throughput screening. Crystallographic studies of these compounds in complex with the polymerase identified an allosteric binding site close to the junction of the thumb and finger domains, approximately 30 A away from the catalytic center. AG-021541, a representative compound from this series, displayed measurable in vitro antiviral activity against the HCV genotype 1b subgenomic replicon with a mean 50% effective concentration of 2.9 muM. To identify mutations conferring in vitro resistance to AG-021541, resistance selection was carried out using HCV replicon cells either by serial passages in increasing concentrations of AG-021541 or by direct colony formation at fixed concentrations of the compound. We identified several amino acid substitutions in the AG-021541-binding region of the polymerase, including M423(T/V/I), M426T, I482(S/T), and V494A, with M423T as the predominant change observed. These mutants conferred various levels of resistance to AG-021541 and structurally related compounds but remained sensitive to interferon and HCV polymerase inhibitors known to interact with the active site or other allosteric sites of the protein. In addition, dihydropyrone polymerase inhibitors retained activity against replicons that contain signature resistance changes to other polymerase inhibitors, including S282T, C316N, M414T, and P495(S/L), indicating their potential to be used in combination therapies with these polymerase inhibitors. AG-021541-resistant replicon cell lines provide a valuable tool for mechanism-of-action studies of dihydropyrone polymerase inhibitors. The clinical relevance of in vitro resistance to HCV polymerase inhibitors remains to be investigated.",

The compound was also active in chronically infected Molt-4/HIV-1IIIB cells, and inhibited the proteolytic processing of p55 into p17, suggesting that its anti-HIV activity was derived from HIV protease inhibition. The compound showed more potent activity (IC90 value was 0.03-0.25 microM) against clinical isolates of HIV in 5 out of 6 patients examined with varying clinical status in an ex vivo assay. One isolate, however, from the sixth patient, was less sensitive to R-87366 (IC90 value was 0.5 microM). In experiments with this strain, R-87366 showed comparatively low efficacy in acutely infected peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC). This result suggests that the diversity of sensitivity shown in the ex vivo assay could be caused by the viral property itself. As a result of the determination of nucleic acid sequences in the clinical isolates, some amino acids were found to be substituted in the protease region, in contrast to the HIV-1 clade B consensus sequence, and some of them have been reported to contribute to the susceptibility of HIV protease inhibitors.",

In the PAG and VM, SCH-32615 resulted in a dose-dependent increase in HP and TF response latencies over a dose range of 1-30 micrograms with the ED50 values (micrograms) being PAG-TF = 17; PAG-HP = 11; VM-TF = 7; VM-HP = 6. In the AM, dose-dependent increases were only observed on the HP. (ED50 (micrograms) HP = 17). Peak effects were observed within 10 min and response latencies remained elevated for 45-60 min. Injections of SCH-32615 at sites outside of the PAG or VM were considerably less effective. All antinociceptive effects were antagonized by naloxone (1 mg/kg, i.p.). Twenty-four hours following the microinjection of beta-funaltrexamine (an irreversible opioid antagonist) into the PAG or the VM, the effects of SCH-32615 in the PAG were virtually abolished while in the VM, its effects were only moderately reduced. These data suggest that in the presence of a strong thermal stimulus, the behavioral response is subject to a tonically active or stimulus-evoked modulation by the local release in the PAG, VM and AM of an agent, presumably an enkephalin peptide, the degradation of which is altered by enkephalinase inhibition.",

        "abstract": "The interaction between the AT1 receptor-selective antagonist valsartan, and its human receptor, was investigated by direct radioligand binding as well as by its inhibition of angiotensin II induced inositol phosphate accumulation in CHO cells expressing human recombinant AT1 receptors. Specific binding of [3H]-valsartan rapidly reached equilibrium at 37 degrees C. It was saturable and occurred to a homogeneous class of sites with a K(D) of 0.88+/-0.076. It was inhibited by other AT1 receptor antagonists with the same potency order as previously described for the binding of [3H]-angiotensin II and [3H]-candesartan to human AT1 receptors (i.e. candesartan &gt; or = EXP3174 &gt; valsartan = irbesartan = angiotensin II &gt; losartan). When valsartan and angiotensin II were applied simultaneously to the CHO-AT1 cells. the antagonist caused a rightward shift of the angiotensin II concentration response curve. Hence, valsartan interacts with the AT1 receptor in a manner that is competitive with angiotensin II. Pre-incubation of the cells with 0.5, 5 and 50 nM valsartan caused an additional, concentration-dependent, up to 55% decline of the maximal response. The partial nature of this insurmountable inhibition by valsartan was confirmed by biphasic antagonist concentration-inhibition curves. These data reflect the co-existence of a fast reversible/surmountable as well as a tight binding/insurmountable valsartan receptor complex. In agreement, pre-incubation of the CHO-AT1 cells with 5 and 50 nM valsartan produced a partial inhibition of the angiotensin II induced increase of the free intracellular calcium concentration. [3H]-Valsartan dissociated from its receptors with a half-life of 17 min. In functional recovery experiments with valsartan-pre-treated cells, the angiotensin II-mediated response was half-maximally restored within approximately 30 min. These kinetic data suggest that the insurmountable inhibition by valsartan is related to its relatively slow dissociation from the human AT1 receptors.",

        "abstract": "The involvement of vasopressin (AVP) in several pathological states has been reported recently and the selective blockade of the different AVP receptors could offer new clinical perspectives. During the past few years, various selective, orally active AVP V1a (OPC-21268, SR49059 (Relcovaptan)), V2 (OPC-31260, OPC-41061 (Tolvaptan), VPA-985 (Lixivaptan), SR121463, VP-343, FR-161282) and mixed V1a/V2 (YM-087 (Conivaptan), JTV-605, CL-385004) receptor antagonists have been intensively studied in various animal models and have reached, Phase IIb clinical trials for some of them. For many years now, our laboratory has focused on the identification of nonpeptide vasopressin antagonists with suitable oral bioavailability. Using random screening on small molecule libraries, followed by rational SAR and modelization, we identified a chemical series of 1-phenylsulfonylindolines which first yielded SR49059, a V1a receptor antagonist prototype. This compound displayed high affinity for animal and human V1a receptors and antagonized various V1a AVP-induced effects in vitro and in vivo (intracellular [Ca2+] increase, platelet aggregation, vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, hypertension and coronary vasospasm). We and others have used this compound to study the role of AVP in various animal models. Recent findings from clinical trials show a potential interest for SR49059 in the treatment of dysmenorrhea and in Raynaud's disease. Structural modifications and simplifications performed in the SR49059 chemical series yielded highly specific V2 receptor antagonists (N-arylsulfonyl-oxindoles), amongst them SR121463 which possesses powerful oral aquaretic properties in various animal species and in man. SR121463 is well-tolerated and dose-dependently increases urine output and decreases urine osmolality. It induces free water-excretion without affecting electrolyte balance in contrast to classical diuretics (e.g. furosemide and hydrochlorothiazide). Notably, in cirrhotic rats with ascites and impaired renal function, a 10-day oral treatment with SR121463 (0.5 mg/kg) totally corrected hyponatremia and restored normal urine excretion. This compound also displayed interesting new properties in a rabbit model of ocular hypertension, decreasing intraocular pressure after single or repeated instillation. Thus, V2 receptor blockade could be of interest in several water-retaining diseases such as the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion (SIADH), liver cirrhosis and congestive heart failure and deserves to be widely explored. Finally, further chemical developments in the oxindole family have led to the first specific and orally active V1b receptor antagonists (with SSR149415 as a representative), an awaited class of drugs with expected therapeutic interest mainly in ACTH-secreting tumors and various emotional diseases such as stress-related disorders, anxiety and depression. However, from the recently described tissue localization for this receptor, we could also speculate on other unexpected uses. In conclusion, the development of AVP receptor antagonists is a field of intensive pharmacological and clinical investigation. Selective and orally active compounds are now available to give new insight into the pathophysiological role of AVP and to provide promising drugs.",

The histamine receptor 4 (H(4)R) is the most recently identified histamine receptor and is also expressed on human CD4(+) T cells; however, its regulation and function are unclear. OBJECTIVE: To investigate expression, regulation, and function of the H(4)R on human CD4(+) T cells. METHODS: Histamine receptor 4 expression was studied by real-time quantitative RT-PCR and by flow cytometry. Effects of H(4)R stimulation on induction of the signal transduction molecules activator protein 1 (AP-1) and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) were determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and on cytokine production by RT-PCR and ELISA. RESULTS: Histamine receptor 4 mRNA and protein were expressed by CD4(+) T cells and upregulated by IL-4. Its expression was higher on T(H)2 cells than T(H)1 cells and naive T-cells. H(4)R agonists (clobenpropit and 4-methylhistamine) induced AP-1 in T(H)2 cells but not in T(H)1 cells. This effect was blocked by the H(4)R antagonist JNJ7777120. H(4)R agonists upregulated IL-31 mRNA in PBMCs and T(H)2 cells, a cytokine that has been associated with T(H)2 cells and the induction of pruritus. IL-31 mRNA induction by H(4)R stimulation was pronounced in PBMCs from patients with atopic dermatitis. Expression of IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 was not altered by the H(4)R. CONCLUSION: Human CD4(+) T cells express a functional H(4)R. The receptor is upregulated under T(H)2 conditions, and its stimulation leads to induction of AP-1 and IL-31.",

With the exception of a few malignancies, seemingly driven by a single genetic mutation in a signaling protein, most tumors are the product of multiple mutations in multiple aberrant signaling pathways. Consequently, simultaneous targeted inhibition of multiple signaling pathways could be more effective than inhibiting a single pathway in cancer therapies. Such a multitargeted strategy has recently been validated in a number of preclinical and clinical studies using RTK inhibitors with broad target selectivity. SU14813, a small molecule identified from the same chemical library used to isolate sunitinib, has broad-spectrum RTK inhibitory activity through binding to and inhibition of VEGFR, PDGFR, KIT, and FLT3. In cellular assays, SU14813 inhibited ligand-dependent and ligand-independent proliferation, migration, and survival of endothelial cells and/or tumor cells expressing these targets. SU14813 inhibited VEGFR-2, PDGFR-beta, and FLT3 phosphorylation in xenograft tumors in a dose- and time-dependent fashion. The plasma concentration required for in vivo target inhibition was estimated to be 100 to 200 ng/mL. Used as monotherapy, SU14813 exhibited broad and potent antitumor activity resulting in regression, growth arrest, or substantially reduced growth of various established xenografts derived from human or rat tumor cell lines. Treatment in combination with docetaxel significantly enhanced both the inhibition of primary tumor growth and the survival of the tumor-bearing mice compared with administration of either agent alone. In summary, SU14813 inhibited target RTK activity in vivo in association with reduction in angiogenesis, target RTK-mediated proliferation, and survival of tumor cells, leading to broad and potent antitumor efficacy. These data support the ongoing phase I clinical evaluation of SU14813 in advanced malignancies.",

        "abstract": "Known treatments of type 2 diabetes mellitus have limitations such as weight gain, and hypoglycaemias. A new perspective is the use of incretin hormones and incretin enhancers. Incretins are defined as being responsible for the higher insulin release after an oral glucose load compared to an intravenous glucose load. The delicate balance of glucose homeostasis, in which incretin hormones are involved, is disturbed in type 2 diabetes mellitus. The incretin GLP-1 helps to maintain glucose homeostasis through stimulation of insulin secretion and inhibition of glucagon release in a glucose-dependent manner. This is associated with reductions in body weight, and no risk of hypoglycaemias. When classical oral agents have failed to maintain adequate glycaemic control, incretin mimetics may be of particular value for obese patients and those who have little control over meal sizes. Exenatide was marketed as a GLP-1 analogue and longer acting incretin mimetics such as liraglutide, albiglutide and others have the same pharmacological profile. In addition to incretin mimetics incretin enhancers which inhibit/delay degradation of incretins were developed: so-called DPP-4 inhibitors such as sitagliptin and vildagliptin are approved in Europe. Their differences from incretin mimetics include: oral bioavailability, less side effects with overdose, no direct CNS effects (nausea and vomiting) and no effect on weight. In rodent models of diabetes, but not yet in humans, GLP-1 receptor agonists and DPP-4 inhibitors increase islet mass and preserve beta-cell function. Incretin mimetics and enhancers expand type 2 diabetes treatment, are still not first line therapy and it is discussed if they are to be prophylactically used.",

[3H]7-OH-DPAT binding to human peripheral blood lymphocytes was time-, temperature-, and concentration-dependent and of high affinity with a dissociation constant value (Kd) of 0.27 +/- 0.05 nM and a maximum binding density (Bmax) of 14.7 +/- 0.06 fmol/2 x 10(6) cells. Binding was also reversible. The rank order of potency of displacers of [3H]7-OH-DPAT binding to human peripheral blood lymphocytes resembled that found for dopamine D3 receptor in rat brain homogenates or in rat or human cell lines. Our findings, which are consistent with those of other authors performed with molecular biology techniques, suggest that human peripheral blood lymphocytes express dopamine D3 receptor. In the brain, dopamine D3 receptor probably mediates the anti-psychotic effect of neuroleptics.

        "abstract": "AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Increased glucagon secretion predicts deterioration of glucose tolerance, and high glucagon levels contribute to hyperglycaemia in type 2 diabetes. Inhibition of glucagon action may therefore be a potential novel target to reduce hyperglycaemia. Here, we investigated whether chronic treatment with a glucagon receptor antagonist (GRA) improves islet dysfunction in female mice on a high-fat diet (HFD). MATERIALS AND METHODS: After 8 weeks of HFD, mice were treated with a small molecule GRA (300 mg/kg, gavage once daily) for up to 30 days. Insulin secretion was studied after oral and intravenous administration of glucose and glucagon secretion after intravenous arginine. Islet morphology was examined and insulin secretion and glucose oxidation were measured in isolated islets. RESULTS: Fasting plasma glucose levels were reduced by GRA (6.0 +/- 0.2 vs 7.4 +/- 0.5 mmol/l; p = 0.017). The acute insulin response to intravenous glucose was augmented (1,300 +/- 110 vs 790 +/- 64 pmol/l; p &lt; 0.001). The early insulin response to oral glucose was reduced in mice on HFD + GRA (1,890 +/- 160 vs 3,040 +/- 420 pmol/l; p = 0.012), but glucose excursions were improved. Intravenous arginine significantly increased the acute glucagon response (129 +/- 12 vs 36 +/- 6 ng/l in controls; p &lt; 0.01), notably without affecting plasma glucose. GRA caused a modest increase in alpha cell mass, while beta cell mass was similar to that in mice on HFD + vehicle. Isolated islets displayed improved glucose-stimulated insulin secretion after GRA treatment (0.061 +/- 0.007 vs 0.030 +/- 0.004 pmol islet(-1) h(-1) at 16.7 mmol/l glucose; p &lt; 0.001), without affecting islet glucose oxidation. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Chronic glucagon receptor antagonism in HFD-fed mice improves islet sensitivity to glucose and increases insulin secretion, suggesting improvement of key defects underlying impaired glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes.",

        "abstract": "The G protein coupled oxytocin receptor (OTR) reveals some specific molecular and physiological characteristics. Ligand-receptor interaction has been analysed by photoaffinity labelling, site-directed mutagenesis, the construction of receptor chimeras and molecular modelling. Major results of these studies will be summarized. The N-terminus of the OTR is mainly involved in agonist binding. Notably, antagonists that are derived from the ground structure of oxytocin, bind the receptor at distinct sites partly non-overlapping with the agonist binding site. OTRs are able to couple to different G proteins, with a subsequent stimulation of phospholipase C-beta isoforms. In dependence on G protein coupling, OTRs can transduce growth-inhibitory or proliferatory signals. Some evidence is provided that OTRs are also present in form of dimeric or oligomeric complexes at the cell surface. The affinity of the receptor for ligands is strongly dependent on the presence of divalent cations (Mg(2+)) and cholesterol that both act like positive allosteric modulators. While the high-affinity state of the receptor for agonists requires divalent cations and cholesterol, the high-affinity state for antagonists is only dependent on a sufficient amount of cholesterol. Cholesterol affects ligand-binding affinity, receptor signalling and stability. Since the purification of the OTR has never been achieved, alternative methods to study the receptor in its native environment are necessary. Promising strategies for the site-specific labelling of the OTR will be presented. The employment of diverse reporter molecules introduced at different positions within the OTR might allow us in the near future to measure conformational changes of the receptor in its native lipid environment.",

        "abstract": "Bleomycin (BLM) is a glycopeptide anticancer drug that effectively carries out single- and double-stranded DNA cleavage. Activated BLM (ABLM), a low-spin ferric-hydroperoxide, BLM-Fe(III)-OOH, is the last intermediate detected before DNA cleavage. We have previously shown through experiments and DFT calculations that both ABLM decay and reaction with H atom donors proceed via direct H atom abstraction. However, the rate of ABLM decay had been previously found, based on indirect methods, to be independent of the presence of DNA. In this study, we use a circular dichroism (CD) feature unique to ABLM to directly monitor the kinetics of ABLM reaction with a DNA oligonucleotide. Our results show that the ABLM + DNA reaction is appreciably faster, has a different kinetic isotope effect, and has a lower Arrhenius activation energy than does ABLM decay. In the ABLM reaction with DNA, the small normal k(H)/k(D) ratio is attributed to a secondary solvent effect through DFT vibrational analysis of reactant and transition state (TS) frequencies, and the lower E(a) is attributed to the weaker bond involved in the abstraction reaction (C-H for DNA and N-H for the decay in the absence of DNA). The DNA dependence of the ABLM reaction indicates that DNA is involved in the TS for ABLM decay and thus reacts directly with BLM-Fe(III)-OOH instead of its decay product.",

        "abstract": "We assessed the effects of tramadol, a centrally acting analgesic, and its major metabolite, on neurotransmitter-gated ion channels. Tramadol binds to mu-opioid receptors with low affinity and inhibits reuptake of monoamines in the central nervous system. These actions are believed to primarily contribute to its antinociceptive effects. However, little is known about other sites of tramadol's action. We tested the effects of tramadol and its M1 metabolite (0.1-100 microM) on human recombinant neurotransmitter-gated ion channels, including glycine, gamma-aminobutyric acid(A) (GABA(A)), and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Tramadol and M1 metabolite did not have any effects on glycine receptors. GABA(A) receptors were significantly inhibited only at large concentrations (100 microM). NMDA receptors were inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner. Tramadol and M1 metabolite inhibited the glutamate-concentration response curve without changing the half-maximal effective concentration or the Hill coefficient, indicating a noncompetitive inhibition. This study suggests that glycine receptors do not provide the antinociceptive effect of tramadol and that the inhibition of GABA(A) receptors at large concentration might correlate with convulsions. The inhibitory effect on NMDA receptors may contribute to the antinociceptive effect of tramadol at relatively large concentrations.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: There is increasing evidence that not only the monoaminergic but also the glutamatergic system is involved in the pathophysiology of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Hyperactivity of glutamate metabolism might be causally related to a hypoactive state in the dopaminergic system. Atomoxetine, a selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor, is the first non-stimulant approved for the treatment of this disorder. Here we have evaluated the effects of atomoxetine on glutamate receptors in vitro. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: The whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique was used to analyse the effect of atomoxetine on N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in cultured rodent cortical and hippocampal neurons as well as on NMDA receptors heterologously expressed in human TsA cells. KEY RESULTS: Atomoxetine blocked NMDA-induced membrane currents. Half-maximal inhibition emerged at about 3 microM which is in the range of clinically relevant concentrations found in plasma of patients treated with this drug. The inhibition was voltage-dependent, indicating an open-channel blocking mechanism. Furthermore, the inhibitory potency of atomoxetine did not vary when measured on NMDA receptors from different brain regions or with different subunit compositions. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The effective NMDA receptor antagonism by atomoxetine at low micromolar concentrations may be relevant to its clinical effects in the treatment of ADHD. Our data provide further evidence that altered glutamatergic transmission might play a role in ADHD pathophysiology.",

In the present work, we have studied the ontogeny of the steady-state GnRH-R mRNA levels in pituitaries of female rats from Day 5 to Day 55, when sexual maturity is attained. Developmental changes of gonadotropin subunit (alpha, FSHbeta, and LHbeta) mRNA levels were also assessed. In addition, the role of the endogenous GnRH on the maturational changes of GnRH-R and gonadotropin subunit gene expression was investigated. Messenger RNA levels were determined by Northern blot analysis of total RNA from anterior pituitaries. Amounts of the most abundant (5.0 kilobase [kb]) GnRH-R mRNA increased slowly from Day 5 through the infantile period, to peak at Day 20 ( approximately 4-fold increase vs. Day 5). Thereafter the levels of the GnRH-R mRNA decline abruptly by Day 25 (75% decrease vs. Day 20) and then fell slightly until Day 35. Parallel changes were observed on the 4.5-kb transcript of the GnRH-R gene. Alpha subunit mRNA was easily detected at Day 5 and its levels increased quickly through the beginning of the infantile period to peak at Day 10 (3.2-fold increase vs. Day 5); then it decreased by 85% at Day 35. FSHbeta and LHbeta mRNA levels rose slowly until Days 15-20, a short time before GnRH-R. Thereafter, the levels of both mRNAs fell until Day 35 (90% decrease vs. Day 15 for FSHbeta and 50% decrease vs. Day 20 for LHbeta). To ascertain whether developmental activation of the GnRH-R and gonadotropin subunit gene expression is GnRH dependent, we have studied the effect of blocking the endogenous GnRH action by treating developing female rats with the specific GnRH antagonist cetrorelix (1.5 mg/kg body weight/wk, s.c.) through the infantile (Days 5-20) and the juvenile period (Days 20-35). Cetrorelix completely blocked the rise of levels of the two most abundant species, 5.0 kb and 4.5 kb, of GnRH-R mRNA during the infantile phase and dropped them to almost undetectable levels during the juvenile prepubertal period. Cetrorelix also abolished the developmental rise of gonadotropin beta subunit mRNAs during the two periods of the study. In contrast, alpha subunit gene expression tended to decrease, but not significantly, with cetrorelix treatment during the two periods. These data demonstrate that sexual maturation of female rats is advanced by an early and strong induction of GnRH-R and gonadotropin subunit gene expression during the infantile period, followed by weaker persistent activation during puberty. Developmental GnRH-R and gonadotropin beta subunit gene expression is almost entirely GnRH dependent, not only in the juvenile prepubertal stage but also during the infantile period.",

Although low concentrations exhibit only a partially inhibitory effect, high concentrations may completely block ergosterol synthesis. Reduction of fungal growth and inhibition of growth and fungicidal action during prolonged incubation are the corresponding effects at the cellular level that are a consequence of ergosterol depletion. The inoculum effect, the influence of the incubation period, and the influence of nutrient media, three factors that often complicate susceptibility testing in vitro, can also be explained by the mode of action of azole compounds. Another interesting characteristic of azole antifungals was revealed by the observation that hyphae and pseudomycelia of Candida albicans are much more susceptible to azoles than are yeast cells. Even 1% of the minimum inhibitory concentration of clotrimazole may totally inhibit mycelial growth in vitro. This may be of clinical importance, since germination was reported to enhance adherence of C. albicans to buccal and vaginal epithelial cells.",

Nelfinavir and lopinavir/ritonavir-based therapies have been widely used in the treatment of HIV-infected patients, in combination with reverse transcriptase inhibitors. The aim of this observational study was the identification and characterization of mutations or combinations of mutations associated with resistance to nelfinavir and lopinavir/ritonavir in treated patients. Nucleotide sequences of 1,515 subtype B HIV-1 isolates from 1,313 persons with different treatment histories (including naive and treated patients) were collected in 31 Spanish hospitals over the years 2002-2005. Chi-square contingency tests were performed to detect mutations associated with failure to protease inhibitor-based therapies, and correlated mutations were identified using statistical methods. Virological failure to nelfinavir was associated with two different mutational pathways. D30N and N88D appeared mostly in patients without previous exposure to protease inhibitors, while K20T was identified as a secondary resistance mutation in those patients. On the other hand, L90M together with L10I, I54V, A71V, G73S, and V82A were selected in protease inhibitor-experienced patients. A series of correlated mutations including L10I, M46I, I54V, A71V, G73S, and L90M appeared as a common cluster of amino acid substitutions, associated with failure to lopinavir/ritonavir-based treatments. Despite the relatively high genetic barrier of some protease inhibitors, a relatively small cluster of mutations, previously selected under drug pressure, can seriously compromise the efficiency of nelfinavir- and lopinavir/ritonavir-based therapies.",

Despite remarkable responses in the treatment of acute myeloid leukemias in the 1970s no earlier than 2004 has this agent been approved by the US FDA for the treatment of all subtypes of myelodysplatic syndromes (MDS). For the first time a drug was proven to alter the natural course of MDS, as demonstrated in three clinical trials conducted by the CALG B. Complete remission rates ranged between 10-17%, and more recently, a significant survival benefit for MDS patients treated with 5-Azacytidine could be established. The antineoplastic activity is due to incorporation into RNA with disruption of RNA metabolism, and inhibition of DNA methylation.Strategies of combining epigenetic manipulation with other 'new' drugs aim at increasing the efficacy of the hypomethylating agents. Particularly histone deacetylase inhibitors have been deemed useful therapeutic partners, and preliminary results are promising.",

        "abstract": "We characterised histamine H(1) receptor antagonism by cetirizine and its enantiomers on isolated guinea pig ileum and trachea. Competitive or mixed (competitive and apparent noncompetitive) antagonism profiles were observed. The order of potency was: chlorpheniramine&gt; or =mepyramine&gt;levocetirizine&gt;cetirizine&gt; or =terfenadine&gt;loratadine&gt;dextrocetirizine. The inhibitory effects of cetirizine, levocetirizine, terfenadine and loratadine were slowly reversible compared to those of dextrocetirizine or mepyramine. Cetirizine and its enantiomers were inactive on L-type Ca(2+) channels. Reduction of the histamine H(1) receptor reserve by dibenamine in the ileum (100-fold higher than in the trachea) showed a gradual change from the competitive profile of dextrocetirizine and mepyramine to a mixed profile. The present results show that cetirizine and levocetirizine are selective competitive but slowly reversible histamine H(1) receptor antagonists. Their mixed antagonism profile observed in the trachea can be explained by the small receptor reserve present in this tissue compared to the ileum and their very slow dissociation rate from the histamine H(1) receptor.",

Cycloserine acts as a suicide inhibitor of alanine racemase and as such, serves as an antimicrobial agent. The chemical means by which cycloserine inhibits alanine racemase is unknown. Through spectroscopic assays, we show here evidence of a pyridoxal derivative (arising from either isomer of cycloserine) saturated at the C4' carbon position. We additionally report the L- and D-cycloserine inactivated crystal structures of Bacillus stearothermophilus alanine racemase, which corroborates the spectroscopy via evidence of a 3-hydroxyisoxazole pyridoxamine derivative. Upon the basis of the kinetic and structural properties of both the L- and D-isomers of the inhibitor, we propose a mechanism of alanine racemase inactivation by cycloserine. This pathway involves an initial transamination step followed by tautomerization to form a stable aromatic adduct, a scheme similar to that seen in cycloserine inactivation of aminotransferases.",

Nitisinone, an inhibitor of the enzyme 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase, can drastically reduce urinary excretion of HGA in individuals with alkaptonuria. We investigated the safety and the HGA-depleting efficacy of nitisinone in an open-label, single-center study of 9 alkaptonuria patients (5 women, 4 men; 35-69 years of age) over the course of 3 to 4 months. Each patient received nitisinone in incremental doses, 0.35 mg bid followed by 1.05 mg bid, and remained on this dosage and a regular diet for 3 months. Nitisinone reduced urinary HGA levels from an average of 4.0 +/- 1.8 (SD) g/day to 0.2 +/- 0.2 g/day ( P &lt; .001). The average plasma tyrosine concentration, initially 68 +/- 18 mmicro mol/L, rose to 760 +/- 181 micro mol/L ( P &lt; .001). During the final week of the study, 5 patients adhered to a protein-restricted diet (40 g/day), and their mean plasma tyrosine level fell from 755 +/- 167 to 603 +/- 114 mu mol/L. Six of the 7 patients who received nitisinone for more than 1 week reported decreased pain in their affected joints. Weekly ophthalmologic examinations showed no signs of corneal toxicity. Adverse events included the passing of kidney stones, the recognition of symptoms related to aortic stenosis, and elevation of liver transaminase levels. We conclude that low-dose nitisinone effectively reduced urinary HGA levels in patients with alkaptonuria. Future long-term clinical trials are planned to determine the benefits of nitisinone in preventing joint deterioration and providing pain relief, and its long-term side effects.",

        "abstract": "Alkaptonuria is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of metabolism caused by deficiency of homogentisic acid oxidase and resulting in accumulation of homogentisic acid in collagenous structures. It is characterized by homogentisic aciduria, bluish-black discoloration of connective tissues (ochronosis) and arthropathy of large joints. Less common manifestations include cardiovascular abnormalities, renal, urethral and prostate calculi. Bone fractures are unusual in ochronosis. In this report, we describe a woman, 69 years of age, with a history of dark urine since childhood and progressive pigmentation of the skin, sclera, and auricular cartilages. She had severe arthropathy requiring total joint replacement in both of her knees and right hip. She also had severe aortic stenosis requiring valve replacement, and asymptomatic nephrolithiasis. She presented with a low trauma fracture of the distal femur despite two years of alendroate therapy. We review the etiology, pathogenesis, clinical presentation, diagnosis and treatment of alkaptonuric ochronosis. Early detection is important for prevention and treatment of multiple systems. Nitisinone, a potent inhibitor of 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase, dramatically reduces production and urinary excretion of homogentisic acid; however, the long-term efficacy and side effects of such therapy are unknown. Identifying the gene for alkaptonuria offers the potential for a new therapeutic approach (replacement therapy with a recombinant enzyme) in the treatment of alkaptonuric ochronosis.",

        "abstract": "Appropriate expression of the GnRH receptor (GnRH-R) in gonadotropes is critical for GnRH signaling and hence for gonadotropin secretion and sexual development. In the present work, we have studied the ontogeny of the steady-state GnRH-R mRNA levels in pituitaries of male rats from Day 5 to Day 55, when sexual maturity is attained. Developmental changes of gonadotropin subunit (alpha, FSHbeta, and LHbeta) mRNA levels were also assessed. In addition, the role of the endogenous GnRH on the maturational changes of GnRH-R and gonadotropin subunit gene expression was investigated. Messenger RNA levels were determined by Northern blot analysis of total RNA from anterior pituitaries. Amounts of the most abundant (5.0 kb) GnRH-R mRNA increased slowly from Day 5 through the infantile and the juvenile periods, to peak at Day 35 (12-fold increase vs. Day 5). Thereafter, the levels of the GnRH-R mRNA decline slightly until Day 55 (33% decrease vs. Day 35). Parallel changes were observed on the 4.5-kb transcript of the GnRH-R gene. Alpha subunit mRNA was easily detected at Day 5, and its levels increased progressively through the infantile period (2.5-fold increase) and peaked at Day 25 (3.3-fold increase vs. Day 5) with a smooth nonstatistically significant increment until Day 35; then it decreased by 41.5% at Day 55. FSHbeta and LHbeta mRNA levels rose slowly until Day 25. A sharp rise occurred thereafter to reach maximum levels at Day 35 (5.8-fold for FSHbeta and 3.8-fold for LHbeta vs. Day 25). Thereafter, the levels of both mRNAs fell until Day 55 (44.1% decrease for FSHbeta and 37.1% decrease for LHbeta vs. Day 35). To ascertain whether developmental activation of the GnRH-R and gonadotropin subunit gene expression is GnRH dependent, we have studied the effect of blocking the endogenous GnRH action by treating developing male rats with the specific GnRH antagonist cetrorelix (1.5 mg/kg body weight/week, s.c.) through the infantile (Days 5-20) and the juvenile periods (Days 20-35). Cetrorelix completely blocked the rise of levels of the two most abundant species, 5.0 kb and 4.5 kb, of the GnRH-R mRNA, during both the infantile and the juvenile periods. Cetrorelix also abolished the developmental rise of the gonadotropin beta subunit mRNAs during the two periods of the study. In contrast, the alpha subunit gene expression was not altered by cetrorelix treatment during any of the two periods. These data demonstrate that sexual maturation of male rats is accompanied by a progressive and concerted induction of GnRH-R and gonadotropin subunit gene expression. Developmental activation of GnRH-R and gonadotropin beta subunit genes is GnRH dependent. The apparent GnRH-independent regulation of the alpha-glycoprotein subunit mRNA levels may be due to the contribution of thyrotropes and perhaps to the presence of exclusive regulatory signals for this gene.",

        "abstract": "Tyrosinase usually catalyzes the conversion of monophenols to o-diphenols and oxidation of diphenols to the corresponding quinones. However, when 3,4-dihydroxymandelic acid was provided as the substrate, it catalyzed an unusual oxidative decarboxylation reaction generating 3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde as the sole product. The identity of the product was confirmed by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) as well as ultraviolet and infrared spectral studies. None of the following enzymes tested catalyzed the new reaction: galactose oxidase, ceruloplasmin, superoxide dismutase, ascorbate oxidase, dopamine beta-hydroxylase, and peroxidase. Phenol oxidase inhibitors such as phenylthiourea, potassium cyanide, and sodium azide inhibited the reaction drastically, suggesting the participation of the active site copper of the enzyme in the catalysis. Mimosine, a well-known competitive inhibitor of tyrosinase, competitively inhibited the new reaction also. 4-Hydroxymandelic acid and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxymandelic acid neither served as substrates nor inhibited the reaction. Putative intermediates such as 3,4-dihydroxybenzyl alcohol and (3,4-dihydroxybenzoyl)formic acid did not accumulate during the reaction. Oxidation to a quinone methide derivative rather than conventional quinone accounts for this unusual oxidative decarboxylation reaction. Earlier from this laboratory, we reported the conversion of 4-alkylcatechols to quinone methides catalyzed by a cuticular phenol oxidase [Sugumaran, M., &amp; Lipke, H. (1983) FEBS Lett. 155, 65-68]. Present studies demonstrate that mushroom tyrosinase will also catalyze quinone methide production with the same active site copper if a suitable substrate such as 3,4-dihydroxymandelic acid is provided.",

The immediate phase reaction (IPR) assessed at 1 hour after antigen application was significantly inhibited by all antihistamines examined. The inhibition of IPR by cetirizine and mequitazine were potent, but those by cyproheptadine and diphenhydramine were weak. The later phase reaction (LPR) assessed at 24 hours after antigen application was inhibited by chlorpheniramine, oxatomide, ketotifen, mequitazine, emedastine, terfenadine and azelastine. The inhibition of LPR by emedastine was potent, but those by ketotifen and terfenadine were only partial. Emedastine inhibited both IPR and LPR comparably. Present results indicate that H1 receptor activation is involved in the IPR of the biphasic cutaneous reaction, and that the blockade of H1 receptors at IPR does not contribute to the attenuation of following LPR. Histamine H1 receptor antagonists inhibiting the LPR have a property distinct from H1 receptor antagonism, which may have an additional benefit for the treatment of allergic diseases.",

Their activity has been attributed mainly to their intercalation between the base pairs of native DNA. Complex formation between daunorubicin or doxorubicin with polydeoxyribonucleotides and DNAs of various base composition or chromatins has been investigated by numerous techniques. Many authors have tried to correlate biological and therapeutic activities with the affinity of the drugs for DNA or some specific sequences of DNA. In vivo these anthracycline drugs cause DNA damage such as fragmentation and single-strand breaks. The mechanism of action of anthracyclines involves the inhibition of RNA and DNA syntheses. There exists two limiting factors in the use of anthracyclines as antitumoral agents: a chronic or acute cardiotoxicity and a spontaneous or acquired resistance. In both cases, there is probably an action at the membrane level. It has to be noted that daunorubicin and doxorubicin have a particular affinity for phospholipids and that the development of resistance is linked to some membrane alterations.",

        "abstract": "Phenylbutazone (PB), a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, is an efficient reducing cofactor for the peroxidase activity of prostaglandin H synthase (PHS). Most reducing cofactors for the peroxidase protect PHS and prostacyclin synthase from inactivation by hydroperoxides. PB, however, does not protect these enzymes, but rather augments their hydroperoxide-dependent inactivation. Using ram seminal vesicle microsomes as a source of PHS and prostacyclin synthase, we have examined the interaction of PB and exogenous hydroperoxides. Chromatographic analysis of the metabolism of 14C-labeled arachidonic acid in this system revealed that PB-dependent inactivation of PHS is markedly increased in the presence of 100 microM H2O2. This inactivation is a linear function of PB concentration between 10 and 250 microM, with a half-maximal effect in this range at about 100 microM PB. Prostacyclin synthase is even more sensitive to inactivation by the combined PB and H2O2 treatment, with a corresponding half-maximal effect at PB concentrations near 25 microM. This PB- and H2O2-dependent inactivation is demonstrable whether PGH2 is generated in situ from arachidonic acid or is added exogenously, supporting a direct effect of the treatment on prostacyclin synthase. As PB undergoes peroxide-dependent co-oxygenation catalyzed by PHS, we propose that it is an oxygenated derivative of PB, rather than the parent compound, which is responsible for the inactivation of PHS and prostacyclin synthase. Nafazatrom, a competitive inhibitor of PB co-oxygenation, blocks the effects of the PB and H2O2 treatment, supporting our proposal.",

        "abstract": "Myeloperoxidase (MPO) catalyzes the formation of potent oxidants that have been implicated in the pathogenesis of various diseases including atherosclerosis, asthma, arthritis, and cancer. Melatonin plays an important part in the regulation of various body functions including circadian sleep rhythms, blood pressure, oncogenesis, retinal function, seasonal reproduction, and immunity. Here, we demonstrate that melatonin serves as a potent inhibitor of MPO under physiological-like conditions. In the presence of chloride (Cl-), melatonin inactivated MPO at two points in the classic peroxidase cycle through binding to MPO to form an inactive complex, melatonin-MPO-Cl, and accelerating MPO compound II formation, an inactive form of MPO. Inactivation of MPO was mirrored by the direct conversion of MPO-Fe(III) to MPO compound II without any sign of compound I accumulation. This behavior indicates that melatonin binding modulates the formation of MPO intermediates and their decay rates. The Cl- presence enhanced the affinity of MPO toward melatonin, which switches the enzyme activity from peroxidation to catalase-like activity. In the absence of Cl-, melatonin served as a 1e- substrate for MPO compound I, but at higher concentration it limited the reaction by its dissociation from the corresponding complex. Importantly, melatonin-dependent inhibition of MPO occurred with a wide range of concentrations that span various physiological and supplemental ranges. Thus, the interplay between MPO and melatonin may have a broader implication in the function of several biological systems. This dual regulation by melatonin is unique and represents a new means through which melatonin can control MPO and its downstream inflammatory pathways.",

We report here that defined heparin oligosaccharides interact with the selectins. Heparin chains containing four or more monosaccharide residues inhibited the function of L- and P-selectin, but not E-selectin, in vitro. In a competition enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay measuring inhibition of solution-phase selectin-Ig fusion proteins (selectin-Ig) binding to immobilized bovine serum albumin-sLex neoglycoprotein, a heparin-derived tetrasaccharide mixture inhibited 50% of L- and P-selectin-Ig binding (IC50) at 200 +/- 40 mumol/L and 850 +/- 110 mumol/L, respectively. A single hexasulfated tetrasaccharide (delta UA2S alpha 1-4GlcNS6S alpha 1-4IdoA2S alpha 1-4GlcNS6S) was particularly active against L- and P-selectin-Ig (IC50 = 46 +/- 5 mumol/L and 341 +/- 24 mumol/L). By comparison, the tetrasaccharide sLex was not inhibitory at concentrations up to 1 mmol/L. In cell adhesion assays, heparin tetrasaccharides reduced binding of neutrophils to COS cells expressing P-selectin but not to COS cells expressing E-selectin. They also blocked colon cancer cell adhesion to L- and P-selectin but not E-selectin. In a model of acute inflammation, intravenously administered heparin tetrasaccharides diminished influx of neutrophils into the peritoneal cavities of thioglycollate-treated mice.

This is the first report of a selective, small molecule drug inhibitor of PTPase. Gallium nitrate did not inhibit CD45, a PTPase found in the membranes of hemopoietic lineage cells such as Jurkat cells.

Gallium nitrate and most of the gallium analogues penetrate poorly into cells. In contrast, a gallium-hydrogen peroxide complex inhibits DNA synthesis in Jurkat cells and induces the accumulation of phosphotyrosines on multiple intracellular proteins in this cell line. Gallium-hydrogen peroxide complex and gallium nitrate have similar inhibitory activity toward detergent-soluble PTPase. This is a new mechanism of action for gallium nitrate but it is not known if the inhibition of PTPase is related to the antitumor activity of gallium nitrate.",

The chronic contact hypersensitivity induced by repeated application of oxazolone was treated with olopatadine and other histamine H1 receptor antagonists at the effective doses on histamine-induced paw edema in mice. The effects of these drugs in the oxazolone-induced model were quantified by measurements of ear swelling, and levels of cytokines in the lesioned ear. Olopatadine significantly inhibited the ear swelling and the increased production of IL-4, IL-1beta, IL-6, GM-CSF and NGF in the lesioned ear. On the other hand, the other histamine H1 receptor antagonists did not significantly suppress the increase in ear thickness. Moreover, they did not affect the production of cytokines in the lesioned ear.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Airway remodeling and dysfunction are characteristic features of asthma thought to be caused by aberrant production of Th2 cytokines. Histamine H4 receptor (H4R) perturbation has previously been shown to modify acute inflammation and Th2 cytokine production in a murine model of asthma. We examined the ability of H4R antagonists to therapeutically modify the effects of Th2 cytokine production such as goblet cell hyperplasia (GCH), and collagen deposition in a sub-chronic model of asthma. In addition, effects on Th2 mediated lung dysfunction were also determined. METHODS: Mice were sensitized to ovalbumin (OVA) followed by repeated airway challenge with OVA. After inflammation was established mice were dosed with the H4R antagonist, JNJ 7777120, or anti-IL-13 antibody for comparison. Airway hyperreactivity (AHR) was measured, lungs lavaged and tissues collected for analysis. RESULTS: Therapeutic H4R antagonism inhibited T cell infiltration in to the lung and decreased Th2 cytokines IL-13 and IL-5. IL-13 dependent remodeling parameters such as GCH and lung collagen were reduced. Intervention with H4R antagonist also improved measures of central and peripheral airway dysfunction. CONCLUSIONS: These data demonstrate that therapeutic H4R antagonism can significantly ameliorate allergen induced, Th2 cytokine driven pathologies such as lung remodeling and airway dysfunction. The ability of H4R antagonists to affect these key manifestations of asthma suggests their potential as novel human therapeutics.",

        "title": "Mechanism of action in thalidomide teratogenesis.",
        "abstract": "In this commentary, we describe a model to explain the mechanism of the embryopathy of thalidomide. We propose that thalidomide affects the following pathway during development: insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF-2) stimulation of the transcription of alphav and beta3 integrin subunit genes. The resulting alphavbeta3 integrin dimer stimulates angiogenesis in the developing limb bud, which promotes outgrowth of the bud. The promoters of the IGF-I and FGF-2 genes, the genes for their binding proteins and receptors, as well as the alphav and beta3 genes, lack typical TATA boxes, but instead contain multiple GC boxes (GGGCGG). Thalidomide, or a breakdown product of thalidomide, specifically binds to these GC promoter sites, decreasing transcription efficiency of the associated genes. A cumulative decrease interferes with normal angiogenesis, which results in truncation of the limb. Intercalation into G-rich promoter regions of DNA may explain why certain thalidomide analogs are not teratogenic while retaining their anti-tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) activity, and suggests that we look elsewhere to explain the action of thalidomide on TNF-alpha. On the other hand, the anti-cancer action of thalidomide may be based on its antiangiogenic action, resulting from specific DNA intercalation. The tissue specificity of thalidomide and its effect against only certain neoplasias may be explained by the fact that various developing tissues and neoplasias depend on different angiogenesis or vasculogenesis pathways, only some of which are thalidomide-sensitive.",

        "abstract": "Metabolites of the analogue 1-deamino-1-carba-2-tyrosine(O-methyl)-oxytocin (carbetocin) following incubation with a rat kidney homogenate were isolated and their pharmacodynamic properties investigated. Apart from the parent compound two metabolites were identified namely desGlyNH2-carbetocin (carbetocin metabolite I) and desLeuGlyNH2-carbetocin (carbetocin metabolite II). Both carbetocin, carbetocin metabolite I and carbetocin metabolite II displayed binding affinities to the myometrial oxytocin receptor of a similar magnitude as oxytocin. Carbetocin was found to have agonistic properties on isolated myometrial strips and it was found to exert this effect through generation of inositol phosphates, as is the case for oxytocin. However, maximal contractile effect of carbetocin was approximately 50% lower than that of oxytocin (2.70 +/- 0.12 g compared to 5.22 +/- 0.26 g) and EC50 was approximately ten times higher (48.0 +/- 8.20 nM compared to 5.62 +/- 1.22 nM). Neither carbetocin metabolite I nor carbetocin metabolite II were able to contract isolated myometrial tissue. All three compounds displayed antagonistic properties against oxytocin in vitro, with carbetocin being the strongest inhibitor (pA2 = 8.21) and carbetocin metabolite II (pA2 = 8.01) being stronger than carbetocin metabolite I (pA2 = 7.81). These results indicate that carbetocin is a partial agonist/antagonist to the oxytocin receptor while the two metabolites carbetocin metabolite I and carbetocin metabolite II are pure antagonists. All three analogues bound to the myometrial vasopressin V1 receptor, albeit with much lower affinities than to the oxytocin receptor. Carbetocin metabolite II showed the weakest binding affinity of 33.7 +/- 7.34 nM compared to 7.24 +/- 0.29 nM for carbetocin and 9.89 + 2.80 nM for carbetocin metabolite I. Only carbetocin bound to the renal vasopressin V2 receptor though the binding affinity was very low (61.3 +/- 14.6 nM).",

        "abstract": "1. The effects of phentolamine and yohimbine on adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP)-sensitive K+ channels were studied in normal mouse beta-cells. 2. In the presence of 3 mM glucose, many ATP-sensitive K+ channels are open in the beta-cell membrane. Under these conditions, phentolamine inhibited 86Rb efflux from the islets. This inhibition was faster with 100 than with 20 microM phentolamine but its steady-state magnitude was similar with both concentrations. Yohimbine (20-100 microM) also inhibited the efflux rate but was not as potent as phentolamine. 3. In the presence of 6 mM glucose, most ATP-sensitive K+ channels are closed in the beta-cell membrane. Their opening by 100 microM diazoxide caused a marked acceleration of 86Rb efflux from the islets. This acceleration was almost entirely prevented by 20 microM phentolamine. It was barely affected by 20 microM yohimbine and reduced by 50% by 100 microM yohimbine. 4. ATP-sensitive K+ currents were studied in single beta-cells by the whole cell patch-clamp technique. Phentolamine (20-100 microM) caused a progressive but almost complete and irreversible inhibition of the current. The effects of yohimbine were faster but smaller; the inhibition was still incomplete with 100 microM yohimbine. 5. The increase in ATP-sensitive K+ current produced by 100 microM diazoxide was prevented by 100 microM phentolamine but only partially attenuated by 100 microM yohimbine. 6. It is concluded that phentolamine inhibits ATP-sensitive K+ channels in pancreatic beta-cells. This novel effect of phentolamine resembles that of hypoglycaemic sulphonylureas. It may account for previously unexplained effects of the drug. These observations also call for reinterpretation of many studies in which phentolamine was used as an allegedly specific blocker of alpha-adrenoceptors.",

In the current study, the effects of PRX-08066 were assessed by using the monocrotaline (MCT)-induced PAH rat model. Male rats received 40 mg/kg MCT or phosphate-buffered saline and were treated orally twice a day with vehicle or 50 or 100 mg/kg PRX-08066 for 5 weeks. Pulmonary and cardiac functions were evaluated by hemodynamics, heart weight, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), pulmonary artery (PA) morphology, and histology. Cardiac MRI demonstrated that PRX-08066 (100 mg/kg) significantly (P &lt; 0.05) improved right ventricular ejection fraction. PRX-08066 significantly reduced peak PA pressure at 50 and 100 mg/kg (P &lt; 0.05 and &lt; 0.01, respectively) compared with MCT control animals.

        "abstract": "The breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP, ABCG2) belongs to the superfamily of ATP binding-cassette (ABC) proteins. In addition to other physiological functions, it transports potentially cell-damaging compounds out of the cell using the energy from ATP hydrolysis. Certain tumors overexpressing BCRP were found to become resistant against various anticancer drugs. In previous work, we found that tariquidar analogues lacking the tetrahydroisoquinoline moiety selectively inhibit BCRP. In the present study, we synthesized 21 derivatives of the third-generation P-gp inhibitor HM30181, which is structurally related to tariquidar. The compounds were tested for their inhibitory activities against BCRP and screened against P-glycoprotein (P-gp, ABCB1) and multidrug resistance protein 1 (MRP1, ABCC1) to confirm the selectivity toward BCRP. The most potent compounds are selective toward BCRP and 2-fold more potent than the reference Ko143. Qualitative structure-activity relationship (SAR) analysis revealed that the presence of a methoxy group in the ortho or para position of at least one phenyl ring is beneficial for inhibitory activity. Furthermore, the cytotoxicity and multidrug resistance (MDR)-reversal ability of selected compounds were investigated. It was shown that they have a low cytotoxicity and the ability to reverse the BCRP-mediated SN-38 resistance.",

Their mechanism of action differs from that of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor antagonists, but like these drugs, renin inhibitors interrupt the negative feedback effects of angiotensin II on renin secretion. The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) has long been recognized to play a significant role in hypertension pathophysiology. Certain agents that modify the RAAS can control blood pressure and improve cardiovascular outcomes. Optimization of this compound by Novartis led to the development of aliskiren - the only direct renin inhibitor which is clinically used as an antihypertensive drug. Aliskiren is the first of a new class of antihypertensive agents. Aliskiren is a new renin inhibitor of a novel structural class that has recently been shown to be efficacious in hypertensive patients after once-daily oral dosing. In short-term studies, it was effective in lowering blood pressure either alone or in combination with valsartan and hydrochlorothiazide, and had a low incidence of serious adverse effects. It was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2007 for the use as a monotherapy or in combination with other antihypertensives. Greater reductions in blood pressure have been achieved when aliskiren was used in combination with hydrochlorothiazide or an angiotensin-receptor blocker. The most common adverse effects reported in clinical trials were headache, fatigue, dizziness, diarrhea, and nasopharyngitis. Aliskiren has not been studied in patients with moderate renal dysfunction; as an RAAS-acting drug, it should be prescribed for such patients only with caution.",

In the normal nerve, neither AChE nor serum albumin affected the cytological pattern of the nerve.

Edrophonium or propidium, other specific inhibitors of AChE, did so to a much lesser extent. Vehicle, and iso-OMPA (inhibitor of pseudocholinesterases) did not affect the cytology of the nerve. Elongation of regenerating axons was evaluated at day 3 post-crush. Native AChE applied distal to the crush reduced the elongation of regenerating axons (- 36%), while serum albumin, heated AChE and filtered AChE did not. BW284c51, edrophonium or propidium enhanced the axonal elongation (33%) when they were administered for 2 days before, but not after, the crush. Iso-OMPA or vehicle administered before or after the crush were not effective. Thus, AChE reduces elongation of regenerating axons, while inhibition of AChE enhances elongation and affects the cytology of the normal nerve as well.

In pre-clinical studies, ONT-093 could inhibit P-gp and reverse multidrug resistance at nM concentrations with no effect on paclitaxel pharmacokinetics. Phase I trials of ONT-093 in normal human volunteers showed no dose-limiting toxicities at serum concentrations associated with biologic activity achieved with doses ranging from 300 to 500 mg. METHODS: Phase I pharmacokinetic trial of ONT-093 in doses from 300 to 500 mg administered before and after intravenous paclitaxel doses of 150 to 175 mg/m(2) repeated every 21 days. All patients received paclitaxel alone on cycle 1. RESULTS: 18 patients were enrolled onto 4 dose levels. Toxicity of the combination included neutropenia, arthralgia, myalgia, and peripheral neuropathy. Four of 6 patients receiving 500 mg doses of ONT-093 and paclitaxel at 175 mg/m(2) (dose level 4) had higher-grade neutropenia with cycle 2, with 1 patient experiencing febrile neutropenia. Plasma pharmacokinetic parameters of paclitaxel were unchanged between cycle 1 and 2 for dose levels 1 to 3, but at dose level 4, 45-65% increases in paclitaxel AUC were observed in 4 of the 6 patients. Mean C(max) of ONT-093 was 9 microM (range 5-15 microM) which were 3- to 5-fold higher than in single agent studies of ONT-093. CONCLUSIONS: Doses of ONT-093 achieving serum concentrations associated with biological activity were well tolerated in combination with standard doses of paclitaxel. Toxicities of the combination in this schedule were mainly attributable to paclitaxel and dose-limiting toxicity was limited to febrile neutropenia. There was an apparent pharmacokinetic interaction between paclitaxel and ONT-093, possibly related in part to the excipient, Cremophor, present in the paclitaxel formulation.",

ANIMALS: Nine adult mixed breed dogs weighing between 18 and 27 kg. PROCEDURES: Fifty micro L of 0.25% demecarium bromide were applied to one eye of each dog every 8 h for 6 days. Blood was analyzed for AChE levels prior to commencement of eye drops, and at 45 min, 1 h 45 min, 4 h 45 min, 1 day, 3 days, and 7 days following commencement of eye drops using a 5,5'-dithiobis-(2-nitrobenzoic acid) (DTNB) reaction. RESULTS: Acetylcholinesterase levels declined over the first 24 h following commencement of demecarium administration in most dogs. This decline was highly variable and was statistically significant by 24 h. In some individuals AChE levels were suppressed to levels approaching clinical toxicity. By day 3 AChE levels had risen to levels above baseline in most dogs. CONCLUSIONS: Topical ocular application of demecarium causes transient suppression of systemic acetylcholinesterase levels in most dogs. Acetylcholinesterase levels generally do not fall to toxic levels, but may do so in certain individuals. Demecarium bromide eye drops generally do not cause AChE toxicity, but dogs receiving such therapy should be monitored for signs of AChE toxicity, and concomitant use of other AChE inhibitors should be avoided.",

In this study, approximately 140 000 small molecules were screened by in silico molecular docking. In this structure-activity relation study, the molecules with the highest predicted binding scores were identified and assayed for ACE2 enzymatic inhibitory activity and for their ability to inhibit SARS coronavirus spike protein-mediated cell fusion. This approach identified N-(2-aminoethyl)-1 aziridine-ethanamine as a novel ACE2 inhibitor that also is effective in blocking the SARS coronavirus spike protein-mediated cell fusion. Thus, the molecular docking approach resulting in the inhibitory capacity of N-(2-aminoethyl)-1 aziridine-ethanamine provides an attractive small molecule lead compound on which the development of more effective therapeutic agents could be developed to modulate hypertension and for controlling SARS infections.",

        "abstract": "Recent information suggests that free radicals are closely involved in the pathogenesis and/or progression of Parkinson's disease (PD). High-dose levodopa therapy has been suggested to increase oxidative stress, thereby accelerating the progression of PD. Based on this viewpoint, free radical scavenging, antioxidant and neuroprotective agents which may prevent the progression of PD have recently attracted considerable attention. For example, ergot derivative dopamine (DA) agonists have been reported to scavenge free radicals in vitro and show a neuroprotective effect in vivo. Non-ergot DA agonists have also recently been used in the treatment of PD despite the lack of substantial evidence for any free radical scavenging activity or antioxidant activity. The present study was conducted to assess the in vitro free radical scavenging and antioxidant activities of ropinirole, a non-ergot DA agonist, as well as its glutathione (GSH), catalase and superoxide dismutase (SOD) activating effects and neuroprotective effect in vivo. Ropinirole scavenges free radicals and suppresses lipid peroxidation in vitro, but these activities are very weak, suggesting that the antioxidant effect of ropinirole observed in vitro may be a minor component of its neuroprotective effect in vivo. Administration of ropinirole for 7 days increased GSH, catalase and SOD activities in the striatum and protected striatal dopaminergic neurons against 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) in mice. Pre-treatment with sulpiride prevented ropinirole from enhancing striatal GSH, catalase and SOD activities and abolished the protection of dopaminergic neurons against 6-OHDA. Our findings indicate that activation of GSH, catalase and SOD mediated via DA D2 receptors may be the principal mechanism of neuroprotection by ropinirole.",

The calculated IC(50 )values for inhibition of venom enzyme by malathion, carbofuran and paraquat were 2.5, 0.14, and 0.16 microM, respectively. The values for inhibition of serum butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) were 3.5, 0.09 and 0.18 microM, respectively. Analysis of kinetic data indicated that the inhibition caused by malathion, carbofuran and paraquat was mixed for venom AChE. For BChE from human serum, the inhibition caused by malathion and paraquat was mixed and for carbofuran it was uncompetitive. The present results suggest a commercial paraquat preparation (a popular herbicide) inhibits cholinesterases with similar or higher potency than classical pesticide inhibitors. Furthermore, this inhibition was observed both in human serum and snake venom, a newly studied source of AChE.",

Bis-benzimidazoles (Hoechst-33258 and -33342) were potent inhibitors of both parasite and human TOPI, but Hoechst-33342 was markedly less cytotoxic to promastigotes than to monocytes in vitro. Leishmania donovani was also considerably less sensitive than monocytes to camptothecin, both at enzyme and cellular levels. Sodium stibogluconate (SSG) was the only antimonial to inhibit TOPI, exhibiting a significant (P &lt; 0.05) 3-fold greater potency against the L. donovani enzyme but showed low cytotoxicities against intact promastigotes. The SbV meglumine antimoniate failed to inhibit TOPI and showed negligible cytotoxicities, whereas SbIII drugs were lethal to parasites and monocytes yet poor inhibitors of TOPI. Monocyte TOPII was inhibited by bis-benzimidazoles and insensitive to antimonials and camptothecin. The disparity between the high leishmanicidal activity and low anti-TOPI potency of SbIII indicates that in vivo targeting of L. donovani TOPI by the reductive pathway of antimonial activation is improbable. Nevertheless, the potent direct inhibition of TOPI by SSG and the differential interactions of camptothecin with L. donovani and human TOPI support the possibility of developing parasite-specific derivatives.",

        "abstract": "Renin is the main determinant of angiotensin (Ang) II levels. It, therefore, always appeared desirable to reduce Ang II levels by direct inhibition of renin. So far, specific renin inhibitors lacked potency and/or oral availability. We tested the new orally active nonpeptidic renin inhibitor SPP100 (Aliskiren, an octanamide with a 50% inhibitory concentration [IC50] in the low nanomolar range) in 18 healthy volunteers on a constant 100 mmol/d sodium diet using a double-blind, 3-way crossover protocol. In 3 periods of 8 days, separated by wash-outs of 6 days, each volunteer received 2 dosage levels of Aliskiren (low before high; 40 and 80 or 160 and 640 mg/d) and randomized placebo or 20 mg enalapril. Aliskiren was well tolerated. Not surprisingly, blood pressure and heart rate remained unchanged in these normotensive subjects. There was a dose-dependent decrease in plasma renin activity, Ang I, and Ang II following single doses of Aliskiren starting with 40 mg. Inhibition was still marked and significant after repeated dosing with maximal decreases in Ang II levels by 89% and 75% on Days 1 and 8, respectively, when the highest dose of Aliskiren was compared with placebo. At the same time, mean plasma active renin was increased 16- and 34-fold at the highest dose of Aliskiren. Plasma drug levels of Aliskiren were dose-dependent with maximal concentrations reached between 3 to 6 hours after administration; steady state was reached between 5 and 8 days after multiple dosing. Less than 1% of dose was excreted in the urine. Plasma and urinary aldosterone levels were decreased after doses of Aliskiren &gt; or =80 mg and after enalapril. Aliskiren at 160 and 640 mg enhanced natriuresis on Day 1 by +45% and +62%, respectively, compared with placebo (100%, ie, 87+/-11 mmol/24h) and enalapril (+54%); kaliuresis remained unchanged. In conclusion, the renin inhibitor Aliskiren dose-dependently decreases Ang II levels in humans following oral administration. The effect is long-lasting and, at a dose of 160 mg, is equivalent to that of 20 mg enalapril. Aliskiren has the potential to become the first orally active renin inhibitor that provides a true alternative to ACE-inhibitors and Ang II receptor antagonists in therapy for hypertension and other cardiovascular and renal diseases.",

        "abstract": "Thiazolidinediones are a new class of anti-diabetic agents which increase insulin sensitivity by binding to the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPAR(gamma)) and stimulating the expression of insulin-responsive genes involved in glucose and lipid metabolism. These drugs also have vasodilatory and anti-proliferative effects on vascular smooth muscle cells. However the mechanisms for these actions are not fully understood. Adenosine is a vasodilator and a substrate of equilibrative nucleoside transporters (ENT). The present study studied the effects of three thiazolidinediones, troglitazone, pioglitazone and ciglitazone, on ENT1 in the human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMCs). Although incubating HASMCs for 48h with thiazolidinediones had no effect on ENT1 mRNA and protein levels, troglitazone acutely inhibited [3H]adenosine uptake and [3H]NBMPR binding of HASMCs with IC50 values of 2.35+/-0.35 and 3.99+/-0.57microM, respectively. The effect of troglitazone on ENT1 was PPAR(gamma)-independent and kinetic studies revealed that troglitazone was a competitive inhibitor of ENT1. In contrast, pioglitazone and ciglitazone had minimal effects on [3H]adenosine uptake by HASMCs. Troglitazone differs from pioglitazone and ciglitazone in that its side-chain contains a Vitamin E moiety. The difference in structure of troglitazone did not account for its inhibitory effect on ENT1 because Vitamin E did not inhibit [3H]adenosine uptake by HASMCs. Using the nucleoside transporter deficient PK15NTD cells stably expressing ENT1 and ENT2, it was found that troglitazone inhibited ENT1 but had no effect on ENT2. From these results, it is suggested that troglitazone may enhance the vasodilatory effect of adenosine by inhibiting ENT1. Pharmacologically, troglitazone is a novel inhibitor of ENT1.",

        "abstract": "(-)-Stepholidine (SPD), an active ingredient of the Chinese herb Stephania, is the first compound found to have dual function as a dopamine receptor D1 agonist and D2 antagonist. Insights into dynamical behaviors of D1 and D2 receptors and their interaction modes with SPD are crucial in understanding the structural and functional characteristics of dopamine receptors. In this study a computational approach, integrating protein structure prediction, automated molecular docking, and molecular dynamics simulations were employed to investigate the dual action mechanism of SPD on the D1 and D2 receptors, with the eventual aim to develop new drugs for treating diseases affecting the central nervous system such as schizophrenia. The dynamics simulations revealed the surface features of the electrostatic potentials and the conformational \"open-closed\" process of the binding entrances of two dopamine receptors. Potential binding conformations of D1 and D2 receptors were obtained, and the D1-SPD and D2-SPD complexes were generated, which are in good agreement with most of experimental data. The D1-SPD structure shows that the K-167_EL-2-E-302_EL-3 (EL-2: extracellular loop 2; EL-3: extracellular loop 3) salt bridge plays an important role for both the conformational change of the extracellular domain and the binding of SPD. Based on our modeling and simulations, we proposed a mechanism of the dual action of SPD and a subsequent signal transduction model. Further mutagenesis and biophysical experiments are needed to test and improve our proposed dual action mechanism of SPD and signal transduction model.",

Inhibition of SSAO, but not monoamine oxidase, was time-dependent. Use of metabolic inhibitors, and an enzyme dilution technique, suggested that any conversion of procarbazine to an active species must be as a result of the action of SSAO itself and not of any other enzyme. The non-competitive kinetics and the time-dependence of inhibition were indicative of a suicide interaction between procarbazine and SSAO. The slow reversal of inhibition by dialysis was evidence in favour of the involvement of tight binding, rather than covalent bonding. High concentrations of benzylamine afforded the enzyme significant protection from the action of procarbazine, indicating that the interaction is at or near the active site. If the properties of procarbazine, evident in in-vitro studies, are retained in-vivo, these data suggest that procarbazine might be suitable for the examination of SSAO activities, both in-vivo and ex-vivo.",

        "abstract": "Azelaic acid, and other saturated dicarboxylic acids (C9-C12), are shown to be competitive inhibitors of tyrosinase (KI azelaic acid = 2.73 X 10(-3) M) and of membrane-associated thioredoxin reductase (KI azelaic acid = 1.25 X 10(-5) M). The monomethyl ester of azelaic acid does not inhibit thioredoxin reductase, but it does inhibit tyrosinase, although double the concentration is necessary compared with azelaic acid (KI azelaic acid monomethyl ester = 5.24 X 10(-3) M). Neither azelaic acid nor its monomethyl ester inhibit tyrosinase when catechol is used as a substrate instead of L-tyrosine. Therefore, the weak inhibitory action of azelaic acid on tyrosinase appears to be due to the competition of a single carboxylate group on this inhibitor for the alpha-carboxylate binding site of the L-tyrosine substrate on the enzyme active site. Based on the inhibitor constant on tyrosinase, at least cytotoxic levels of azelaic acid would be required for the direct inhibition of melanin biosynthesis in melanosomes if this mechanism is responsible for depigmentation in the hyperpigmentation disorders lentigo maligna and melasma. Alternatively only 10(-5) M azelaic acid is required to inhibit thioredoxin reductase. This enzyme is shown to regulate tyrosinase through a feedback mechanism involving electron transfer to intracellular thioredoxin, followed by a specific interaction between reduced thioredoxin and tyrosinase. Furthermore, the thioredoxin reductase/thioredoxin system is shown to be a principal electron donor for the ribonucleotide reductases which regulates DNA synthesis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

In order to monitor the potential development of resistance, the Neuraminidase Inhibitor Susceptibility Network was established to coordinate testing of clinical isolates collected through the World Health Organization influenza surveillance network from different regions of the world (M. Zambon and F. G. Hayden, Antivir. Res. 49:147-156, 2001). The present study establishes the baseline susceptibilities prior to and shortly after the introduction of the NA inhibitors. Over 1000 clinical influenza isolates recovered from 1996 to 1999 were tested. Susceptibilities were determined by enzyme inhibition assays with chemiluminescent or fluorescent substrates with known NA inhibitor-resistant viruses as controls. The 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC(50)s) depended upon the assay method, the drug tested, and the influenza virus subtype. By both assays, the mean zanamivir IC(50)s were 0.76, 1.82, and 2.28 nM for the subtype H1N1 (N1), H3N2 (N2), and B NAs, respectively, and the oseltamivir IC(50)s were 1.2, 0.5, and 8.8 nM for the N1, N2, and B NAs, respectively. The drug susceptibilities of known zanamivir- and oseltamivir-resistant viruses with the NA mutations E119V, R292K, H274Y, and R152K fell well outside the 95% confidence limits of the IC(50)s for all natural isolates. Sequence analysis of the NAs of viruses for which the IC(50)s were above the 95% confidence limits and several control isolates for which the IC(50)s were in the normal range revealed variations in some previously conserved residues, including D151, A203, T225, and E375 (N2 numbering).

Because the low potency and specificity of many H1 receptor antagonists have made it difficult to define the precise role of histamine as a bronchoconstrictor mediator in asthma we have used terfenadine to define the degree and selectivity of H1 blockade that can be achieved in asthmatic airways. In a double-blind study, 9 asthmatic patients received placebo or terfenadine 60, 120, and 180 mg on separate days followed 3 h later by bronchial provocation with increasing concentrations of either histamine or methacholine. Terfenadine at 60, 120, and 180 mg produced significant bronchodilation with increases in FEV1 above baseline of 9.0, 9.5, and 10%, respectively (p less than 0.05, p less than 0.01, p less than 0.01). All 3 doses of terfenadine displaced the histamine-FEV1 concentration response curves in a parallel fashion to the right in all subjects. When the degree of protection against histamine is expressed as a concentration ratio, terfenadine 60, 120, and 180 mg displaced the response curves by factors of 14.8 +/- 4.6, 22.9 +/- 6.7, and 34.3 +/- 8.4. In contrast to its effect on histamine-induced bronchoconstriction, terfenadine failed to protect the airways against the constrictor effect of inhaled methacholine. Thus, terfenadine is a much more potent and selective H1 receptor antagonist in asthmatic airways than previously available antihistamines and should provide a powerful tool to define the contribution of histamine as a bronchoconstrictor mediator in asthma.",

Androgen receptor (AR) signaling plays a key role in PC tumor growth and progression, with androgens stimulating PC proliferation and survival. Castration-resistant PC (CRPC) is characterized by increasing levels of prostate-specific antigen or radiographic progression despite androgen-deprivation therapy (ADT). In most patients, castration resistance results from aberrations in AR or the AR signaling pathway. Up to one-third of patients with localized high-risk PC will have disease progression on local therapy and develop CRPC. This review summarizes the key clinical data, including ongoing trials, for hormonal therapies in CRPC and provides an overview of the clinical development of darolutamide, a novel, nonsteroidal AR antagonist currently in phase III development for the treatment of nonmetastatic CRPC and metastatic hormone-sensitive PC. In phase I/II trials, darolutamide has demonstrated a favorable safety profile, antitumor activity, and significant decreases in prostate-specific antigen in patients with metastatic CRPC. In the phase III ARAMIS (NCT02200614; A Multinational, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Phase III Efficacy and Safety Study of Darolutamide [ODM-201] in Men With High-Risk Non-metastatic Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer) study, metastasis-free survival is being evaluated in men with nonmetastatic CRPC who will receive ADT in combination with darolutamide or placebo. The ARASENS (NCT02799602; A Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo Controlled Phase III Study of Darolutamide [ODM-201] Versus Placebo in Addition to Standard Androgen Deprivation Therapy and Docetaxel in Patients With Metastatic Hormone Sensitive Prostate Cancer) study is a placebo-controlled trial assessing whether the addition of darolutamide to ADT and docetaxel significantly prolongs overall survival in men with metastatic hormone-sensitive PC.",

        "abstract": "Many studies have demonstrated that histamine 2 receptor antagonists (H2RA) have in vitro anticholinesterase effects, but discrepancies about type and potency of this inhibitory effect exist among published results. Moreover, cholinesterase inhibition has not been shown in patients receiving H2RA. These discrepancies led us to study the in vitro antibutyryl- and in vitro antiacetylcholinesterase activities of ranitidine, cimetidine, nizatidine comparatively to pyridostigmines. Plasma cholinesterase activity (PCEA), erythrocyte cholinesterase activity (ECEA) and plasma ranitidine levels were measured in six patients before and during continuous IV infusion (150 or 200 mg/d) of ranitidine. Our in vitro results confirm the weak anticholinesterase activity of H2RA. Ranitidine is the most potent inhibitor of butyrylcholinesterase (Ki = 61 microM). Ranitidine and nizatidine are the most potent inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase (Ki' = 2.1 microM, Ki' = 5.1 microM, respectively) but one thousand times less effective than pyridostigmine (Ki = 0.003 microM). The results in patients show no statistically significant difference between PCEA and ECEA measured before and during ranitidine infusion (plasma ranitidine levels between 0.31 and 1.25 microM).",

        "abstract": "Dienogest was introduced as an oral progestin. Yet its strong oral potency on endometrial activity is not clearly explained. To circumvent this situation, steroid hormone receptor profiling using transactivation assay and endometrial activity test in rabbits were carried out with determination of plasma drug concentration. Agonistic/antagonistic activity on human progesterone receptor (PR), androgen receptor (AR), glucocorticoid receptor (GR), mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha), or estrogen receptor beta (ERbeta) were determined. Dienogest activate PR (EC50=3.4 or 10.5 nmol/l) with antagonistic activity on AR (EC50=420.6 or 775.0 nmol/l) but not agonistic nor antagonistic action on GR, MR (3000 nmol/l). Dienogest activate neither ERalpha nor ERbeta (3000 nmol/l). Progesterone activated PR with antagonistic activity on AR and on MR. Dydrogesterone showed a similar profile to progesterone. Norethisterone activated PR, AR, and ERalpha. Medroxyprogesterone acetate activated PR, AR, and GR. Danazol activated PR and AR. Collectively, dienogest has a good specificity to PR compared with the other drugs. By oral treatment, dienogest showed the strongest endometrial activity (ED50=0.0042 mg/kg) in McPhail test among other progestins (ED50 values for MPA, DYG, NES were 0.074, 1.9, &gt;0.05 mg/kg, respectively). Dienogest showed higher plasma concentrations than those of the other progestins with higher doses. The estimated plasma concentration of dienogest at ED50 (3.66 nmol/l) was close to its EC50 value to activate PR. Thus, the stronger oral activity of dienogest could be explained simply by its in vitro potency on PR and its oral pharmacokinetic profile.",

        "abstract": "We have investigated the effects of volatile anaesthetics on electron transport chain activity in the mammalian heart. Halothane, isoflurane and sevoflurane reversibly increased NADH fluorescence (autofluorescence) in intact ventricular myocytes of guinea-pig, suggesting that NADH oxidation was impaired. Using pig heart submitochondrial particles we found that the anaesthetics dose-dependently inhibited NADH oxidation in the order: halothane &gt; isoflurane = sevoflurane. Succinate oxidation was unaffected by either isoflurane or sevoflurane, indicating that these agents selectively inhibit complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase). In addition to inhibiting NADH oxidation, halothane also inhibited succinate oxidation (and succinate dehydrogenase), albeit to a lesser extent. To test the hypothesis that complex I is a target of volatile anaesthetics, we examined the effects of these agents on NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (EC 1.6.99.3) activity using the ubiquinone analogue DBQ (decylubiquinone) as substrate. Halothane, isoflurane and sevoflurane dose-dependently inhibited NADH:DBQ oxidoreductase activity. Unlike the classical inhibitor rotenone, none of the anaesthetics completely inhibited enzyme activity at high concentration, suggesting that these agents bind weakly to the 'hydrophobic inhibitory site' of complex I. In conclusion, halothane, isoflurane and sevoflurane inhibit complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) of the electron transport chain. At concentrations of approximately 2 MAC (minimal alveolar concentration), the activity of NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase was reduced by about 20 % in the presence of halothane or isoflurane, and by about 10 % in the presence of sevoflurane. These inhibitory effects are unlikely to compromise cardiac performance at usual clinical concentrations, but may contribute to the mechanism by which volatile anaesthetics induce pharmacological preconditioning.",

Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis of 125I-prothrombin activation revealed that thrombomodulin reduced the rate of prothrombin activation but did not alter the cleavage pattern. The inhibition was reversed by the inclusion of a highly specific rabbit antithrombomodulin antibody. If thrombomodulin was replaced by hirudin, the rate of thrombin generation was not decreased excluding the possibility that the inhibition by thrombomodulin was secondary to the binding of small amounts of thrombin formed early in the reaction and the prevention of feedback breakdown of prothrombin by thrombin. The inhibitory activity of thrombomodulin was overcome by increasing the concentration of Factor Xa and specific, saturable binding of thrombomodulin to Factor Xa was demonstrated. These results indicate that thrombomodulin binds to Factor Xa and thereby inhibits the activity of the prothrombinase complex.",

        "abstract": "The effects of pretreatment with selective histamine receptor antagonists on changes in sympathoadrenal activity and haemodynamics, induced by 60-min immobilization stress, were studied in conscious rats. Using adrenomedullary microdialysis, it was shown that ranitidine (5 mg/kg, i.v.), a histamine H2 receptor antagonist, selectively suppressed stress-stimulated noradrenaline secretion without affecting adrenaline response, whereas triprolidine (10 mg/kg, i.v.), a histamine H1 receptor antagonist, had little effect on stress-induced secretion of both catecholamines. Neither triprolidine nor ranitidine changed the pressor response to 60-min stress. The stress-induced increase in heart rate was not altered by triprolidine, whereas ranitidine reduced it after 30 min of stress. To test whether the anti-secretory effect of ranitidine could be of peripheral origin, in a separate experimental series, a local catecholamine secretion was stimulated by histamine (0.5 mM) perfused through the adrenomedullary dialysis probe. It appeared that triprolidine, but not ranitidine, reduced this effect of histamine. Thus, the present results suggest that during stress, the activity of the central histaminergic system, via histamine H2-receptors, may selectively modulate noradrenaline secretion by the adrenal gland.",

        "abstract": "Azelaic acid has been shown to inhibit thioredoxin reductase (TR) at the surface of guinea pig and human skin, on cultures of human keratinocytes, melanocytes, melanoma cells, murine melanoma cells (Cloudman S91), and on purified enzymes from Escherichia coli, rat liver, and human melanoma. Human melanoma cells are more resistant to inhibition by azelaic acid than murine melanoma or human melanocytes. Kinetic studies with pure TRs indicate that azelaic acid is a reversible competitive inhibitor. Fluorescence spectroscopy has been used to show that azelaic acid does not interfere with electron transfer from NADPH to FAD on TR. However, azelaic acid does inhibit electron transfer from the dithiolate active site of this enzyme. Inhibition by azelaic acid is pH-dependent, requiring the dissociation of both carboxylate groups, and also the dissociation of the active site dithiol groups. Binding studies with [14C]azelaic acid at different pHs, indicate that inhibition is first due to the formation of a thioester on the active thiolate groups followed by transacylation of a basic amino acid residue in the active site. A comparative study of TR inhibition by C6, C9, C10 and C12 saturated dicarboxylic acids was also determined on guinea pig skin in vivo. These homologous dicarboxylic acids gave greater inhibition with increasing size (i.e. mol wt.).",

CaMPDE exists as tissue-specific isozymes, and initially these isozymes were designated according to their respective subunit molecular mass. A variety of pharmacological agents have been used to inhibit CaMPDE, and this inhibition occurs mostly via Ca2+-dependent association with the proteins. We have examined the effect of dihydropyridine Ca2+-channel blockers felodipine and nicardipine on CaMPDE. The results suggest that the 63-kDa (PDE 1B1) and 60-kDa (PDE 1A2) CaMPDE isozymes are inhibited by felodipine and nicardipine by partial competitive inhibition and that these two Ca2+ antagonists appear to counteract each other. This study further demonstrates the existence of a specific site, distinct from the active site on CaMPDE, that exhibits high-affinity binding of these drugs. Felodipine and nicardipine have similar affinities for 60-kDa CaMPDE isozymes but bring about different levels of enzyme inhibition, suggesting the possibility of designing specific drugs that can protect the enzyme from inhibition by dihydropyridine Ca2+-channel blockers.",

        "abstract": "Ziprasidone (CP-88,059) is a combined 5-HT (serotonin) and dopamine receptor antagonist which exhibits potent effects in preclinical assays predictive of antipsychotic activity. Whereas the compound is a dopamine antagonist in vitro and in vivo, its most potent action is antagonism of 5-HT2A receptors, where its affinity is an order of magnitude greater than that observed for dopamine D2 sites. Laboratory and clinical findings have led to a hypothesis that antagonism of 5-HT2A receptors in the brain limits the undesirable motor side effects associated with dopamine receptor blockade and improves efficacy against the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Ziprasidone possesses an in vitro 5-HT2A/dopamine D2 receptor affinity ratio higher than any clinically available antipsychotic agent. In vivo, ziprasidone antagonizes 5-HT2A receptor-induced head twitch with 6-fold higher potency than for blockade of d-amphetamine-induced hyperactivity, a measure of central dopamine D2 receptor antagonism. Ziprasidone also has high affinity for the 5-HT1A, 5-HT1D and 5-HT2C receptor subtypes, which may further enhance its therapeutic potential. The prediction of antipsychotic efficacy without severe motor side effects is supported by the relatively weak potency of ziprasidone to produce catalepsy in animals, contrasted with its potent antagonism of conditioned avoidance responding and dopamine agonist-induced locomotor activation and stereotypy. The compound is well tolerated in animals at doses producing effective dopamine antagonism in the brain. Ziprasidone should be a valuable addition to the treatment of psychotic disorders.",

        "abstract": "Trypanothione reductase is a key enzyme in the trypanothione-based redox metabolism of pathogenic trypanosomes. Because this system is absent in humans, being replaced with glutathione and glutathione reductase, it offers a target for selective inhibition. The rational design of potent inhibitors requires accurate structures of enzyme-inhibitor complexes, but this is lacking for trypanothione reductase. We therefore used quinacrine mustard, an alkylating derivative of the competitive inhibitor quinacrine, to probe the active site of this dimeric flavoprotein. Quinacrine mustard irreversibly inactivates Trypanosoma cruzi trypanothione reductase, but not human glutathione reductase, in a time-dependent manner with a stoichiometry of two inhibitors bound per monomer. The rate of inactivation is dependent upon the oxidation state of trypanothione reductase, with the NADPH-reduced form being inactivated significantly faster than the oxidized form. Inactivation is slowed by clomipramine and a melarsen oxide-trypanothione adduct (both are competitive inhibitors) but accelerated by quinacrine. The structure of the trypanothione reductase-quinacrine mustard adduct was determined to 2.7 A, revealing two molecules of inhibitor bound in the trypanothione-binding site. The acridine moieties interact with each other through pi-stacking effects, and one acridine interacts in a similar fashion with a tryptophan residue. These interactions provide a molecular explanation for the differing effects of clomipramine and quinacrine on inactivation by quinacrine mustard. Synergism with quinacrine occurs as a result of these planar acridines being able to stack together in the active site cleft, thereby gaining an increased number of binding interactions, whereas antagonism occurs with nonplanar molecules, such as clomipramine, where stacking is not possible.",

        "title": "Clinical pharmacology, therapeutic use and potential of COMT inhibitors in Parkinson's disease.",
        "abstract": "When peripheral decarboxylation is blocked by carbidopa or benserazide, the main metabolic pathway of levodopa is O-methylation by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT). Entacapone and tolcapone are new potent, selective and reversible nitrocatechol-type COMT inhibitors. Animal studies have demonstrated that entacapone mainly has a peripheral effect whereas tolcapone also inhibits O-methylation in the brain. In human volunteers, both entacapone and tolcapone dose-dependently inhibit the COMT activity in erythrocytes, improve the bioavailability and decrease the elimination of levodopa, and inhibit the formation of 3-O-methyldopa (3-OMD). Entacapone is administered with every scheduled dose of levodopa whereas tolcapone is administered 3 times daily. The different administration regimens for these agents are based on their different pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles. Both entacapone and tolcapone enhance and extend the therapeutic effect of levodopa in patients with advanced and fluctuating Parkinson's disease. They prolong the duration of levodopa effect. Clinical studies show that they increase the daily ON time by an average 1 to 3 hours, improve the activities of daily living and allow daily levodopa dosage to be decreased. Correspondingly, they significantly reduce the daily OFF time. No comparative studies between entacapone and tolcapone have been performed. Tolcapone also appears to have a beneficial effect in patients with nonfluctuating Parkinson's disease. The main adverse effects of the COMT inhibitors are related to their dopaminergic and gastrointestinal effects. Enhancement of dopaminergic activity may cause an initial worsening of levodopa-induced adverse effects, such as dyskinesia, nausea, vomiting, orthostatic hypotension, sleep disorders and hallucinations. Levodopa dose adjustment is recommended to avoid these events. Tolcapone is associated with diarrhoea in about 16 to 18% of patients and entacapone in less than 10% of patients. Diarrhoea has led to discontinuation in 5 to 6% of patients treated with tolcapone and in 2.5% of those treated with entacapone. Urine discoloration to dark yellow or orange is related to the colour of COMT inhibitors and their metabolites. Elevated liver transaminase levels are reported in 1 to 3% of patients treated with tolcapone but very rarely, if at all, in patients treated with entacapone. The descriptions of acute, fatal fulminant hepatitis and potentially fatal neurological reactions, such as neuroleptic malignant syndrome and rhabdomyolysis, in association with tolcapone led to the suspension of its marketing authorisation in the European Community and Canada. In many other countries, the use of tolcapone is restricted to patients who are not responding satisfactorily to other therapies. Regular monitoring of liver enzymes is required if tolcapone is used. No such adverse reactions have so far been described for entacapone and no laboratory monitoring has been proposed. COMT inhibitors added to levodopa therapy are beneficial, particularly in patients with fluctuating disease. They may be combined with other antiparkinsonian drugs, such as dopamine agonists, selegiline and anticholinergics without adverse interactions. They provide a new treatment possibility in patients with Parkinson's disease who have problems with their present levodopa therapy.",

We use a close celecoxib analog deficient in COX-2-inhibitory activity, DMC (4-[5-(2,5-dimethylphenyl)-3(trifluoromethyl)-1H-pyrazol-1-yl]benzene-sulfonamide), to examine the premise that Akt signaling represents a major non-COX-2 target. Celecoxib and DMC block Akt activation in PC-3 cells through the inhibition of phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK-1) with IC(50) of 48 and 38 micro M, respectively. The consequent effect on Akt activation is more pronounced (IC(50) values of 28 and 20 micro M, respectively), which might be attributed to the concomitant dephosphorylation by protein phosphatase 2A. In serum-supplemented medium, celecoxib and DMC cause G(1) arrest, and at higher concentrations, they induce apoptosis with relative potency comparable with that in blocking Akt activation. Moreover, the effect of daily oral celecoxib and DMC at 100 and 200 mg/kg on established PC-3 xenograft tumors is assessed. Celecoxib at both doses and DMC at 100 mg/kg had marginal impacts. However, a correlation exists between the in vitro potency of DMC and its ability at 200 mg/kg to inhibit xenograft tumor growth through the inhibition of Akt activation. Analysis of the tumor samples indicates that a differential reduction in the phospho-Akt/Akt ratio was noted in celecoxib- and DMC-treated groups vis-a-vis the control group. Together, these data underscore the role of 3-phosphoinositide-dependent protein kinase-1/Akt signaling in celecoxib-mediated in vitro antiproliferative effects in prostate cancer cells.",

        "abstract": "Azelastine has previously been demonstrated to inhibit histamine release, to antagonize histamine-mediated responses, and to be a bronchodilator. To determine the mechanism by which azelastine has antihistaminic and bronchodilatory actions, we studied its interaction with relevant human lung receptors. We performed competitive radioligand binding assays and determined the affinity of azelastine for [3H]pyrilamine (histamine H1), [125I]pindolol (beta), and [3H]quinuclidinyl benzilate (muscarinic) binding sites. Azelastine had a relatively high affinity for histamine H1 receptors with IC50 values consistently as low or lower than values measured for other antihistamines. In contrast, azelastine had a very low affinity for both beta-receptors and muscarinic receptors with IC50 values greater than 2 logs greater than those determined for beta-agonists and muscarinic antagonists, respectively. Thus, bronchodilatory activity of azelastine does not appear to result from either beta-agonist or muscarinic-antagonist properties. Azelastine does, however, have the ability to inhibit the release of histamine and to bind to histamine H1 receptors, thereby effectively antagonizing histamine H1 receptor-mediated responses in the lung. These characteristics make azelastine a potentially very useful drug to treat allergic responses in the respiratory tract.",

        "abstract": "Variations in diuretic-mediated inhibition of carbonic anhydrase-dependent chloride transport in platelets and vascular smooth muscle could account for the contrasting efficacy of the thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics in reducing cardiovascular morbidity in patients with hypertension. We assessed platelet carbonic anhydrase activity and catecholamine-induced platelet aggregation in the presence of a thiazide and a \"thiazide-like\" inhibitor of the sodium-chloride cotransporter. Individual variation in platelet carbonic anhydrase activity correlated with contrasting sensitivity to epinephrine-mediated platelet aggregation. Both chlorthalidone, which potently inhibits platelet carbonic anhydrase, and bendroflumethiazide, which has much less effect on this enzyme, increased the amount of epinephrine needed to induce platelet aggregation when compared with the absence of a diuretic. However, chlorthalidone was significantly more effective than bendroflumethiazide in reducing epinephrine-mediated platelet aggregation. Chlorthalidone also induced marked changes in the number of gene transcripts for two proteins that mediate angiogenesis and vascular permeability, vascular endothelial growth factor C and transforming growth factor-beta3; chlorthalidone and bendroflumethiazide had contrasting effects on the expression of vascular endothelial growth factor C. Chlorthalidone and bendroflumethiazide reduced vascular permeability to albumin, but only chlorthalidone increased angiogenesis. Thiazides and thiazide-like diuretics can comparably reduce blood pressure, but the drugs in this class are not all alike. It can be suggested from our findings that thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics vary in their pleiotropic effects on platelets and in the vasculature, and these differences could explain the contrasting ability of these drugs to reduce cardiovascular morbidity despite comparable reduction in blood pressure.",

        "abstract": "Kinetic parameters of the effect of tacrine as a cholinesterase inhibitor have been studied in two different sources: snake venom (Bungarus sindanus) acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and human serum butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). Tacrine inhibited both venom acetylcholinesterase (AChE) as well as human serum butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) in a concentration-dependent manner. Kinetic studies indicated that the nature of inhibition was mixed for both enzymes, i.e. Km values increase and Vmax decrease with the increase of the tacrine concentration. The calculated IC50 for snake venom and for human serum were 31 and 25.6 nM, respectively. Ki was observed to be 13 nM for venom acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and 12 nM for serum butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). KI (constant of AChE-ASCh-tacrine complex into AChE-ASCh complex and tacrine) was estimated to be 20 nM for venom and 10 nM for serum butyrylcholinesterase (BChE), while the gammaKm (dissociation constant of AChE-ASCh-tacrine complex into AChE-tacrine complex and ASCh) were 0.086 and 0.147 mM for snake venom AChE and serum BChE, respectively. The present results suggest that this therapeutic agent used for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease can also be considered an inhibitor of snake venom and human serum butyrylcholinesterase. Values of Ki and KI show that tacrine had more affinity with these enzymes as compared with other cholinesterases from the literature.",

        "abstract": "Epinastine is an antihistamine drug with binding affinities at 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptors. The current study was performed to investigate whether epinastine could modulate the cholinergic contraction in guinea pig and human airways in vitro. Isolated guinea pig and human airway preparations were suspended in organ baths containing modified Krebs-Henseleit solution. Electrical field stimulation was applied to elicit cholinergic contractions. Epinastine produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of the cholinergic contraction in guinea pig airways and pretreatment with methysergide (5-HT1/2/7 antagonist) significantly attenuated these inhibitory effects of epinastine. Pretreatment with tropisetron (5-HT3/4 antagonist), ketanserin (5-HT2 antagonist), SDZ216-525 (5-HT1A antagonist) or phentolamine (alpha-adrenergic antagonist) had no effect. Epinastine did not displace the concentration-response curve to acetylcholine. These results suggest that epinastine inhibits the cholinergic contraction in guinea pig airways through stimulation of prejunctional 5-hydroxytryptamine receptors, located to postganglionic cholinergic nerves. Inhibitory effects of epinastine on the cholinergic contraction in human airways in vitro were also demonstrated, which suggests that a similar mechanism might be present in human airways. The pharmacological profile of epinastine, which shows binding affinity at the 5-hydroxytryptamine7 receptor but not at the 5-hydroxytryptamine1 receptor subtypes corroborates the hypothesis that the inhibitory prejunctional 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor on cholinergic nerves is of the 5-hydroxytryptamine7 subtype.",

        "abstract": "First generation thrombolytics (streptokinase and urokinase) had no fibrin binding capabilities and caused systemic plasminogen activation with concomitant destruction of haemostatic proteins. A primary driving force behind the development of the second generation plasminogen activator tissue plasminogen activator (tPA or alteplase) was its ability to bind to fibrin and target thrombolysis. Although in vitro assays highlighted advantages of fibrin binding, clinical trials were disappointing, showing only small benefits in mortality with tPA versus streptokinase, but also with some increase in haemorrhagic stroke. Third generation thrombolytic agents (reteplase, tenecteplase and pamiteplase) are variants of tPA engineered to have improved structure/function, such as longer half life and resistance to inhibitors. However, clear therapeutic advantages of third generation thrombolytics in clinical trials have also been difficult to demonstrate. Although fibrin binding is critical in regulating the activity of tPA, it is not clear how important it is for thrombolytic treatment. Advances are needed in our understanding of the relationship between structure/binding and activity of PAs in vivo under normal conditions and when administered in pharmacological doses. Clearly the impact of fibrin structure and the other components in fibrin clots must also be considered. Ultimately these studies may lead to better engineered therapeutics or optimised mixtures of molecules. With a more detailed understanding of the regulation of plasminogen activation and fibrinolysis it might be possible to tailor thrombolytic therapy to different situations such as myocardial or cerebrovascular treatment or to the patient's age and sex and other characteristics.",

        "abstract": "Dopamine D2 receptors are known to regulate the release of catecholamines from neurons in the central and peripheral nervous systems. In the present study we have evaluated the effects of dopamine D2 agonists and antagonists on the release of endogenous norepinephrine and epinephrine stimulated by 50 microM nicotine in isolated bovine chromaffin cells in order to investigate whether isolated bovine chromaffin cells may contain functional dopamine D2 receptors. Dopamine (10(-4) and 10(-6) M), quinpirole (10(-5) M) and 2-amino-5,6-dihydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene hydrobromide (10(-5) M) had no effect on the nicotine-stimulated release of norepinephrine or epinephrine from the bovine chromaffin cells. Pergolide (10(-6) M) and apomorphine (10(-4) M) produced a significant inhibition of nicotine-stimulated release of both norepinephrine and epinephrine from the chromaffin cells. The inhibitory effect of the selective dopamine D2 agonist pergolide on catecholamine release from the chromaffin cells was not reversed by 10(-6) M concentrations of the selective dopamine D2 receptor antagonists haloperidol, domperidone, metaclopramide, fluphenazine, flupentixol, (+)- or (-)-sulpiride, the dopamine D1 receptor antagonist SCH 23390 (10(-7) M) or the alpha receptor antagonist phentolamine (10(-6) M). These data suggest that the inhibition of nicotine-stimulated release of catecholamines from the bovine chromaffin cells is not a receptor-mediated effect. Further studies showed that the inhibitory effect of pergolide on catecholamine release in the bovine chromaffin cells was correlated with an inhibition of nicotine-stimulated 45Ca++ uptake and 22Na+ uptake into these cells. It is concluded that functional dopamine D2 receptors of the classical type do not exist on isolated bovine chromaffin cells.",

        "title": "Rivastigmine, a brain-region selective acetylcholinesterase inhibitor for treating Alzheimer's disease: review and current status.",
        "abstract": "Alzheimer's disease is, in part, characterised by the loss of neurones in the basal forebrain cholinergic cells that project to the cerebral cortex and hippocampus. These impairments have correlated with the memory loss noted in dementia of the Alzheimer's type. This 'cholinergic hypothesis' has led to the rational design of drugs to enhance or stimulate acetylcholine-mediated neurotransmission. Early acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, such as tacrine and physostigmine, are poorly tolerated and have a short duration of action. Rivastigmine is a centrally-selective acetylcholinesterase inhibitor with a relatively long duration of action and is a 'pseudo-irreversible' cholinesterase inhibitor due to slow dissociation of a carbamoyl derivative from the esteratic site of acetylcholinesterase. Preclinical studies confirmed the central selectivity of the drug and its distribution into the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Early studies demonstrated that rivastigmine improved cognition and was relatively well-tolerated at moderate doses. Clinical investigations of rivastigmine administered at doses of 6 - 12 mg/day significantly improved cognition, as measured by the ADAS-Cog score, and activities of daily living, as measured by the Progressive Deterioration Scale. Significant global improvements were also noted as measured by the Clinician's Interview Based Impression of Change that required the use of caregiver information. The most frequent adverse effects noted in clinical trials were consistent with peripheral cholinergic stimulation and included nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, dizziness and diarrhoea. These effects were dose-related and minimised by slow dose-escalation upon initiation of therapy. Rivastigmine undergoes minimal metabolism by the cytochrome P450 system. As a result, it has few drug interactions. The drug is currently marketed widely in over 60 countries worldwide. In the United States, the drug received 'approvable' status subsequent to the NDA filing, and should be available later this year.",

        "abstract": "Chronic idiopathic urticaria (CIU) is a disabling affliction that considerably limits patients' daily activities and interferes with sleep. Clinical studies have shown that histamine H1-receptor antagonists (antihistamines) are highly effective for inhibiting the hives/wheals and pruritus associated with CIU, as well as improving patients' quality of life. Desloratadine is a rapid-acting, once-daily, nonsedating selective H1-receptor antagonist/inverse receptor agonist with proven clinical efficacy in patients with CIU. It has 10-20 times the in vivo H1 receptor-binding affinity of loratadine, its parent compound, and 52-194 times the H1 receptor-binding affinity of cetirizine, ebastine, loratadine, and fexofenadine. Desloratadine displays linear pharmacokinetics after oral administration. Age and sex have no apparent effect on the drug's metabolism and elimination, and food does not affect its bioavailability or absorption. Desloratadine also exerts anti-inflammatory effects via mechanisms that are independent of H1-receptor antagonism. Results from randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies of 6 weeks' duration in adults and adolescents with moderate-to-severe CIU indicate that desloratadine significantly minimizes the severity of pruritus, reduces the number and size of hives, and improves disease-impaired sleep and daily activities. Improvements were noted after a single dose of desloratadine and were maintained over 6 weeks of treatment. Desloratadine was safe and well tolerated in clinical trials of patients with CIU. The adverse effect profile of desloratadine in adults, as well as in children aged from 6 months to 11 years, is comparable to that of placebo. Evaluations of cognitive and psychomotor performance in adults indicate no impairment of function with dosages of desloratadine 5 mg/day. In conclusion, desloratadine is an important therapeutic option for prompt and enduring symptom relief in patients with moderate-to-severe CIU. In addition to efficacy and safety, desloratadine affords a convenient administration regimen, rapid onset of action, and an absence of drug-drug or drug-food interactions. Other important prescribing considerations are that, unlike all first-generation and some second-generation antihistamines, desloratadine is nonsedating at its clinically approved dosage and does not impair psychomotor function.",

        "abstract": "Progressive cardiac remodeling is characterized by subsequent chamber hypertrophy, enlargement, and pump dysfunction. It is also associated with increased cardiac fibrosis and matrix turnover. Interestingly, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) alpha activators reduce cardiac hypertrophy, inflammation, and fibrosis. Little is known about the role of fenofibrates in mediating PPARalpha-independent effects in response to chronic pressure overload (PO). Wild-type and PPARalpha-deficient mice were subjected to chronic PO caused by ascending aortic constriction to test the role of fenofibrates in chronic, progressive cardiac remodeling by a PPARalpha-independent mechanism. Mice were randomized to regular chow or chow-containing fenofibrate (100 mg/kg of body weight per day) for 1 week before and 8 weeks after ascending aortic constriction. In the presence of PPARalpha, wild-type chronic PO mice, treated with fenofibrate, had improved cardiac remodeling. However, PO PPARalpha-deficient mice treated with fenofibrate had increased mortality, significantly adverse left ventricular end diastolic (3.4+/-0.1 versus 4.2+/-0.1 mm) and end systolic (1.5+/-0.2 versus 2.5+/-0.2 mm) dimensions, and fractional shortening (57+/-3% versus 40+/-3%). Fenofibrate also increased myocardial hypertrophy, cardiac fibrosis, and the ratio of matrix metalloproteinase-2/tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-2 in PO PPARalpha-deficient mice. Fenofibrate inhibited matrix metalloproteinase activity in vitro and aldosterone-induced increases in extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation. Thus, fenofibrate improved cardiac remodeling in chronic PO mice. However, in PPARalpha-deficient mice, this chronic PO was exacerbated and associated with increased myocardial fibrosis and altered matrix remodeling. In the absence of PPARalpha, fenofibrates exerts deleterious, pleiotropic myocardial actions. This is an important observation, because PPARalpha agonists are considered possible inhibitory regulators of cardiac remodeling in the remodeled heart.",

        "abstract": "L-mimosine is a naturally occurring plant amino acid and iron chelator that arrests the cell cycle in the late G(1) phase, although its mechanism of action is not known. Some studies indicate that mimosine prevents the initiation of DNA replication, whereas other studies indicate that mimosine disrupts elongation of the replication fork by impairing deoxyribonucleotide synthesis by inhibiting the activity of the iron-dependent enzyme ribonucleotide reductase and the transcription of the cytoplasmic serine hydroxymethyltransferase gene (SHMT1). In this study, the mechanism for mimosine-induced inhibition of SHMT1 transcription was elucidated. A mimosine-responsive transcriptional element was localized within the first 50 base pairs of the human SHMT1 promoter by deletion analyses and gel mobility shift assays. The 50-base-pair sequence contains a consensus zinc-sensing metal regulatory element (MRE) at position -44 to -38, and mutation of the MRE attenuated mimosine-induced transcription repression. Mimosine treatment eliminated MRE- and Sp1-binding activity in nuclear extracts from MCF-7 cells but not in nuclear extracts from a mimosine-resistant cell line, MCF-7/2a. MCF-7 cells cultured in zinc-depleted medium for more than 16 days were viable and lacked cytoplasmic serine hydroxymethyltransferase protein, confirming that mimosine inhibits SHMT1 transcription by chelating zinc. The disruption of DNA-protein interactions by zinc chelation provides a general mechanism for the inhibitory effects of mimosine on nuclear processes, including replication and transcription. Furthermore, this study establishes that SHMT1 is a zinc-inducible gene, which provides the first mechanism for the regulation of folate-mediated one-carbon metabolism by zinc.",

        "abstract": "The bisdioxopiperazines, including dexrazoxane (ICRF-187), are catalytic or noncleavable complex-forming inhibitors of DNA topoisomerase II that do not produce DNA strand breaks. In this study we show that dexrazoxane inhibits the division of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells resulting in marked increases in cell size (up to 80 microm in diameter), volume (up to 150-fold greater), and ploidy (as high as 32N). This last result indicates that the dexrazoxane-induced DNA reduplication was restricted to once per cell cycle. Kinetic analysis of the flow cytometry data indicated that the conversion between successively higher ploidy levels was progressively slowed at longer times of exposure to dexrazoxane. Both the protein and DNA content of dexrazoxane-treated CHO cells increased linearly over time in the same proportion. Light and electron microscopic studies of dexrazoxane-treated cells showed ring-like multilobulated nuclei. Immunohistochemical staining of dexrazoxane-treated cells showed that F-actin and acetylated alpha-tubulin were present in large, highly organized networks. Immunohistochemical staining of the dexrazoxane-treated CHO cells also showed that the topoisomerase II alpha colocalized with the DNA of the multilobulated nuclei. Staining of gamma-tubulin revealed that the dexrazoxane-treated cells contained multiple centrosomes, indicating that dexrazoxane prevents cytokinesis but not centrosome reduplication. It is concluded that dexrazoxane inhibits CHO cytokinesis in cells by virtue of its ability to inhibit topoisomerase II.",

In this study, stable cell lines expressing the ferret dopamine D2-long (D2L) and D4 receptors were used to characterize known dopamine agonists via radioligand binding and calcium ion flux assays, while emetic activity of these dopamine receptor agonists was determined in male ferrets. Latencies to first emetic event, average number of emetic episodes, and stereotypical behaviors which may be indicative of nausea were also determined. Agonists at dopamine D1-like and D4 receptors had no emetic effect in ferrets. Conversely, stimulation of dopamine D2 and/or D3 receptors resulted in a robust emetic response characterized by a relatively short latency (&lt;15 min) and multiple emetic events. Competitive antagonists of dopamine D2-like receptors (domperidone, haloperidol) dose-dependently blocked the emetic response to PNU95666E, a dopamine D2 receptor selective agonist. Thus, dopamine D2 and/or D3 receptor agonists elicit emesis, while dopamine D1/D5 or D4 receptor-selective agonists are devoid of emetic properties.",

        "abstract": "One of the fundamental principles of pharmacology is that most drugs have side effects. Although considerable attention is paid to detrimental side effects, drugs can also have beneficial side effects. Given the time and expense of drug development, it would be particularly exciting if a systematic method could be applied to reveal all of the activities, including the unappreciated actions, of a potential drug. The present study takes the first step along this path. An activity-based proteomics strategy was used to simultaneously identify targets and screen for their inhibitors in prostate cancer. Orlistat, a Food and Drug Administration-approved drug used for treating obesity, was included in this screen. Surprisingly, we find a new molecular target and a potential new application for Orlistat. Orlistat is a novel inhibitor of the thioesterase domain of fatty acid synthase, an enzyme strongly linked to tumor progression. By virtue of its ability to inhibit fatty acid synthase, Orlistat halts tumor cell proliferation, induces tumor cell apoptosis, and inhibits the growth of PC-3 tumors in nude mice.",

        "abstract": "Dexrazoxane (ICRF-187), which is clinically used to reduce doxorubicin-induced cardiotoxicity, has cell growth inhibitory properties through its ability to inhibit the catalytic activity of DNA topoisomerase II. A study was undertaken to investigate whether preincubating Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO) with dexrazoxane prior to camptothecin treatment resulted in potentiation. Camptothecin is a DNA topoisomerase I poison. It was found that pretreating CHO cells with concentrations of dexrazoxane sufficient to strongly inhibit topoisomerase II for periods from 18 to 96 h resulted in significant antagonism of camptothecin-mediated growth inhibition. Lower concentrations that were sufficient to cause partial inhibition of topoisomerase II and partial dexrazoxane-mediated cell growth inhibition had little effect on camptothecin-mediated growth inhibition. Neither topoisomerase I protein levels nor camptothecin-induced topoisomerase I-DNA covalent complexes were affected by dexrazoxane concentrations that were sufficient to cause antagonism of camptothecin-induced growth inhibition. However, under these experimental conditions, dexrazoxane caused a decrease in DNA synthesis. Therefore, results presented here confirm the importance of the DNA synthesis-dependent replication fork interaction with topoisomerase I-DNA covalent complexes for the expression of camptothecin activity. It is concluded that dexrazoxane and camptothecin analogs should be used with caution in combination chemotherapy.",

        "abstract": "A family of five subtypes of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChR) has been identified based on their molecular structures and second signal transduction pathways. In the present study, we examined the antagonist binding profiles of 9 muscarinic antagonists (atropine, 4-DAMP, pirenzepine, oxybutynin, tiquizium, timepidium, propiverine, darifenacin and zamifenacin) for human muscarinic acetylcholine receptor subtypes (m1, m2, m3, m4 and m5) produced by using a baculovirus infection system in Sf9 insect cells, and rat tissue membrane preparations (heart and submandibular gland). In a scopolamine methyl chloride [N-methyl-3H]- ([3H]NMS) binding assay, pirenzepine and timepidium displayed the highest affinities for the m1 and m2 subtypes, respectively, and both zamifenacin and darifenacin had the highest affinities for the m3 subtype, although the selectivities among the five subtypes were less than 10-fold. Propiverine showed a slightly higher affinity for the m5 subtype, whereas none of the drugs used in this study was uniquely selective for the m4 subtype. The binding affinities of muscarinic antagonists for rat heart and submandibular gland strong correlated with those for human cloned m2 and m3 subtypes, respectively. These data suggest that [3H]NMS binding studies using rat heart and submandibular gland might be useful methods which predict the affinities of test drugs for human muscarinic M2 and M3 receptor subtypes.",

The neuropathology of PD dementia (PDD) is likely multifactorial and affects several neuronal populations. There is evidence that PDD is associated with a cholinergic deficit, supporting the therapeutic role of cholinesterase inhibitors, which are already first-line agents in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. Open-label and small controlled studies suggested a clinical efficacy of cholinesterase inhibitors in PDD. One large randomized placebo-controlled trial of 541 patients demonstrated that oral rivastigmine improved cognition, attention and executive functions, activities of daily living and behavioral symptoms after 6 months of treatment. Rivastigmine is a dual cholinesterase inhibitor, being effective on both acetylcholinesterase and butyrylcholinesterase. This paper reviews the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of rivastigmine (oral and transdermal administration). It also reviews evidence on clinical efficacy, safety and tolerability of the oral administration in PDD patients at doses of 3-12 mg/day.",

        "title": "Penicillin-binding proteins and role of amdinocillin in causing bacterial cell death.",
        "abstract": "The activity of penicillins against bacteria is in large part related to binding to specific receptor proteins involved in cell wall biosynthesis. These proteins have been designated penicillin-binding proteins. They can be separated into distinct entities through the use of acrylamide gel electrophoresis and binding of radioactive 14C-labeled penicillin G. Six major proteins have been defined in the Enterobacteriaceae, penicillin-binding proteins 1 to 6. Selection of mutants has shown that there are three essential proteins: penicillin-binding protein 1, which is divided into penicillin-binding protein 1Bs, a peptidoglycan transpeptidase, and penicillin-binding protein 1A, which acts as a replacement for penicillin-binding protein 1Bs. Penicillin-binding protein 2 is a murein-elongation initiating enzyme and penicillin-binding protein 3 is a septal murein-synthesizing enzyme. Penicillin-binding proteins 4, 5, and 6 are not essential for bacterial survival. Binding of penicillins to penicillin-binding protein 1Bs produces lysis, binding to penicillin-binding protein 2 produces round cells, and binding to penicillin-binding protein 3 produces long filaments. Amdinocillin is a beta-amidino penicillanic acid derivative that binds specifically to penicillin-binding protein 2. The compound is more beta-lactamase stable than ampicillin and has no major delay in entry into the periplasmic space as do some penicillins. Amdinocillin inhibits most of the Enterobacteriaceae, with the exception of some indole-positive Proteus species, but it does not inhibit gram-positive cocci or Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Amdinocillin produces spherical bacterial cells that eventually lyse. Its activity in vitro is markedly affected by ionic content of media. This agent acts synergistically with many penicillins, such as ampicillin, carbenicillin, and the like, and with cephalosporins, cefazolin, cefamandole, or cefoxitin to inhibit gram-negative bacilli, probably on the basis of binding to different proteins needed for the production of the peptidoglycan of the bacterial cell wall. Amdinocillin possesses a number of the essentials for effective antimicrobial activity and, by virtue of its enhancement of the activity of other beta-lactams, may prove to be a useful agent in the chemotherapy of certain infections.",

        "abstract": "The statins are powerful inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methyl glutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase), the key enzyme in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, and are among the most widely prescribed drugs in the world. Despite their clinical importance, little is known about the binding thermodynamics of statins to HMG-CoA reductase. In this paper, we report the results of inhibition kinetics and microcalorimetric analysis of a representative type I statin (pravastatin) and four type II statins (fluvastatin, cerivastatin, atorvastatin, and rosuvastatin). Inhibition constants (K(i)) range from 2 to 250 nM for the different statins. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) experiments yield binding enthalpies (DeltaH(binding)) ranging between zero and -9.3 kcal/mol at 25 degrees C. There is a clear correlation between binding affinity and binding enthalpy: the most powerful statins bind with the strongest enthalpies. The proportion by which the binding enthalpy contributes to the binding affinity is not the same for all statins, indicating that the balance among hydrogen bonding, van der Waals, and hydrophobic interactions is not the same for all of them. At 25 degrees C, the dominant contribution to the binding affinity of fluvastatin, pravastatin, cerivastatin, and atorvastatin is the entropy change. Only for rosuvastatin does the enthalpy change contribute more than 50% of the total binding energy (76%). Since the enthalpic and entropic contributions to binding originate from different types of interactions, the thermodynamic dissection presented here provides a way to identify interactions that are critical for affinity and specificity.",

        "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Previous work demonstrated that both the opioid antagonist (-)-naloxone and the non-opioid (+)-naloxone inhibit toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) signaling and reverse neuropathic pain expressed shortly after chronic constriction injury. The present studies reveal that the TLR4 contributes to neuropathic pain in another major model (spinal nerve ligation) and to long established (2-4 months) neuropathic pain, not just to pain shortly after nerve damage. Additionally, analyses of plasma levels of (+)-naloxone after subcutaneous administration indicate that (+)-naloxone has comparable pharmacokinetics to (-)-naloxone with a relatively short half-life. This finding accounts for the rapid onset and short duration of allodynia reversal produced by subcutaneous (+)-naloxone. Given that toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) has also recently been implicated in neuropathic pain, cell lines transfected with either TLR4 or TLR2, necessary co-signaling molecules, and a reporter gene were used to define whether (+)-naloxone effects could be accounted for by actions at TLR2 in addition to TLR4. (+)-Naloxone inhibited signaling by TLR4 but not TLR2. These studies provide evidence for broad involvement of TLR4 in neuropathic pain, both early after nerve damage and months later. Additional, they provide further support for the TLR4 inhibitor (+)-naloxone as a novel candidate for the treatment of neuropathic pain. PERSPECTIVE: These studies demonstrated that (+)-naloxone, a systemically available, blood-brain barrier permeable, small molecule TLR4 inhibitor can reverse neuropathic pain in rats, even months after nerve injury. These findings suggest that (+)-naloxone, or similar compounds, be considered as a candidate novel, first-in-class treatment for neuropathic pain.",

        "abstract": "Aromatic/heterocyclic sulfonamides act as strong inhibitors of the zinc enzyme carbonic anhydrase (CA; EC 4.2.1.1), but the presently available compounds do not generally discriminate between the 14 isozymes isolated in higher vertebrates. Thus, clinically used drugs from this class of pharmacological agents show many undesired side effects due to unselective inhibition of all CA isozymes present in a tissue/organ. Here we propose a new approach for the selective in vivo inhibition of membrane-bound versus cytosolic CA isozymes with a new class of positively charged, membrane-impermeant sulfonamides. This approach is based on the attachment of trisubstituted-pyridinium-methylcarboxy moieties (obtained from 2,4, 6-trisubstituted-pyrylium salts and glycine) to the molecules of classical aromatic/heterocyclic sulfonamides possessing free amino, imino, hydrazino, or hydroxyl groups in their molecules. Efficient in vitro inhibition (in the nanomolar range) was observed with some of the new derivatives against three investigated CA isozymes: i.e., hCA I, hCA II (cytosolic forms), and bCA IV (membrane-bound isozyme) (h = human isozyme; b = bovine isozyme). Due to their salt-like character, the new type of inhibitors reported here, unlike the classical, clinically used compounds (such as acetazolamide, methazolamide, and ethoxzolamide), are unable to penetrate through biological membranes, as shown by ex vivo and in vivo perfusion experiments in rats. The level of bicarbonate excreted into the urine of the experimental animals perfused with solutions of the new and classical inhibitors undoubtedly proved that: (i) when using the new type of positively charged sulfonamides, only the membrane-bound enzyme (CA IV) was inhibited, whereas the cytosolic isozymes (CA I and II) were not affected; (ii) in the experiments in which the classical compounds (acetazolamide, benzolamide, etc.) were used, unselective inhibition of all CA isozymes (I, II, and IV) has been evidenced.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Alzheimer s disease is characterized by a dysfunction of central cholinergic systems and is treated by inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase (AChE). This study tests the effect of two AChE inhibitors in therapeutic use, rivastigmine and donepezil, in mice that are devoid of AChE (AChE-/- mice). Rivastigmine is an inhibitor of both AChE and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) whereas donepezil is a selective inhibitor of AChE. METHODS: We have used in vivo microdialysis to investigate the effects of the two drugs on the extracellular concentration of acetylcholine (ACh) in the hippocampus of AChE-/- mice. RESULTS: Extracellular ACh levels in the hippocampus were 30-fold elevated in AChE-/- mice compared to wild-type (AChE+/+) animals. Infusion of rivastigmine (1 and 10 microM) caused a further doubling of ACh levels in AChE-/- mice within 90-120 min. In contrast, infusion of donepezil (1 microM) did not affect hippocampal ACh levels in AChE-/- mice although it increased ACh levels more than twofold in wild-type mice. CONCLUSIONS: In the absence of AChE, rivastigmine enhances the levels of extracellular ACh by inhibiting BChE. This finding may be of therapeutic relevance because BChE activity is preserved, but AChE activity is strongly decreased, in late-stage Alzheimer s disease.",

        "abstract": "Endocrine therapy is first-line therapy for patients with estrogen receptor-positive or progesterone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer. Commonly used endocrine therapies are tamoxifen, megestrol acetate, and aromatase inhibitors. Although tamoxifen and megestrol acetate have a favorable therapeutic profile, there are risks associated with these agents. With tamoxifen, the partial agonist property can lead to thromboembolic events. An important adverse event of megestrol acetate is weight gain and fluid retention in some patients. The aromatase inhibitors are currently used as second-line therapy after tamoxifen failure. A recent study showed that anastrozole, an aromatase inhibitor, is as effective or even superior to tamoxifen when used as a first-line therapy. However, not all patients will respond to currently available therapies. A new class of drug, the estrogen receptor downregulators, has been developed. Fulvestrant, the first agent in this new class, not only induces the degradation of the estrogen receptor but also is an estrogen antagonist; further, its lack of agonist activity provides a better safety profile. Two phase III trials have proven that fulvestrant is at least as effective as anastrozole in postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer. Fulvestrant is an effective and safe endocrine therapy for postmenopausal women who have failed prior endocrine therapy.",

AM acts, via its major metabolite desethylamiodarone, in vitro and in vivo as a thyroid hormone receptor alpha(1) (TRalpha(1)) and TRbeta(1) antagonist. Here we investigate whether Dron and/or its metabolite debutyldronedarone inhibit T(3) binding to TRalpha(1) and TRbeta(1) in vitro and whether dronedarone behaves similarly to amiodarone in vivo. In vitro, Dron had a inhibitory effect of 14% on the binding of T(3) to TRalpha(1), but not on TRbeta(1). Desethylamiodarone inhibited T(3) binding to TRalpha(1) and TRbeta(1) equally. Debutyldronedarone inhibited T(3) binding to TRalpha(1) by 77%, but to TRbeta(1) by only 25%. In vivo, AM increased plasma TSH and rT(3), and decreased T(3). Dron decreased T(4) and T(3), rT(3) did not change, and TSH fell slightly. Plasma total cholesterol was increased by AM, but remained unchanged in Dron-treated animals. TRbeta(1)-dependent liver low density lipoprotein receptor protein and type 1 deiodinase activities decreased in AM-treated, but not in Dron-treated, animals. TRalpha(1)-mediated lengthening of the QTc interval was present in both AM- and Dron-treated animals.

        "abstract": "Dasatinib (BMS-354825) is a novel, oral, potent, multi-targeted kinase inhibitor of Bcr-Abl and Src family kinases (SFK) and is a promising cancer therapeutic agent. Preclinical data indicate that dasatinib is 325-fold more potent than imatinib against cells expressing wild-type Bcr-Abl, and that dasatinib is active against 18 of 19 Bcr-Abl mutations known to cause imatinib resistance. Phase I clinical data show that dasatinib is well tolerated and highly effective for the treatment of imatinib-resistant/imatinib-intolerant chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and Philadelphia chromosome-positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia. However, the molecular mechanism of action of dasatinib is not fully understood. In this study, we confirm that dasatinib inhibits tyrosine phosphorylation of SFKs, including Src, Hck, and Lyn, in K562 human CML cells. Significantly, downstream signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (Stat5) signaling is also blocked by dasatinib as shown by decreases in levels of phosphorylated Stat5 and Stat5 DNA-binding activities. In addition, dasatinib down-regulates expression of Stat5 target genes, including Bcl-x, Mcl-1, and cyclin D1. Consistent with these results, blockade of Stat5 signaling by dasatinib is accompanied by inhibition of cell proliferation and induction of apoptosis. Surprisingly, Stat5 DNA-binding activities are enhanced with increasing cell density, which is associated with resistance to apoptosis by dasatinib. Our findings indicate that inhibition of Stat5 signaling downstream of Bcr-Abl/SFKs contributes to the action of dasatinib, and, conversely, that increasing cell density up-regulates Stat5 activation and confers resistance to dasatinib. Moreover, the level of phosphorylated Stat5 in CML cells represents a mechanistically relevant biomarker for monitoring inhibition of Bcr-Abl signaling by dasatinib in CML patients using convenient immunocytochemical assays.",

        "abstract": "It has long been known that small changes to the structure of the R(2) side chain of nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates can dramatically affect their potency for inhibiting bone resorption in vitro and in vivo, although the reason for these differences in antiresorptive potency have not been explained at the level of a pharmacological target. Recently, several nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates were found to inhibit osteoclast-mediated bone resorption in vitro by inhibiting farnesyl diphosphate synthase, thereby preventing protein prenylation in osteoclasts. In this study, we examined the potency of a wider range of nitrogen-containing bisphosphonates, including the highly potent, heterocycle-containing zoledronic acid and minodronate (YM-529). We found a clear correlation between the ability to inhibit farnesyl diphosphate synthase in vitro, to inhibit protein prenylation in cell-free extracts and in purified osteoclasts in vitro, and to inhibit bone resorption in vivo. The activity of recombinant human farnesyl diphosphate synthase was inhibited at concentrations &gt; or = 1 nM zoledronic acid or minodronate, the order of potency (zoledronic acid approximately equal to minodronate &gt; risedronate &gt; ibandronate &gt; incadronate &gt; alendronate &gt; pamidronate) closely matching the order of antiresorptive potency. Furthermore, minor changes to the structure of the R(2) side chain of heterocycle-containing bisphosphonates, giving rise to less potent inhibitors of bone resorption in vivo, also caused a reduction in potency up to approximately 300-fold for inhibition of farnesyl diphosphate synthase in vitro. These data indicate that farnesyl diphosphate synthase is the major pharmacological target of these drugs in vivo, and that small changes to the structure of the R(2) side chain alter antiresorptive potency by affecting the ability to inhibit farnesyl diphosphate synthase.",

        "abstract": "Although several treatment options are available to reduce hyperglycemia, only about half of individuals with diagnosed diabetes mellitus (DM) achieve recommended glycemic targets. New agents that reduce blood glucose concentrations by novel mechanisms and have acceptable safety profiles are needed to improve glycemic control and reduce the complications associated with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). The renal sodium-glucose co-transporter 2 (SGLT2) is responsible for reabsorption of most of the glucose filtered by the kidney. Inhibitors of SGLT2 lower blood glucose independent of the secretion and action of insulin by inhibiting renal reabsorption of glucose, thereby promoting the increased urinary excretion of excess glucose. Canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and empagliflozin are SGLT2 inhibitors approved as treatments for T2DM in the United States, Europe, and other countries. Canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and empagliflozin increase renal excretion of glucose and improve glycemic parameters in patients with T2DM when used as monotherapy or in combination with other antihyperglycemic agents. Treatment with SGLT2 inhibitors is associated with weight reduction, lowered blood pressure, and a low intrinsic propensity to cause hypoglycemia. Overall, canagliflozin, dapagliflozin, and empagliflozin are well tolerated. Cases of genital infections and, in some studies, urinary tract infections have been more frequent in canagliflozin-, dapagliflozin-, and empagliflozin-treated patients compared with those receiving placebo. Evidence from clinical trials suggests that SGLT2 inhibitors are a promising new treatment option for T2DM.",

This enzyme preparation was then characterized for several of its properties. Michaelis-Menten constants for the substrates, p-aminobenzoic acid and dihydropteridine diphosphate were estimated to be 2.5 and 91 microM, respectively. In an optimized assay, the reaction product, dihydropteroic acid, competitively inhibited the enzyme activity with a Ki of 81 microM. However, neither dihydropteroic acid nor tetrahydrofolate, products further downstream in the biosynthetic pathway inhibited enzymatic activity. This appears to be the first report of product inhibition of DHPS from a higher plant. The relative inhibitory properties of several sulfonamides, analogues of p-aminobenzoic acid, were also examined. The substitutions on the amide nitrogen of the sulfonamides influenced the degree of inhibition; thus I50 values for the inhibition of the DHPS activity by sulfanilamide, sulfacetamide and sulfadiazine were estimated to be 18.6, 9.6 and 4.2 microM, respectively.

In anchorage-dependent cells, the PAI-1 gene was regulated by cell adhesion. PAI-1 gene expression was induced more evidently in cells adhered to the culture plate than in nonadherent cells. In this study, we investigated the signal pathway of the PAI-1 gene expression regulated by cell adhesion. We found the induction of both PAI-1 mRNA and protein, when cells adhered to culture dish, was inhibited by the PI-3 kinase specific inhibitors (Ly294002 and wortmannin). The cells seeded on collagen-1 coated plate with low serum further demonstrated that the PAI-1 gene expression was prolonged by the cell adhesion. The above-mentioned PI-3 kinase specific inhibitors also blocked the PAI-1 maintenance when cell adhered to collagen-1 coated plate. In addition, we found that both PI-3 kinase and its downstream molecule, Akt, were activated more evidently in adherent cells than in nonadherent cells. Furthermore, we transfected antisense oligodeoxynucleotides of Akt (AS-ODN-Akt) into cells to block the expression of Akt and found that the induction of PAI-1 mRNA was also inhibited. Hence, we conclude that the induction of PAI-1 gene expression is cell adhesion dependent and is through PI-3 kinase and Akt activation.",

        "title": "Sulbactam forms only minimal amounts of irreversible acrylate-enzyme with SHV-1 beta-lactamase.",
        "abstract": "Sulbactam is a mechanism-based inhibitor of beta-lactamase enzymes used in clinical practice. It undergoes a complex series of chemical reactions in the active site that have been studied extensively in the past three decades. However, the actual species that gives rise to inhibition in a clinical setting has not been established. Recent studies by our group, using Raman microscopy and X-ray crystallography, have found that large quantities of enamine-based acyl-enzyme species are present within minutes in single crystals of SHV-1 beta-lactamases which can lead to significant inhibition. The enamines are formed by breakdown of the cyclic beta-lactam structures with further transformations leading to imine formation and subsequent isomerization to cis and/or trans enamines. Another favored form of inhibition arises from attack on the imine by a second nucleophilic amino acid side chain, e.g., from serine 130, to form a cross-linked species in the active site that can degrade to an acrylate-like species irreversibly bound to the enzyme. Thus, the imine is at a branch point on the reaction pathway. Using sulbactam and 6,6-dideuterated sulbactam we follow these alternate paths in WT and E166A SHV-1 beta-lactamase by means of Raman microscopic studies on single enzyme crystals. For the unlabeled sulbactam, the Raman data show the presence of an acrylate-like species, probably 3-serine acrylate, several hours after the reaction is started in the crystal. However, for the 6,6-dideutero analogue the acrylate signature appears on the time scale of minutes. The Raman signatures, principally an intense feature near 1530 cm-1, are assigned based on quantum mechanical calculations on model compounds that mimic acrylate species in the active site. The different time scales observed for acrylate-like product formation are ascribed to different rates of reaction involving the imine intermediate. It is proposed that for the unsubstituted sulbactam the conversion from imine to enamine, which involves breaking a C-H bond, is aided by quantum mechanical tunneling. For the 6,6-dideutero-sulbactam the same step involves breaking a C-D bond, which has little or no assistance from tunneling. Consequently the conversion to enamines is slower, and a higher population of imine results, presenting the opportunity for the competing reaction with the second nucleophile, serine 130 being the prime candidate. The hydrolysis of the resulting cross-linked intermediate leads to the observed rapid buildup of the acrylate product in the Raman spectra from the dideutero analogue. The protocol used here, essentially running the reactions with the two forms of sulbactam in parallel, provides an element of control and enables us to conclude that, for the unsubstituted sulbactam, the formation of the cross-linked intermediate and the final irreversible acrylate product is not a significant route to inhibition of SHV-1.",

This reaction is called aging. The effect of the four mono- and bisquaternary ammonium compounds tetramethylammonium (TMA), hexamethonium, decamethonium and suxamethonium on the reactivatability of soman-inhibited, solubilized AChE from human erythrocytes was investigated in vitro. All compounds were reversible inhibitors of AChE; the respective dissociation constants and the type of inhibition exhibited considerable differences. The affinities to both the active and the allosteric site were considerably higher for suxamethonium (Kii 81.3 microM; Ki 15.9 microM) and decamethonium (Kii 15.4 microM; Ki 4.4 microM) than for TMA (Kii 1 mM; Ki 289.6 microM) and hexamethonium (Kii 4.5 mM; Ki 331.8 microM). The reactivation experiments were performed in a four-step procedure (soman-inhibition at 0 degree and pH 10, aging at 37 degrees and pH 7.3, reactivation by the oxime HI 6 at 37 degrees and pH 7.3 followed by AChE assay). After these four steps (total duration 55 min), AChE was inhibited by soman to 95-100%. HI 6 could reactivate about 20% of the inhibited enzyme. All effectors increased the AChE reactivatability by HI 6 when added before aging was started. The maximal increase in reactivatability was higher in the presence of 1.6 mM suxamethonium (+35.8%) and 150 microM decamethonium (+40%) than of 22 mM TMA (+22.5%) and 8.3 mM hexamethonium (+19.2%). If the effectors were added after 5 min of aging they increased the activity of soman-inhibited AChE, but to a considerably smaller extent than HI 6. A good correlation of the respective Kii values and the effective concentrations of these drugs was observed, indicating that an allosteric binding site of AChE might be involved in the protective effect of these drugs.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Azelastine, oxatomide, and ketotifen are used for patients with allergic diseases. These drugs inhibit the release of chemical mediators including the leukotrienes; however, the mechanism involved is unclear. OBJECTIVE: To clarify the mechanism of inhibition, we investigated the effects of three drugs on the function of phospholipase A2, 5-lipoxygenase, leukotriene C4 synthase, and leukotriene A4 hydrolase, which are all catabolic enzymes involved in synthesizing leukotriene C4 and leukotriene B4 in rat basophilic leukemia (RBL)-1 cells. METHODS AND RESULTS: The production of leukotriene C4 and leukotriene B4 was measured by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). All three drugs inhibited the production of leukotriene C4 and leukotriene B4 when cells were stimulated with A23187. All three drugs also inhibited the A23187-stimulated release of 3H-arachidonic acid from membrane phospholipids. Azelastine inhibited the production of leukotriene C4, but not leukotriene B4, when either arachidonic acid or leukotriene A4 free acid was used as the substrate in our cell free system. Oxatomide and ketotifen did not inhibit the synthesis of either leukotriene C4 or leukotriene B4 in the same cell free study. CONCLUSION: Results indicated that oxatomide and ketotifen inhibit the production of leukotriene C4 and leukotriene B4 by inhibiting phospholipase A2 activity, whereas, azelastine inhibits the leukotriene C4 production by inhibiting phospholipase A2 and leukotriene C4 synthase.",

The purpose of this study was to investigate the effect of glucagon on homocysteine metabolism in the rat. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with 4 mg/kg/day (3 injections per day) glucagon for 2 days while control rats received vehicle injections. Glucagon treatment resulted in a 30% decrease in total plasma homocysteine and increased hepatic activities of glycine N-methyltransferase, cystathionine beta-synthase, and cystathionine gamma-lyase. Enzyme activities of the remethylation pathway were unaffected. The 90% elevation in activity of cystathionine beta-synthase was accompanied by a 2-fold increase in its mRNA level. Hepatocytes prepared from glucagon-injected rats exported less homocysteine, when incubated with methionine, than did hepatocytes of saline-treated rats. Flux through cystathionine beta-synthase was increased 5-fold in hepatocytes isolated from glucagon-treated rats as determined by production of (14)CO(2) and alpha-[1-(14)C]ketobutyrate from l-[1-(14)C]methionine. Methionine transport was elevated 2-fold in hepatocytes isolated from glucagon-treated rats resulting in increased hepatic methionine levels. Hepatic concentrations of S-adenosylmethionine and S-adenosylhomocysteine, allosteric activators of cystathionine beta-synthase, were also increased following glucagon treatment. These results indicate that glucagon can regulate plasma homocysteine through its effects on the hepatic transsulfuration pathway.",

        "abstract": "Enzyme activity measurement showed that L-ascorbic acid (vitamin C (Vc)) competitively inhibits the hyaluronan degradation by Streptococcus pneumoniae hyaluronate lyase. The complex crystal structure of this enzyme with Vc was determined at 2.0 A resolution. One Vc molecule was found to bind to the active site of the enzyme. The Vc carboxyl group provides the negative charges that lead the molecule into the highly positively charged cleft of the enzyme. The Vc ring system forms hydrophobic interactions with the side chain of Trp-292, which is one of the aromatic patch residues of this enzyme responsible for the selection of the cleavage sites on the substrate chain. The binding of Vc inhibits the substrate binding at hyaluronan 1, 2, and 3 (HA1, HA2, and HA3) catalytic positions. The high concentration of Vc in human tissues probably provides a low level of natural resistance to the pneumococcal invasion. This is the first time that Vc the direct inhibition on the bacterial \"spreading factor\" was reported, and Vc is also the first chemical that has been shown experimentally to have an inhibitory effect on bacterial hyaluronate lyase. These studies also highlight the possible structural requirement for the design of a stronger inhibitor of bacterial hyaluronate lyase.",

        "abstract": "We have evaluated the inhibition of testicular hyaluronidase and hyaluronan lyase by L-ascorbic acid and chemical analogs. We observed that L-ascorbic acid, D-isoascorbic acid and dehydroascorbic acid inhibited both types of enzymes, but showed stronger effects towards hyaluronan lyase. But these compounds were observed to degrade the substrate, hyaluronan, by themselves. Of the other ascorbic acid analogs tested, saccharic acid inhibited hyaluronan lyase, while not affecting the enzymatic activity of testicular hyaluronidase, nor affecting the physic-chemical stability of hyaluronan. This is the first compound, to our knowledge, to be shown to possess such selective inhibition. Therefore, we propose that saccharic acid could serve as a lead compound for the development of potent and selective inhibitors of bacterial hyaluronan lyase or of polysaccharide lyase enzymes in general as we observed this compound to be capable of inhibiting chondroitinase ABC in addition to hyaluronan lyase.",

        "abstract": "The main resistance mechanism for fluconazole in Candida krusei is the diminished sensitivity of the target enzyme cytochrome P450 sterol 14 alpha-demethylase (CYP51) to inhibition by azole agents. An alternative mechanism of resistance, efflux-pump activity, has been proposed. The aim of our study was to find out the possible contribution of efflux-pumps in conferring resistance to fluconazole in 33 C. krusei isolates from different clinical sources. The activity of efflux-pumps was checked using the inhibitor CCCP (carbonyl cyanide 3-chloro-phenylhydrazone), which decreases the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) when resistance is attributed. We established a concentration of 0.5 microg/ml of CCCP. The susceptibility patterns of our isolates for five antifungal drugs (amphotericin B, fluconazole, itraconazole, flucytosine and voriconazole) were determined according to an NCCLS M27-A2 protocol modification (Sensititre Yeast One). We tested all the strains before and after adding CCCP to the RPMI medium. The MIC90s and ranges of the drugs were identical before and after addition of CCCP. The MIC for fluconazole was higher than for the other antifungals. The new triazoles were active and the MICs were lower, although this should be interpreted carefully as the drugs showed different cut-offs. Only one isolate showed a two-fold decrease in MIC to fluconazole when CCCP was added. We did not find any multi-resistant strains. According to our study with C. krusei, CCCP-inhibited efflux-pumps do not play a significant role in resistance to fluconazole.",

        "abstract": "Hyaluronidases are enzymes that degrade hyaluronan, an important component of the extracellular matrix. The mammalian hyaluronidases are considered to be involved in many (patho)physiological processes like fertilization, tumor growth, and metastasis. Bacterial hyaluronidases, also termed hyaluronate lyases, contribute to the spreading of microorganisms in tissues. Such roles for hyaluronidases suggest that inhibitors could be useful pharmacological tools. Potent and selective inhibitors are not known to date, although L-ascorbic acid has been reported to be a weak inhibitor of Streptococcus pneumoniae hyaluronate lyase (SpnHL). The x-ray structure of SpnHL complexed with L-ascorbic acid has been elucidated suggesting that additional hydrophobic interactions might increase inhibitory activity. Here we show that L-ascorbic acid 6-hexadecanoate (Vcpal) is a potent inhibitor of both streptococcal and bovine testicular hyaluronidase (BTH). Vcpal showed strong inhibition of Streptococcus agalactiae hyaluronate lyase with an IC(50) of 4 microM and weaker inhibition of SpnHL and BTH with IC(50) values of 100 and 56 microM, respectively. To date, Vcpal has proved to be one of the most potent inhibitors of hyaluronidase. We also determined the x-ray structure of the SpnHL-Vcpal complex and confirmed the hypothesis that additional hydrophobic interactions with Phe-343, His-399, and Thr-400 in the active site led to increased inhibition. A homology structural model of BTH was also generated to suggest binding modes of Vcpal to this hyaluronidase. The long alkyl chain seemed to interact with an extended, hydrophobic channel formed by mostly conserved amino acids Ala-84, Leu-91, Tyr-93, Tyr-220, and Leu-344 in BTH.",

Using [125I](Sar1,Ile8) angiotensin II as radioligand, affinity constants were determined in liver and adrenal rat and marmoset, human adrenal and in rat aortic smooth muscle cells. In all tissues tested, valsartan had a greater affinity for the AT1 receptor than losartan (on average 5-fold). The affinities of both antagonists were up to 30 times weaker in the dog tissues [3H]Valsartan bound with high affinity (Kd 1.44 nmol/l) to the rat aortic smooth muscle cell AT1 receptor. Binding was saturable and reversible. Non-specific binding was low (10%). Reports that [3H]losartan binds to a non-angiotensin II binding site in rat liver and in other tissues could be confirmed. [3H]Valsartan on the other hand bound only to the AT1 receptor. Using a competition binding assay with [3H]losartan on rat liver membranes it could be shown that valsartan can bind to the 'losartan binding site', but at a 10,000-fold less affinity than for the AT1 receptor. Valsartan is therefore a highly specific and selective antagonist of the AT1 receptor. Due to its high affinity and low non-specific binding it is a suitable radioactive antagonist for the study of the distribution and function of the angiotensin AT1 receptor.",

It is revealed through the structure that the active sites of the group-1 neuraminidases, which contain the N1 subtype, have a very different three-dimensional structure from those of group-2 neuraminidases. The key difference is in the 150-loop cavity adjacent to the conserved active site in neuraminidase.

        "title": "Preclinical overview of brinzolamide.",
        "abstract": "The development of topically active carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (CAIs) is a significant recent achievement in glaucoma medical treatment. Brinzolamide, the newest topical CAI, exhibits selectivity, high affinity, and potent inhibitory activity for the carbonic anhydrase type II isozyme (CA-II), which is involved in aqueous humor secretion. These characteristics, along with good ocular bioavailability, make brinzolamide maximally effective in lowering intraocular pressure (IOP) by locally inhibiting CA-II in the ciliary processes and suppressing aqueous humor secretion. Notable among its attributes as a safe and efficacious glaucoma drug is brinzolamide's superior ocular comfort profile because of its optimized suspension formulation at physiologic pH. The degree of tolerability in the eye is considered an important determinant of a patient's willingness to comply with the dosing regimen for a long-term glaucoma medication. Results from the preclinical pharmacologic evaluation of brinzolamide indicated that it acts specifically to inhibit CA without significant other pharmacologic actions that could introduce undesired side effects. Moreover, the typical side effects associated with systemically administered CAIs are expected to occur at a lower incidence or not occur at all with brinzolamide, as its therapeutic dose and low systemic absorption do not produce a problematic level of systemic CA inhibition. Brinzolamide's long tissue half-life in the eye, particularly in the iris-ciliary body, favors a prolonged duration of IOP lowering. This was substantiated in clinical trials, which showed that twice-daily brinzolamide provides as significant an IOP reduction as three-times-daily brinzolamide or dorzolamide in a relatively high percentage of patients. Brinzolamide has been shown by the laser Doppler flowmetry technique to improve blood flow to the optic nerve head in pigmented rabbits after topical administration, without producing an increase of blood pCO2, indicating a potential for a local vasodilatory effect involving the optic nerve head circulation. The mean concentration of brinzolamide found in the retina of pigmented rabbits (0.338 microg equivalents/g) after a single dose of 14C-brinzolamide is sufficient to inhibit CA-II. These data suggest that topical brinzolamide could improve the blood flow in the optic nerve head in humans should it inhibit carbonic anhydrase in that vascular bed. Brinzolamide is a new topically active CAI that is safe and efficacious for reducing intraocular pressure. It offers the convenience of topical dose administration and greater freedom from side effects related to the inhibition of CA seen with the systemic administration of CAIs. Its formulation has been optimized to provide greater comfort upon instillation, and this can result in a higher compliance rate by the patient. Results of studies in animals show that brinzolamide has promise for increasing blood flow to the optic nerve head; however, this requires further assessment in the clinic. Brinzolamide represents a significant technical achievement and an important addition to the medical treatment of glaucoma as both a primary and an adjunctive drug.",

The exact mechanism by which hyperphosphatemia increases mortality risk is unknown, but it may relate to enhanced cardiovascular calcification. The National Kidney Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (K/DOQI) Clinical Practice Guidelines for Bone Metabolism and Disease in Chronic Kidney Disease recommends maintenance of serum phosphorus below 5.5 mg/dL, calcium-phosphorus (Ca x P) product less than 55 mg(2)/dL(2), intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) 150 pg/mL to 300 pg/mL, and bicarbonate (HCO(3)) greater than 22 mEq/L. Although calcium-based phosphate binders (CBPB) are cost effective, there are long-term safety concerns pertaining to their postulated role in the progression of cardiovascular calcification. Sevelamer hydrochloride has been recommended as an alternative noncalcium phosphate binder. Results from the Calcium Acetate Renagel Evaluation (CARE) study indicate that calcium acetate is more effective than sevelamer hydrochloride in controlling serum phosphorous, Ca x P product, and HCO(3) in hemodialysis patients. In the Treat-to-Goal study, dialysis patients treated with sevelamer hydrochloride had slower progression of coronary and aortic calcification than patients treated with CBPB. The mechanism underlying the beneficial effect of sevelamer hydrochloride is unknown but may relate to decreased calcium loading, or to dramatic reductions in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol in sevelamer hydrochloride-treated patients. At present, evidence incriminating CBPB in the progression of cardiovascular calcification in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) remains largely circumstantial. As calcium acetate is more efficacious and cost effective than sevelamer hydrochloride, it remains an accepted first-line phosphate binder. This review examines these issues and provides rational guidelines for the use of CBPB in patients on maintenance hemodialysis.",

Inhibition data of the cytosolic isozymes CA I and CA II and the membrane-bound isozyme CA IV with these inhibitors are also provided for comparison. Several low nanomolar CA V inhibitors were detected (KI values in the range of 4-15 nM), most of them belonging to the acylated sulfanilamide, ureido-benzenesulfonamide, 1,3,4-thiadiazole-2-sulfonamide, and aminobenzolamide type of compounds.

Some of the investigated sulfonamides, such as the ureido-benzenesulfonamides and the acylated sulfanilamides showed higher affinity for CA V than for the other isozymes, CA II included, which is a remarkable result, since most compounds investigated up to now inhibited the cytosolic isozyme CA II better.

This enzyme catalyzes the formation of mevalonate, which is also the precursor of isoprenoid moieties, such as farnesol and geraniol, that are incorporated into several molecules essential for tumor cell signaling. Here, we describe that pretreatment with a non-cytotoxic concentration of lovastatin (10 microM) dramatically inhibited the metastatic ability of F311 mammary carcinoma cells in syngeneic BALB/c mice. Similarly, daily i.p. treatment of animals with a well-tolerated dose of lovastatin (10 mg/kg/day) significantly reduced the number of experimental lung metastases. In vitro, incubation of F3II monolayers in the presence of lovastatin caused a rounded-cell morphology. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed a lack of cortical actin organization, micrutubule disruption and inhibition of integrin-mediated focal contacts in lovastatin-treated cells. Exposure of F3II cells to lovastatin significantly inhibited tumor cell adhesion and migration, and coincubation with the cholesterol precursor mevalonate prevented these effects. Lovastatin reduced membrane localization of Rho protein, a signaling molecule involved in the regulation of actin-based cell motility that needs geranylation for membrane association and activation. In addition, lovastatin induced a dose-dependent inhibition in the secretion of urokinase, a key proteolytic enzyme during tumor invasion and metastasis, and a significant increase of tissue-type plasminogen activator, a marker of good prognosis in mammary cancer. These data suggest that antimetastatic properties of lovastatin are strongly associated with alterations in cytoskeleton organization and the consequent modulation of adhesion, motility and proteolysis.",

The spectrum of beta-lactamase inhibition by vaborbactam and the impact of bacterial efflux and permeability on its activity were determined using a panel of strains with beta-lactamases cloned from various classes and a panel of Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase 3 (KPC-3)-producing isogenic strains with various combinations of efflux and porin mutations. Vaborbactam is a potent inhibitor of class A carbapenemases, such as KPC, as well as an inhibitor of other class A (CTX-M, SHV, TEM) and class C (P99, MIR, FOX) beta-lactamases. Vaborbactam does not inhibit class D or class B carbapenemases. When combined with meropenem, vaborbactam had the highest potency compared to the potencies of vaborbactam in combination with other antibiotics against strains producing the KPC beta-lactamase. Consistent with broad-spectrum beta-lactamase inhibition, vaborbactam reduced the meropenem MICs for engineered isogenic strains of K. pneumoniae with increased meropenem MICs due to a combination of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase production, class C beta-lactamase production, and reduced permeability due to porin mutations. Vaborbactam crosses the outer membrane of K. pneumoniae using both OmpK35 and OmpK36, but OmpK36 is the preferred porin. Efflux by the multidrug resistance efflux pump AcrAB-TolC had a minimal impact on vaborbactam activity. Investigation of the vaborbactam concentration necessary for restoration of meropenem potency showed that vaborbactam at 8 mug/ml results in meropenem MICs of &lt;=2 mug/ml in the most resistant engineered strains containing multiple mutations. Vaborbactam is a highly active beta-lactamase inhibitor that restores the activity of meropenem and other beta-lactam antibiotics in beta-lactamase-producing bacteria, particularly KPC-producing carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae.",

        "abstract": "The androgen receptor (AR) activity of listed chemicals, so called SPEED 98, by the Ministry of the Environment, Japan, and structurally related chemicals was characterized using MDA-kb2 human breast cancer cells stably expressing an androgen-responsive luciferase reporter gene, MMTV-luc. Since our results suggested that chemicals with diverse chemical structures were capable of disrupting the endocrine systems mediated by AR, a comparative molecular field analysis (CoMFA) model was developed to analyze the structural requirements necessary to disrupt AR function. A significant CoMFA model with r(2)=0.825 and q(2)=0.332 was developed for AR antagonist activity of 35 pure antagonists excluding procymidone. On the other hand, a good CoMFA model with r(2)=0.983 and q(2)=0.555 was obtained for antagonist activity of 13 chemicals with both agonist and antagonist activities. The steric and electrostatic properties were sufficient to describe the structural requirements for AR antagonist activity. In addition, the structural difference of AR agonists and antagonists was explained based on CoMFA results and the AR-LBD crystal structure. As several ERalpha agonists such as diethylstilbestrol (DES) acted as AR antagonists, the surface area of the AR ligand-binding domain (LBD) was compared with that of the ERalpha-LBD based on their reported crystal structures to analyze how those ligands interact with LBDs. The surface area of AR-LBD was shown to be smaller than that of ERalpha-LBD and therefore compounds with both estrogenic and antiandrogenic activities can fit well into the ERalpha-LBD but may protrude from the AR-LBD. It is likely that this subtle difference of the surface areas of the LBDs determines whether an ERalpha agonist acts as an AR antagonist or an agonist.",

        "abstract": "Proton pump inhibitor (PPI)-induced inhibition of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase 1 (DDAH1), with consequent accumulation of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), might explain the increased cardiovascular risk with PPI use. However, uncertainty exists regarding whether clinical PPI concentrations significantly inhibit DDAH1 under linear initial rate conditions, and whether PPI-induced DDAH1 inhibition significantly increases ADMA in humans. DDAH1 inhibition by esomeprazole, omeprazole, pantoprazole, lansoprazole and rabeprazole was determined by quantifying DDAH1-mediated L-citrulline formation in vitro. Plasma ADMA was measured in PPI users (n = 134) and non-users (n = 489) in the Hunter Community Study (HCS). At clinical PPI concentrations (0.1-10 mumol/L), DDAH1 retained &gt;80% activity vs. baseline. A significant, reversible, time-dependent inhibition was observed with lansoprazole (66% activity at 240 min, P = 0.034) and rabeprazole (25% activity at 240 min, P &lt; 0.001). In regression analysis, PPI use was not associated with ADMA in HCS participants (beta 0.012, 95% CI -0.001 to 0.025, P = 0.077). Furthermore, there were no differences in ADMA between specific PPIs (P = 0.748). At clinical concentrations, PPIs are weak, reversible, DDAH1 inhibitors in vitro. The lack of significant associations between PPIs and ADMA in HCS participants questions the significance of DDAH1 inhibition as a mechanism explaining the increased cardiovascular risk reported with PPI use.",

        "abstract": "Aripiprazole is a novel antipsychotic drug, which displays partial agonist activity at the dopamine D(2) receptor. Aripiprazole has been extensively studied pre-clinically, both in vitro and in vivo, and these results have been correlated with clinical findings. However, aripiprazole is metabolised differently in rats and man and these metabolites may contribute to the profile of aripiprazole observed in vivo. We have therefore studied the interaction of aripiprazole and its principal rat and human metabolites in both in vitro models of dopamine hD(2) receptor function and affinity, and of in vivo models of dopamine rat D(2) receptor function. The human metabolite displayed similar levels of partial agonist activity to aripiprazole at the dopamine hD(2) receptor and displayed similar behavioural profile to aripiprazole in vivo, suggesting that in man the metabolite may maintain the effects of aripiprazole. In contrast, the rat metabolite displayed antagonist activity both in vitro and in vivo. Thus care must be taken in ascribing effects seen in vivo with aripiprazole in rats to dopamine D(2) receptor partial agonist activity in man, and that care must also be taken in extrapolating effects seen in rats to man, particularly from long-term studies.",

        "abstract": "The role(s) of ascorbic acid in dopamine beta-hydroxylation was studied in primary cultures of bovine adrenomedullary chromaffin cells and in isolated bovine adrenomedullary chromaffin vesicles. Dopamine beta-hydroxylase activity was assessed by measuring the rate of conversion of tyramine to octopamine. The ascorbic acid content of chromaffin cells declined with time in culture and the dopamine beta-hydroxylase activity of ascorbate-depleted cells was low. Ascorbate additions to ascorbate-depleted cells increased both the intracellular ascorbate concentrations and the rates of dopamine beta-hydroxylation. Ascorbate uptake into the cells was rapid; however, the onset of enhanced octopamine synthesis by added ascorbate was delayed by several hours and closely followed the time course for accumulation of the newly taken up ascorbate into the chromaffin vesicle. The amount of octopamine synthesized by the chromaffin cells exceeded the intracellular ascorbate content and ascorbate levels were maintained during dopamine beta-hydroxylation in the absence of external ascorbate. This suggests an efficient recycling of ascorbate. In contrast to intact cells, ascorbic acid was depleted during octopamine synthesis in isolated chromaffin vesicles. The molar ratio of octopamine formed to ascorbate depleted was close to unity. Thus, the recycling of intravesicular ascorbate depends on an extravesicular factor(s). The depletion of intravesicular ascorbate during dopamine beta-hydroxylation was prevented by the addition of nonpermeant extravesicular electron donors such as ascorbate or glucoascorbate. This suggests that intravesicular ascorbate is maintained in the reduced state by electron transport across the vesicle membrane. These results are compatible with the hypothesis that both intra- and extravesicular ascorbate participate in the regulation of dopamine beta-hydroxylase. Intravesicular ascorbate is the cofactor for the enzyme. Cytosolic ascorbate is most likely the electron donor for the vesicle-membrane electron transport system which maintains the intravesicular cofactor concentration.",

        "abstract": "In in vitro receptor binding and synaptosomal uptake experiments the (+)-enantiomer of tramadol (CAS 148229-78-1) is specific for the mu-opioid receptor site and for the serotonin (5-HT) carrier, whereas the (-)-enantiomer (CAS 148229-79-2) has a higher affinity to the noradrenaline (NA) transporter. The antinociceptive active tramadol metabolite O-demethyltramadol (M1) shows a pronounced mu-selectivity. With respect to in vitro receptor binding experiments, the affinity of (+)-M1 to this opioid receptor subtype is more than two orders of magnitude higher than that of (+)-tramadol and approximately 1/10 that of morphine. Tramadol and M1 (and the enantiomers thereof) have no affinity to other receptor or uptake sites tested, e.g. 5-HT1A, 5-HT2, 5-HT3, NMDA (ligand: MK801), dopamine (DA)-D1, DA-D2, benzodiazepine, muscarine M1 and DA uptake (Ki &gt; or = 2 x 10(-5) mol/l). Ex vivo neurotransmitter determinations show that tramadol (46.4 mg/kg i.p.) elevates the DA metabolites 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) and homovanillic acid and enhances DA release in definite brain areas. The active enantiomer of the racemic tramadol is the (+)-enantiomer. (+)-Tramadol significantly enhances the turnover rate of DA. The enantioselective elevation of DOPAC by (+)-tramadol is antagonized by naloxone (2 x 5 mg/kg i.p.). Morphine (21.5 mg/kg i.p.) enhances the turnover of NA in definite brain areas. Neither the NA-specific uptake inhibition nisoxetine (31.6 mg/kg i.p.) nor tramadol (or its (+)- and (-)-enantiomers) have any influence on the NA turnover. Tramadol reduces the levels of 5-HT and its metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid. Morphine enhances, whereas tramadol reduces, 5-HT utilisation in the brain areas under assay. The 5-HT specific uptake inhibitor fluoxetine (20 mg/kg i.p.) shows the same influence on 5-HT turnover as tramadol. The results indicate that tramadol enhances DA turnover via an opioid mechanism. The interaction with the noradrenergic and serotonergic neurotransmission is clearly different from that of an opioid receptor agonist and closely resembles that of NA and 5-HT uptake inhibitors.",

        "abstract": "Although the mechanism of action of topiramate is not fully understood, its anticonvulsant properties may result, at least in part, from an interaction with AMPA/kainate receptors. We have recently shown that topiramate selectively inhibits postsynaptic responses mediated by GluR5 kainate receptors. To determine if this action of topiramate is relevant to the anticonvulsant effects of the drug in vivo, we determined the protective activity of topiramate against seizures induced by intravenous infusion of various ionotropic glutamate receptor agonists in mice. Topiramate (25-100 mg/kg, i.p.) produced a dose-dependent elevation in the threshold for clonic seizures induced by infusion of ATPA, a selective agonist of GluR5 kainate receptors. Topiramate was less effective in protecting against clonic seizures induced by kainate, a mixed agonist of AMPA and kainate receptors. Topiramate did not affect clonic seizures induced by AMPA or NMDA. In contrast, the thresholds for tonic seizures induced by higher doses of these various glutamate receptor agonists were all elevated by topiramate. Unlike topiramate, carbamazepine elevated the threshold for AMPA- but not ATPA-induced clonic seizures. Our results are consistent with the possibility that the effects of topiramate on clonic seizure activity are due to functional blockade of GluR5 kainate receptors. Protection from tonic seizures may be mediated by other actions of the drug. Together with our in vitro cellular electrophysiological results, the present observations strongly support a unique mechanism of action of topiramate, which involves GluR5 kainate receptors.",

In order to assess alpha-adrenergic autoreceptor sensitivity, the effects of clonidine, the alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonist, on plasma levels of the norepinephrine metabolite 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenethyleneglycol (MHPG), blood pressure (BP) and patient-rated sedation were measured in nine depressed patients before and during amitripytline treatment. Postsynaptic alpha-2 adrenergic receptor sensitivity was assessed by determining the growth hormone (GH) response to clonidine before and during treatment. Amitriptyline significantly attenuated the effects of clonidine on plasma MHPG, standing systolic BP, and sedation, indicating that alpha-2 adrenergic autoreceptors had become subsensitive. In addition, baseline plasma MHPG levels were significantly reduced. Amitriptyline had no effect on the GH response to clonidine.",

To investigate this further we have determined that, in eight mild atopic asthmatic subjects, terfenadine (180 mg), administered 3 hr pre-challenge, increases the geometric mean PC20 for histamine from 0.4 (range 0.03-3) mg/ml after placebo, to 20.2 (range 0.6-64) mg/ml following active treatment (P less than 0.0001).

The alkaloid morphine, in addition to being a mu-opioid receptor agonist, is a potent competitive inhibitor of 5-HT(3) receptors. We examined whether methadone, an opioid often used to treat morphine dependence, also exhibited 5-HT(3) receptor antagonist properties. Racemic (R/S)-methadone inhibited currents mediated by human homomeric 5-HT(3A) receptors (IC(50) = 14.1 +/- 2.5 microM). Incorporation of the 5-HT(3B) subunit into heteromeric 5-HT(3AB) receptors reduced the potency of inhibition by (R/S)-methadone (IC(50) = 41.1 +/- 0.9 microM). (R/S)-Methadone also increased apparent desensitization of both 5-HT(3) receptor subtypes. The inhibition of the 5-HT(3A) receptor was competitive; however, incorporation of the 5-HT(3B) subunit caused the appearance of inhibition that was insurmountable by 5-HT. In the absence of rapid desensitization, when dopamine was used as an agonist of 5-HT(3AB) receptors, the inhibition by (R/S)-methadone was voltage-dependent. The antagonist and desensitization-enhancing effects of (R/S)-methadone were shared by pure (R)- and (S)-methadone enantiomers, which had similar actions on 5-HT-evoked currents mediated by 5-HT(3) receptors. However, (R)-methadone exhibited a larger voltage-dependent inhibition of dopamine-evoked currents mediated by 5-HT(3AB) receptors than did (S)-methadone. Inhibition of 5-HT(3A) receptors by (R/S)-methadone was not influenced by voltage. Thus, methadone displays multimodal subunit-dependent antagonism of 5-HT(3) receptors.",

The aim of this study is to determine whether the methadone analgesic effect on neuropathic pain is achieved only by the agonism of the mu-opioid receptors or cooperatively with the antagonism of the NMDA receptors. To this purpose, in rats with neuropathic pain model of chronic constriction of one sciatic nerve (CCI rats), we administered methadone before or after opioid receptor blockade with naloxone and checked its effects on the spinal Wide Dynamic Range (WDR) neuron dynamics in three experimental conditions: on the spontaneous and noxious evoked neuronal activities in control rats (sham operated and naive); on iontophoretic NMDA induced neuronal hyperactivity in intact rats; on pain-related spontaneous and noxious evoked hyperactivities in CCI rats. The results, as from the spike-frequency analysis, show that: (i) in control rats, methadone inhibits the noxious evoked neuronal activity and naloxone prevents or reverses about 94% of methadone inhibitory effect; (ii) in intact rats, pretreated with naloxone, methadone reduces the NMDA induced neuronal hyperactivity; (iii) in CCI rats, methadone inhibits the neuronal spontaneous and noxious evoked hyperactivities, and naloxone prevents or reverses about 60% of methadone inhibitory effect. These findings allow to conclude that methadone inhibition of the noxious evoked activity in normal rats is achieved predominantly through the agonism of the mu-opioid receptors, while the inhibition of the pain-related hyperactivity in rats with signs of neuropathic pain (CCI rats), involves also the NMDA receptors antagonism.",

Some of these derivatives showed very high inhibitory potency against three carbonic anhydrase (CA) isozymes, such as CA I, CA II, and CA IV, involved in important physiological processes.

The valproyl derivative of acetazolamide (5-valproylamido-1,3,4-thiadiazole-2-sulfonamide, 6M) was one of the best hCA I and hCA II inhibitor in the series and exhibited very strong anticonvulsant properties in an MES test in mice. In consequence, other 1,3,4-thiadiazolesulfonamide derivatives possessing potent CA inhibitory properties and substituted with different alkyl/arylcarboxamido/sulfonamido/ureido moieties in the 5 position have been investigated for their anticonvulsant effects in the same animal model.

The affinities of various antidepressants for histamine receptors have only been partially determined in vitro and animal study. Positron emission tomography (PET) can clarify the in vivo dynamics of antidepressants at histamine receptors. OBJECTIVES: We performed human PET imaging with [11C]doxepin, a selective PET ligand of the histamine H1 receptor (H1R), to study the in vivo affinities of fluvoxamine and mirtazapine for the H1R. METHODS: The subjects were five male healthy Japanese volunteers. We performed cross-randomized PET imaging after single oral administration of fluvoxamine (25mg), mirtazapine (15 mg), or placebo. PET data were analyzed by region-of-interest and voxel-by-voxel analysis. We concurrently measured plasma drug concentrations, using liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry and subjective sleepiness. RESULTS: The binding potential ratio of mirtazapine in brain cortex was significantly lower than that of fluvoxamine or placebo. Fluvoxamine did not occupy the H1R, whereas H1R occupancy (H1RO) of mirtazapine reached 80-90 % in the cerebral neocortex. In the voxel-by-voxel analysis, the binding potential of mirtazapine was significantly lower than placebo in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, lateral temporal cortex, anterior cingulate gyrus, and posterior cingulate gyrus. The H1RO of mirtazapine depended on the plasma drug concentration (AUC(0-180 min)) and was related to subjective sleepiness. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate a low affinity of fluvoxamine and a very high affinity of mirtazapine for the human brain H1R in vivo. This study provides a basis for investigating the efficacy of new-generation antidepressants in central histamine systems.",

A 21-day treatment with mirtazapine (5 mg/kg/day, s.c., using osmotic minipumps) increased the spontaneous firing activity of locus coeruleus noradrenaline (NA) neurons. Their firing activity was back to normal 48 h after removing the minipump. However, this treatment did not modify the dose-response curve of the suppressant effect of the alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist clonidine on the firing activity of NA neurons. The spontaneous firing activity of dorsal raphe 5-HT neurons was also markedly increased in mirtazapine-treated rats, and was back to normal 48 h after removing of the minipump. The dose-response curve of the suppressant effect of clonidine on the firing activity of 5-HT neurons was altered in mirtazapine-treated rats. Furthermore, it was further shifted to the left after a 48-h washout. Long-term mirtazapine treatment did not modify the suppressant effects of microiontophoretically-applied NA and 5-HT on the firing activity of CA3 dorsal hippocampus pyramidal neurons. However, this mirtazapine treatment antagonized both the enhancing effect of a low dose (10 micrograms/kg, i.v.) and the reducing effect of a high dose (100 micrograms/kg, i.v.) of the alpha 2-adrenoceptor agonist clonidine on the effectiveness of the electrical stimulation of the ascending 5-HT pathway in suppressing the firing activity of dorsal hippocampus CA3 pyramidal neurons. After a 48-h washout, only the effect of the high dose of clonidine was attenuated, suggesting a desensitization of the terminal alpha 2-adrenergic heteroreceptor, but not of the terminal alpha 2-adrenergic autoreceptor. The decrease in the effectiveness of the stimulation upon increasing its frequency from 1 to 5 Hz (due to the activation of terminal 5-HT autoreceptors) was unaltered after the long-term mirtazapine treatment. In conclusion, the tonic activation of postsynaptic 5-HT receptor is enhanced by a 21-day treatment with mirtazapine, as a result of a sustained increase in 5-HT neuron firing activity in the presence of decreased function of alpha 2-adrenergic heteroreceptors located on 5-HT terminals in the dorsal hippocampus.",

        "abstract": "Mechanisms that have been proposed for peroxidase-catalyzed iodination require the utilization of 1 mol of H2O2 for organic binding of 1 mol of iodide. When we measured the stoichiometry of this reaction using thyroid peroxidase or lactoperoxidase at pH 7.0, we consistently obtained a ratio less than 1.0. This was shown to be attributable to catalase-like activity of these enzymes, resulting in unproductive cleavage of H2O2. This catalatic activity was completely iodide-dependent. To elucidate the mechanism of the iodide-dependent catalatic activity, the effects of various agents were investigated. The major observations may be summarized as follows: 1) The catalatic activity was inhibited in the presence of an iodine acceptor such as tyrosine. 2) The pseudohalide, SCN-, could not replace I- as a promoter of catalatic activity. 3) The inhibitory effects of the thioureylene drugs, methimazole and carbimazole, on the iodide-dependent catalatic activity were very similar to those reported previously for thyroid peroxidase-catalyzed iodination. 4) High concentrations of I- inhibited the catalatic activity of thyroid peroxidase and lactoperoxidase in a manner similar to that described previously for peroxidase-catalyzed iodination. On the basis of these observations and other findings, we have proposed a scheme which offers a possible explanation for iodide-dependent catalatic activity of thyroid peroxidase and lactoperoxidase. Compound I of the peroxidases is represented as EO, and oxidation of I- by EO is postulated to form enzyme-bound hypoiodite, represented in our scheme as [EOI]-. We suggest that the latter can react with H2O2 in a catalase-like reaction, with evolution of O2. We postulate further that the same form of oxidized iodine is also involved in iodination of tyrosine, oxidation of thioureylene drugs, and oxidation of I-, and that inhibition of catalatic activity by these agents occurs through competition with H2O2 for oxidized iodine.",

        "abstract": "This review reports on the pharmacodynamics of the new antipsychotic risperidone. The primary action of risperidone is serotonin 5-HT2 receptor blockade as shown by displacement of radioligand binding (Ki: 0.16 nM), activity on isolated tissues (EC50: 0.5 nM), and antagonism of peripherally (ED50: 0.0011 mg/kg) and centrally (ED50: 0.014 mg/kg) acting 5-HT2 receptor agonists in rats. Risperidone is at least as potent as the specific 5-HT2 receptor antagonist ritanserin in these tests. Risperidone is also a potent dopamine D2 receptor antagonist as indicated by displacement of radioligand binding (Ki: 1.4 nM), activity in isolated striatal slices (IC50: 0.89 nM), and antagonism of peripherally (ED50: 0.0057 mg/kg in dogs) and centrally acting D2 receptor agonists (ED50: 0.056-0.15 mg/kg in rats). Risperidone shows all effects common to D2 antagonists, including enhancement of prolactin release. However, some central effects such as catalepsy and blockade of motor activity occur at high doses only. Risperidone is 4-10 times less potent than haloperidol as a central D2 antagonist in rats and it differs from haloperidol by the following characteristics: predominant 5-HT2 antagonism; LSD antagonism; effects on sleep; smooth dose-response curves for D2 antagonism; synergism of combined 5-HT2/D2 antagonism; pronounced effects on amphetamine-induced oxygen consumption; increased social interaction; and pronounced effects on dopamine (DA) turnover. Risperidone displays similar activity at pre- and postsynaptic D2 receptors and at D2 receptors from various rat brain regions. The binding affinity for D4 and D3 receptors is 5 and 9 times weaker, respectively, than for D2 receptors; interaction with D1 receptors occurs only at very high concentrations. The pharmacological profile of risperidone includes interaction with histamine H1 and alpha-adrenergic receptors but the compound is devoid of significant interaction with cholinergic and a variety of other types of receptors. Risperidone has excellent oral activity, a rapid onset, and a 24-h duration of action. Its major metabolite, 9-hydroxyrisperidone, closely mimics risperidone in pharmacodynamics. Risperidone can be characterized as a potent D2 antagonist with predominant 5HT2 antagonistic activity and optimal pharmacokinetic properties.",

The emetogenicity of the chemotherapeutic agents, repeated chemotherapy cycles and patient risk factors (female gender, younger age, alcohol consumption, history of motion sickness) are the major risk factors for CINV. The use of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)3 receptor antagonists plus dexamethasone has significantly improved the control of acute CINV, but delayed nausea and vomiting remains a clinical problem. A new agent, palonosetron, has recently been approved for the prevention of acute CINV in patients receiving either moderately or highly emetogenic chemotherapy and for the prevention of delayed CINV in patients receiving moderately emetogenic chemotherapy. Palonosetron is a 5-HT3 receptor antagonist with a longer half-life and a higher binding affinity than first-generation 5-HT3 receptor antagonists. In a single dosing study, palonosetron was highly effective in controlling CINV compared with a single dose of dolasetron or ondansetron in patients receiving moderately emetogenic chemotherapy. Palonosetron in combination with dexamethasone demonstrated control of CINV in patients receiving highly emetogenic chemotherapy. Palonosetron appeared to be as effective in subsequent courses of chemotherapy compared with the initial course of chemotherapy. There were no clinically relevant differences seen among palonosetron, ondansetron or dolasetron in laboratory, electrocardiographic or vital-sign changes, and adverse reactions reported in the clinical trials were the most common reactions reported for the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist class. Recent studies using palonosetron-based anti-emetic combinations in moderately and highly emetogenic chemotherapy, as well as in the clinical setting of multiple-day chemotherapy, have been reported. Future studies may consider the use of palonosetron with current and other new agents and in other clinical settings, such as bone marrow transplantation and radiation therapy.",

The pharmacological characteristics and the anatomical location of dopamine D2-like receptor sites in rat heart and coronary vessels were investigated using combined binding techniques and light microscopy autoradiography. 2. Samples of heart and coronary vessels were harvested from young and old rats. On frozen slices, dopaminergic D2 receptors were labelled by means of a selective D2 ligand, namely [3H]-spiroperidol (spiperone). Inhibition studies were performed using unlabelled agonists and/or labelled and unlabelled antagonists to define pharmacological specificity of the binding. Physiological experiments were performed to demonstrate the selective antagonism between D2 receptors and many dopaminergic drugs. 3. [3H]-Spiroperidol was bound to sections of rat heart and coronary artery (in a manner consistent with the labelling of dopamine D2-like receptors) with an equilibrium dissociation constant of approximately 2.4 +/- 0.7 nmol/L and a maximum capacity of binding sites of 65.8 +/- 4.5 fmol/mg protein. Experiments performed on sections of coronary veins did not allow the evaluation of specific binding. Autoradiography, observed with light microscopy, showed the development of specific silver grains within the whole wall of rat heart and coronary artery. The greater sensitivity to displacement by amisulpride, bromocriptine, domperidone, haloperidol, raclopride and L-sulpiride than to displacement by N-propyl-norapomorphine, quinpirole and clozapine suggests that the binding sites observed in these experiments are likely to belong to the dopamine D2 receptor subtype. 4. Comparing results in young and old rats, we observed numerous significant age-related changes, including a decrease in D2 receptors localized in rat heart and coronary artery wall. These D2 receptors show a specific location, in close relationship with dopaminergic nerve fibres. They decrease with age and their role remains unknown.",

        "abstract": "The effects of anesthetic and convulsant barbiturates on brain N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor function were examined in a cell-free membrane vesicle preparation from mouse hippocampus. Increases in intracellular free calcium concentrations (Cai) were determined using a fluorescent dye, Indo-1, after stimulation with the NMDA receptor agonist, L-glutamate. Anesthetic barbiturates inhibited NMDA responses in a concentration-dependent manner with a rank order of potency of secobarbital &gt; amobarbital &gt; pentobarbital &gt; mephobarbital = phenobarbital &gt;&gt; barbital. However, the IC50 values for these barbiturates were larger than probable blood anesthetic concentrations. Barbiturates with both anesthetic and convulsant effects in mice [optical isomers of pentobarbital and secobarbital, 5-(2-cyclohexylideneethyl)-5-ethylbarbituric acid and (+/-)-dimethylbutylbarbituric acid] also reduced NMDA responses. Inhibition of NMDA responses by racemic pentobarbital or isomers of pentobarbital was noncompetitive. Resting Cai was altered by all barbiturates tested except secobarbital and barbital, but not in a consistent manner, suggesting that the effect of barbiturates on resting Cai is not related either to their effects on NMDA receptor responses or to their behavioral effects. These results show that anesthetic and convulsant barbiturates inhibit NMDA responses, but their anesthetic and convulsant activities may be primarily due to their effects on other brain targets.",

Each drug was injected to adult male Wistar rats intraperitoneally, each at a single dose and for 14 consecutive days. Thirty minutes after single or last injection of the examined drugs, the following behavioral parameters were recorded: yawning, oral activity, locomotion, exploratory activity, catalepsy and coordination ability. By HPLC/ED methods, we determined the effects of the examined antagonists on the levels of biogenic amines in striatum and hippocampus: dopamine (DA), 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC), homovanillic acid (HVA), 3-methoxytyramine (3-MT), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) and noradrenaline (NA). Additionally, DA and 5-HT synthesis rate was determined in striatum and 5-HT in hippocampus. The results of the study indicate that nafadotride, the dopamine D3 receptor antagonist, has a behavioral and biochemical profile of action different from that of haloperidol but partially similar to that of clozapine.",

Treatment of various preadipocyte cell lines with micromolar concentrations of indomethacin in the presence of insulin promotes their terminal differentiation. However, the molecular basis for the adipogenic actions of indomethacin had remained unclear. In this report, we show that indomethacin binds and activates peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma), a ligand-activated transcription factor known to play a pivotal role in adipogenesis. The concentration of indomethacin required to activate PPARgamma is in good agreement with that required to induce the differentiation of C3H10T1/2 cells to adipocytes. We demonstrate that several other NSAIDs, including fenoprofen, ibuprofen, and flufenamic acid, are also PPARgamma ligands and induce adipocyte differentiation of C3H10T1/2 cells. Finally, we show that the same NSAIDs that activate PPARgamma are also efficacious activators of PPARalpha, a liver-enriched PPAR subtype that plays a key role in peroxisome proliferation. Interestingly, several NSAIDs have been reported to induce peroxisomal activity in hepatocytes both in vitro and in vivo. Our findings define a novel group of PPARgamma ligands and provide a molecular basis for the biological effects of these drugs on adipogenesis and peroxisome activity.",

Nevertheless, signal transduction amplification might result in these compounds behaving as dopamine D(2) receptor full agonists at a more downstream level of signalling. We compared the intrinsic activity (E(max), expressed as a percentage of the maximal effect of dopamine) of aripiprazole, (+)terguride, OPC-4392 and (-)3-PPP using second (calcium (Ca(2+)) mobilization) and third (extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2) phosphoprotein expression) messenger readouts of cloned human dopamine D(2long) (hD(2L)) receptor signalling in CHO cells. These compounds were all less potent and displayed lower intrinsic activity in the Ca(2+) assay (aripiprazole = 24.3%, (+)terguride = 56.9%, OPC-4392 = 58.6% and (-)3-PPP = 75.1%), and aripiprazole (E(max) = 54.5%) displayed a substantially lower intrinsic activity than (+)terguride (E(max) = 92.3%), OPC-4392 (E(max) = 93.1%) and (-)3-PPP (E(max) = 101.1%) in the more downstream-based ERK2 phosphoprotein expression assay. These drug effects on Ca(2+) mobilization and ERK2 phosphoprotein expression were mediated through dopamine hD(2L) receptors, as they all were blocked by (-)raclopride, whereas (-)raclopride and other dopamine D(2) receptor antagonists (haloperidol, risperidone, ziprasidone, olanzapine, clozapine and quetiapine) were inactive on their own in both assays. These data are consistent with clinical evidence that only dopamine D(2) receptor partial agonists with a sufficiently low enough intrinsic activity will prove effective against the positive symptoms of schizophrenia, and also highlight the importance of using downstream-based assays in the discovery of novel D(2) receptor partial agonist therapeutics.",

The ability of olanzapine to activate or antagonize a number of neuronal receptors was investigated in vitro, in cell lines transfected selectively with receptor subtypes and in receptor-selective isolated tissue studies. Olanzapine had no agonist activity at any of the receptors examined. However, olanzapine was a potent antagonist of 5-HT-stimulated increases in IP3 in cell lines transfected with 5-HT2A or 5-HT2B receptors with IC50 values of 30-40 nM. Olanzapine weakly blocked 5-HT-induced formation of IP3 in cell lines transfected with 5-HT2c receptors, but in this cell line potently inhibited 5-HT-stimulated [35S]GTP gamma S binding with a Ki value of 15 nM. Olanzapine blocked dopamine-stimulated adenylyl cyclase in rat retina with modest potency (Ki = 69 nM), consistent with its relatively low affinity for dopamine D1 receptors. Olanzapine blocked agonist-induced activities at the muscarinic receptor subtypes M1, M2, M3, and M5 with Ki values of 70, 622, 126, and 82 nM, respectively. In studies using cell lines transfected with muscarinic M4 receptors, olanzapine and the atypical antipsychotic clozapine did not have agonist activities as determined with cAMP inhibition and stimulation assays, arachidonic acid release and [35S]GTP gamma S binding assays. However, olanzapine antagonized agonist-induced effects in muscarinic M4 cells with a Ki value of 350 nM. In isolated tissue studies, olanzapine potently blocked agonist-induced effects at alpha 1-adrenergic and histamine H1 receptors (KB = 9 and 19 nM, respectively). Thus, olanzapine was an antagonist at all receptors investigated and was a particularly potent antagonist at 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT2C, alpha 1-adrenergic and histamine H1 receptors. Olanzapine was a weaker antagonist at muscarinic and dopamine D1 receptors.",

        "title": "Cerivastatin, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase, inhibits the signaling pathways involved in the invasiveness and metastatic properties of highly invasive breast cancer cell lines: an in vitro study.",
        "abstract": "Cerivastatin is used in the treatment of hypercholesterolemia to inhibit 3-hydroxy 3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase and thus prevent the synthesis of cholesterol precursors, such as farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP), responsible, respectively, for translocation of Ras and Rho to the cell membrane, a step required for their cell signaling, leading to cell proliferation and migration. Recently, it has been suggested that non lipid-related effects of statins could play a beneficial role in cancer therapy. In this study, we have investigated the mechanisms by which statins inhibit cancer and the types of cancers which could benefit from this therapy. In MDA-MB-231 cells, an aggressive breast cancer cell line with spontaneous activation of Ras and NFkappaB and overexpression of RhoA, cerivastatin induced inhibition of both cell proliferation and invasion through Matrigel. This anti-proliferative effect was related to G(1)/S arrest due to an increase in p21(Waf1/Cip1). The anti-invasive effect was observed from 18 h and could be explained by RhoA delocalization from the cell membrane, resulting in disorganization of the actin fibers and disappearance of focal adhesion sites. The importance of RhoA inactivation in both these inhibitory effects was proved by their reversion by GGPP but not by FPP. Moreover, cerivastatin was also shown to induce inactivation of NFkappaB, in a RhoA inhibition-dependent manner, resulting in a decrease in urokinase and metalloproteinase-9 expression, two proteases involved in cell migration. The participation of Ras inactivation is considered a subsidiary mechanism for the effects of cerivastatin, as they were not rescued by FPP. Prolonged treatment of MDA-MB-231 cells with high doses of cerivastatin induced a loss of cell attachment. Interestingly, the effect of cerivastatin was considerably lower on poorly invasive MCF-7 cells. In conclusion, our results suggest that cerivastatin inhibits cell signaling pathways involved in the invasiveness and metastatic properties of highly invasive cancers.",

        "abstract": "Clinical improvements in Parkinson's disease produced by dopamine D3 receptor-preferring agonists have been related to their neuroprotective actions and, more recently, to their neuroregenerative properties. However, it is unclear whether dopamine agonists produce their neurotrophic effects by acting directly on receptors expressed by the mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons or indirectly on receptors expressed by astrocytes, via release of neurotrophic factors. In this study, we investigated the effects of the dopamine D3 receptor-preferring agonists quinpirole and 7-hydroxy-N,N-di-propyl-2-aminotetralin (7-OH-DPAT), as well as of the indirect agonist amphetamine, on dopaminergic neurons identified by tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity (TH-IR). Experiments were performed on neuronal-enriched primary cultures containing less than 0.5% of astrocytes prepared from the mouse embryo mesencephalon. After 3 days of incubation, both quinpirole (1-10 microm) and 7-OH-DPAT (5-500 nm) dose-dependently increased the maximal dendrite length (P &lt; 0.001), number of primary dendrites (P &lt; 0.01) and [3H]dopamine uptake (P &lt; 0.01) of TH-IR-positive mesencephalic neurons. Similar effects were observed with 10 microm amphetamine. All neurotrophic effects were blocked by the unselective D2/D3 receptor antagonist sulpiride (5 microm) and by the selective D3 receptor antagonist SB-277011-A at a low dose (50 nm). Quinpirole and 7-OH-DPAT also increased the phosphorylation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) within minutes, an effect blocked by pretreatment with SB-277011-A. Inhibition of the D2/D3 receptor signalling pathway to ERK was obtained with PD98059, GF109203 or LY294002, resulting in blockade of neurotrophic effects. These data suggest that dopamine agonists increase dendritic arborizations of mesencephalic dopaminergic neurons via a direct effect on D2/D3 receptors, preferentially involving D3 receptor-dependent neurotransmission.",

DATA SOURCE: A MEDLINE database search (1966-December 1999) was performed to identify relevant English-language articles including recent studies, abstracts, and reviews. Search terms included entacapone, OR-611, catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitor, and Parkinson's disease. STUDY SELECTION: Relevant published human studies were chosen to summarize the pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, adverse effects, and drug interactions. DATA EXTRACTION: All available human clinical trials were reviewed. DATA SYNTHESIS: Entacapone is the second medication of a new class of drugs, the catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitors, indicated for clinical use as an adjunct to levodopa/carbidopa to treat patients with idiopathic Parkinson's disease who experience the signs and symptoms of end-of-dose wearing-off. Entacapone in combination with levodopa/dopa decarboxylase inhibitor has been shown to increase the AUC of levodopa, which leads to less fluctuation of levodopa plasma concentrations. Clinically, the duration of motor response to levodopa was prolonged as reflected by an increase in the mean on time. The addition of entacapone resulted in a decrease in the mean daily dosage of levodopa. The recommended dosage of entacapone is 200 mg administered orally with each dose of levodopa/carbidopa, up to a maximum of eight doses per day. Common adverse effects include dyskinesia, nausea, diarrhea, and urine discoloration. CONCLUSIONS: Entacapone should be considered as add-on treatment to levodopa/carbidopa in Parkinson's disease patients with end-of-dose wearing-off effect.",

        "abstract": "The blockade of Akt activation through the inhibition of 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1 (PDK-1) represents a major signaling mechanism whereby celecoxib mediates apoptosis. Celecoxib, however, is a weak PDK-1 inhibitor (IC(50), 48 microM), requiring at least 30 microM to exhibit discernable effects on the growth of tumor cells in vitro. Here, we report the structure-based optimization of celecoxib to develop PDK-1 inhibitors with greater potency in enzyme inhibition and growth inhibition. Kinetics of PDK-1 inhibition by celecoxib with respect to ATP suggest that celecoxib derivatives inhibit PDK-1 by competing with ATP for binding, a mechanism reminiscent to that of many kinase inhibitors. Structure-activity analysis together with molecular modeling was used to generate compounds that were tested for their potency in inhibiting PDK-1 kinase activity and in inducing apoptosis in PC-3 prostate cancer cells. Docking of potent compounds into the ATP-binding site of PDK-1 was performed for lead optimization, leading to two compounds, OSU-03012 and OSU-03013, with IC(50) values in PDK-1 inhibition and apoptosis induction in the low microM range. Exposure of PC-3 cells to these agents led to Akt dephosphorylation and inhibition of p70 S6 kinase activity. Moreover, overexpression of constitutively active forms of PDK-1 and Akt partially protected OSU-03012-induced apoptosis. Screening in a panel of 60 cell lines and more extensive testing in PC-3 cells indicated that the mean concentration for total growth inhibition was approximately 3 microM for both agents. Considering the conserved role of PDK-1/Akt signaling in promoting tumorigenesis, these celecoxib analogs are of translational relevance for cancer prevention and therapy.",

        "title": "Entacapone: a catechol-O-methyltransferase inhibitor for the adjunctive treatment of Parkinson's disease.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: When levodopa therapy is used in Parkinson's disease, degradation of the drug in the peripheral nervous system is associated with dyskinesias and motor fluctuations. Much of this degradation is produced by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT), an enzyme involved in the metabolism of catecholamines and catechol compounds. Inhibition of COMT activity prolongs the action of levodopa and reduces fluctuations in response. Entacapone is a selective inhibitor of COMT whose activity is primarily in the peripheral nervous system, with little effect in the central nervous system. OBJECTIVE: This paper reviews the pharmacologic properties and clinical usefulness of entacapone in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. METHODS: Recent studies, abstracts, and reviews published in the English-language literature were identified through searches of MEDLINE (1966-September 2000), International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-September 2000), and PharmaProjects (September 2000 version), and from the Web sites of Parkinson's disease conferences held from 1996 to September 2000. Relevant human studies provided further information on the pharmacologic properties and clinical usefulness of entacapone. RESULTS: Entacapone is rapidly absorbed, with a time to maximum concentration of approximately 1 hour. Its plasma elimination half-life is 0.4 to 0.7 hour in the beta phase and 2.4 hours in the gamma phase, and it has 35% absolute bioavailability after oral administration, secondary to first-pass clearance. Entacapone is 98% protein bound; thus, it is not distributed widely in tissues and is almost completely metabolized before excretion (0.1%-0.2% of dose unchanged in urine). The drug inhibits erythrocyte-soluble COMT activity in a dose-dependent fashion (48% after a 400-mg dose, 82% after an 800-mg dose). The inhibitory effect is reversible, with recovery of soluble COMT activity within 4 to 8 hours. In levodopa-treated patients with Parkinson's disease who experience motor fluctuations, clinical trials have demonstrated entacapone's effectiveness in increasing \"on\" time (the period during which medications relieve the symptoms of Parkinson's disease) by up to 1.2 hours, decreasing \"off\" time (the period during which symptoms increase) by 0.9 to 1.3 hours, and producing overall total improvement in scores on the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale. The recommended dosage of entacapone is 200 mg administered orally with each dose of levodopa/carbidopa, up to 8 doses per day. The drug is generally well tolerated, with most adverse effects attributed to levodopa-related dopaminergic effects, including dyskinesias and nausea. CONCLUSIONS: In clinical trials, adjuvant treatment with entacapone appeared to be an effective and well-tolerated therapeutic strategy in patients with Parkinson's disease who experience fluctuations in the response to levodopa therapy. The increased elimination half-life of levodopa with concomitant entacapone results in greater and more sustained plasma levodopa levels, with more constant dopaminergic stimulation in the brain and greater amelioration of parkinsonian symptoms.",

This agent, but not the H2R antagonists ranitidine and famotidine, induced the production of an antitumor cytokine, interleukin (IL)-18, by human monocytes and dendritic cells (DC). In fact, ranitidine and famotidine antagonized cimetidine-induced IL-18 production. Cimetidine induced the activation of caspase-1, which is reported to modify immature IL-18 to mature/active IL-18, and the elevation of intracellular cAMP, leading to the activation of protein kinase A (PKA). The PKA inhibitor H89 abolished the IL-18 production induced by cimetidine. Moreover, the effects of cimetidine on IL-18 production were reproduced in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from wild-type mice, but not in those from H2R knockout mice. In conclusion, cimetidine, a partial agonist for H2R, has a pharmacological profile different from ranitidine and famotidine, possibly contributing to its antitumor activity on gastrointestinal cancers.",

Four groups of amino acid (AA) mixtures, including the substrates of ALT (L-Glu and L-Ala), were effectively separated. Under the optimized conditions, the quantitative analysis of L-Glu and L-Ala was conducted and limits of detection (signal/noise=3) for L-Glu and L-Ala were 4.0 x 10-7 and 2.0 x 10-7 M, respectively. In the reaction catalyzed by ALT, enzyme kinetic constants were determined for both the forward and reverse reactions by monitoring the concentration decrease of substrate AAs (L-Ala and L-Glu), and the K(m) and V(max) values were 10.12 mM and 0.48 mM/min for forward reaction and 3.22 mM and 0.22 mM/min for reverse reaction, respectively.

        "abstract": "The vasopressin V2 receptor (V2R) belongs to the Class A G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). V2R is expressed in the renal collecting duct (CD), where it mediates the antidiuretic action of the neurohypophyseal hormone arginine vasopressin (CYFQNCPRG-NH2, AVP). Desmopressin ([1-deamino, 8-D]AVP, dDAVP) is strong selective V2R agonist with negligible pressor and uterotonic activity. In this paper, the interactions responsible for binding of dDAVP to vasopressin V2 receptor versus vasopressin V1a and oxytocin receptors has been examined. Three-dimensional activated models of the receptors were constructed using the multiple sequence alignment and the complex of activated rhodopsin with Gt(alpha) C-terminal peptide of transducin MII-Gt(alpha) (338-350) prototype (Slusarz, R.; Ciarkowski, J. Acta Biochim Pol 2004 51, 129-136) as a template. The 1-ns unconstrained molecular dynamics (MD) of receptor-dDAVP complexes immersed in the fully hydrated 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphatidylcholine (POPC) membrane model was conducted in an Amber 7.0 force field. Highly conserved transmembrane residues have been proposed as being responsible for V2R activation and G protein coupling. Molecular mechanism of the dDAVP binding has been suggested. The internal water molecules involved in an intricate network of the hydrogen bonds inside the receptor cavity have been identified and their role in the stabilization of the agonist-bound state proposed.",

        "abstract": "Two catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitors, entacapone and tolcapone, were compared in the rat to elucidate the actual differences between their pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics after single and repeated administration. Their inhibitory potencies were also compared in vitro. After intravenous administration (3 mg/kg), the elimination half-life (t(1/2 beta)) of entacapone (0.8 h) was clearly shorter than that of tolcapone (2.9 h). The striatum/serum ratio of tolcapone was 3-fold higher than that of entacapone. After a single oral dose (10 mg/kg), both entacapone and tolcapone produced an equal maximal degree of COMT inhibition in peripheral tissues, but tolcapone inhibited striatal COMT more effectively than did entacapone. After the 7-day treatment (10 mg/kg twice daily), COMT activity had recovered to a level of 67 to 101% of control within 8 h after the last dose of entacapone. In tolcapone-treated animals, there was still extensive COMT inhibition present in peripheral tissues, and the degree of inhibition was higher than that attained after a single dose. The pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling revealed that a plateau of COMT inhibition near the maximal attainable inhibition was reached already by plasma concentrations below 2000 ng/ml, both with entacapone and tolcapone. Entacapone and tolcapone inhibited equally rat liver COMT in vitro with K(i) values of 10.7 and 10.0 nM, respectively. In conclusion, tolcapone has a longer duration of action and a better brain penetration than entacapone. The results also suggest that peripheral COMT is inhibited continuously when tolcapone is dosed at 12-h intervals, but this was not seen with entacapone.",

        "abstract": "This review is an update on the literature accumulated over the past 10 years following the original observation that azelaic acid, a naturally occurring and nontoxic C9 dicarboxylic acid, possesses significant biologic properties and a potential as a therapeutic agent. These studies have shown that azelaic acid is a reversible inhibitor of tyrosinase and other oxidoreductases in vitro and that it inhibits mitochondrial respiration. It can also inhibit anaerobic glycolysis. Both in vitro and in vivo it has an antimicrobial effect on both aerobic and anaerobic (Propionibacterium acnes) microorganisms. In tissue culture it exerts a dose- and time-dependent cytotoxic effect on malignant melanocytes, associated with mitochondrial damage and inhibition of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) synthesis. Tumoral cell lines not containing tyrosinase are equally affected. Normal cells in culture exposed to the same concentrations of the diacid that are toxic for tumoral cells are in general not damaged. Radioactive azelaic acid has been shown to penetrate tumoral cells at a higher level than normal cells of the corresponding line. Topically applied (a 20% cream), it has been shown to be of therapeutic value in skin disorders of different etiologies. Its beneficial effect on various forms of acne (comedogenic, papulopustular, nodulocystic) has been clearly demonstrated. Particularly important is its action on abnormal melanocytes, which has led to the possibility of obtaining good results on melasma and highly durable therapeutic responses on lentigo maligna. It is also capable of causing regression of cutaneous malignant melanoma, but its role in melanoma therapy remains to be investigated.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

RESULTS: In the NMDA-injured brain, the CysLT1 receptor mRNA, and protein expression were upregulated, and the receptor was mainly localized in the neurons and not in the astrocytes. Pranlukast, ketamine and edaravone decreased NMDA-induced injury; pranlukast (0.1 mg/kg) and ketamine inhibited the upregulated expression of the CysLT1 receptor.

The molecular weight and phosphodiesterase activation of the lymphocyte calmodulin were very similar to those of purified bovine brain calmodulin. Trifluoperazine (TFP), a calmodulin inhibitor, suppressed lymphocyte stimulation as assessed by 3H-thymidine incorporation into DNA of lectin-stimulated lymphocytes. TFP had no effect on the early 45Ca2+ uptake induced by mitogenic lectins, although this latter was inhibited by verapamil which also suppressed the 3H-thymidine incorporation. The results are in keeping with the interpretation that the inhibition of T cell stimulation by TFP was not due to suppression of Ca2+ uptake, but due to inactivation of Ca(2+)-calmodulin complex which might be formed subsequent to Ca2+ entry into the cell.",

        "abstract": "The effects of nizatidine (a new H2-receptor antagonist) and of related compounds were studied on oxidative drug metabolism in the rat both in vivo and in vitro. Nizatidine is a structural analog of the H2-receptor antagonists ICI 125,211 (Tiotidine) and ranitidine (Zantac). Nizatidine (120 mg/kg, ip) had no effect on the [14C]aminopyrine (ABT) or [14C]caffeine breath (CBT) tests, nor on the clearance from plasma of aminopyrine despite high tissue and plasma concentrations of nizatidine. Binding of nizatidine (1 mM) to rat hepatic microsomal P-450 determined by spectral analysis was not observed. In vitro aminopyrine demethylation was inhibited by nizatidine only at high concentrations (Ki = 92 mM). Cimetidine, ICI 125,211, and imidazole bind avidly to rat hepatic microsomal cytochrome P-450 and are potent inhibitors of aminopyrine demethylation in vitro. Imidazole inhibited the aminopyrine breath test, while imidazole, ranitidine, and ICI 125,211 inhibited the caffeine breath in vivo. These data indicate that nizatidine has no acute inhibitory effect on hepatic oxidative drug metabolism in the rat, both in vitro and in vivo. The composite structural-activity data suggest that inhibition of in vivo oxidative drug metabolism by H2-antagonists may not depend primarily on either the imidazole ring side chain or the thiazole ring per se. Furthermore, the in vivo inhibition may not correlate with in vitro data.",

In this study, we showed that bisdioxopiperazines induced erythroid differentiation, inhibited human leukemia K562 cell growth, and caused a slow induction of apoptosis. Dexrazoxane treatment caused DNA endoreduplication resulting in large highly polyploid cells. This result suggested the lack of a DNA topoisomerase II activity-based cell cycle checkpoint. The percentage of K562 cells that became apoptotic was much larger than the percentage of cells that stained for hemoglobin, suggesting that prior differentiation was not required for induction of apoptosis. Use of the Bcr-Abl tyrosine kinase inhibitor STI-571 resulted in a reduction in Bcl-xL levels and potentiation of dexrazoxane-induced apoptosis related to an earlier onset and more extensive cleavage of caspase-3. These results indicated that dexrazoxane-induced apoptosis is associated with a caspase-3 activation/cleavage pathway. In addition, these results were consistent with the antiapoptotic signaling function of Bcr-Abl to regulate expression of Bcl-xL. The ability of dexrazoxane to induce differentiation and apoptosis suggests that bisdioxopiperazines may be useful in treating some types of leukemia.",

        "abstract": "In order to satisfy government mandates, numerous studies have been performed categorizing potential endocrine disrupting chemicals as (anti)estrogens or (anti)androgens. We report here that dihydrotestosterone (DHT), a potent, non-aromatizable androgen receptor agonist, induces antiestrogenic responses through direct and/or indirect modulation of vitellogenin (Vg), steroid hormone and total cytochrome P450 levels. DHT and two weak, aromatizable androgens, DHEA and androstenedione (0.05-50 mg/kg per day), were fed to juvenile trout for 2 weeks. DHEA and androstenedione significantly increased blood plasma Vg by up to 30- and 45-fold, respectively (P&lt;0.05, t-test). 17beta-Estradiol (E2) increases were also observed with both androgens, albeit with lower sensitivity. DHT markedly decreased Vg and E2 levels, suggesting that DHEA and androstenedione increased Vg and E2 via conversion to E2 and not by estrogen receptor agonism. DHEA and androstenedione had no effect on total cytochrome P450 content, while DHT significantly decreased P450 content in a dose dependent fashion. These results indicate that alterations in metabolism mediated by androgen receptor binding may be responsible for the Vg and E2 decreases by DHT. In an attempt to decipher between receptor and non-receptor androgenic mechanisms of the observed DHT effects, DHT (0, 50 or 100 mg/kg per day) and flutamide (0-1250 mg/kg per day), an androgen receptor antagonist, were fed to juvenile rainbow trout for 2 weeks. Flutamide alone was as effective as DHT in decreasing E2 and Vg levels in males but did not significantly reverse DHT induced Vg decreases in either sex (P&gt;0.05, F-test). DHT decreases in total P450 content were partially attenuated in males by flutamide co-treatment, but not females, suggesting a partial androgenic mechanism to the P450 decreases as well as a fundamental sex difference responding to androgen receptor binding. Moreover, flutamide alone decreased P450 content by up to 30% in males and 40% in females. These effects may be mediated through direct androgen receptor binding irrespective of whether the binding is agonistic or antagonistic. This study indicates that androgen receptor agonists/antagonists can elicit significant antiestrogenic effects that may not necessarily be mediated through classic receptor binding mechanisms and signal transduction pathways.",

However, it is not clear which carbonic anhydrase isozymes might be responsible for the anticonvulsant activity of such sulfonamide/sulfamate drugs. We examine here the full inhibition profile against all mammalian carbonic anhydrases of the above antiepileptic drugs together with two investigational, structurally related sulfonamides, one of which is and the other is not an anticonvulsant. No clear-cut data allow us to propose which are the carbonic anhydrases involved in these processes, but strong carbonic anhydrase II, VII, IX, and XII inhibition, correlated with sufficiently high liposolubility may lead to effective anticonvulsants of this pharmacological class. Therefore, further studies are warranted for better understanding these phenomena. Whether the inhibition of such carbonic anhydrases present in the mammalian brain might be relevant for designing pharmacological agents useful in the management of neurological disorders or for understanding the multifactorial mechanism of action of some of these drugs is a topic which surely deserves further investigations.",

        "abstract": "By optimizing binding to a selected target protein, modern drug research strives to develop safe and efficacious agents for the treatment of disease. Selective drug action is intended to minimize undesirable side effects from scatter pharmacology. Celecoxib (Celebrex), valdecoxib (Bextra), and rofecoxib (Vioxx) are nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) due to selective inhibition of inducible cyclooxygenase COX-2 while sparing inhibition of constitutive COX-1. While rofecoxib contains a methyl sulfone constituent, celecoxib and valdecoxib possess an unsubstituted arylsulfonamide moiety. The latter group is common to many carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitors. Using enzyme kinetics and X-ray crystallography, we demonstrate an unexpected nanomolar affinity of the COX-2 specific arylsulfonamide-type celecoxib and valdecoxib for isoenzymes of the totally unrelated carbonic anhydrase (CA) family, such as CA I, II, IV, and IX, whereas the rofecoxib methyl sulfone-type has no effect. When administered orally to glaucomatous rabbits, celecoxib and valdecoxib lowered intraocular pressure, suggesting that these agents may have utility in the treatment of this disorder. The crystal structure of celecoxib in complex with CA II reveals part of this inhibition to be mediated via binding of the sulfonamide group to the catalytic zinc of CA II. To investigate the structural basis for cross-reactivity of these compounds between COX-2 and CA II, we compared the molecular recognition properties of both protein binding pockets in terms of local physicochemical similarities among binding site-exposed amino acids accommodating different portions of the drug molecules. Our approach Cavbase, implemented into Relibase, detects similarities between the sites, suggesting some potential to predict unexpected cross-reactivity of drugs among functionally unrelated target proteins. The observed cross-reactivity with CAs may also contribute to differences in the pharmacological profiles, in particular with respect to glaucoma and anticancer therapy and may suggest new opportunities of these COX-2 selective NSAIDs.",

This preparation was studied to determine its mode of interaction with monoamine oxidase using purified rat brain mitochondrial monoamine oxidase as the enzyme source. Reaction velocities were determined spectrophotometrically by quantitating the rate of appearance of 4-hydroxyquinoline from kynuramine. Dilutional studies comparing the mechanism of inhibition of monoamine oxidase produced by Gerovital H3 and by ipronizid demonstrated that Gerovital H3 was a reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase. Analysis of studies using Lineweaver-Burk and Dixon plots revealed that Gerovital H3 was a fully competitive inhibitor of monoamine oxidase. That Gerovital H3 is a weak, reversible, competitive inhibitor of monoamine oxidase may explain the absence of adverse reactions associated with the clinical use of Gerovital H3 as compared to the severe adverse reactions that have been associated with the use of irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitors.",

        "abstract": "2'-Chloropentostatin is a new inhibitor of adenosine deaminase isolated from the fermentation broth of an unidentified actinomycete, ATCC 39365. It contains the aglycone of coformycin, i.e. 3,6,7,8-tetrahydroimidazo[4,5-d][1,3]diazepin-8-o1, coupled to the unusual carbohydrate, 2'-chloro-2'-deoxyribose. 2'-Chloropentostatin is a slightly weaker inhibitor of rat and human adenosine deaminases than coformycin, and considerably weaker than pentostatin. Unlike pentostatin, which appears to undergo a two-stage interaction with adenosine deaminase, 2'-chloropentostatin forms a single enzyme-inhibitor complex. The enzyme-inhibitor complex between adenosine deaminase and 2'-chloropentostatin was much more rapidly dissociable than the complex with pentostatin. The complex between adenosine deaminase and 2'-chloropentostatin dissociated with a half-life of approximately 3 hr, compared with 68 hr for the complex between adenosine deaminase and pentostatin. 2'-Chloropentostatin, at concentrations up to 10 micromolar, did not cause significant inhibition of growth of WI-L2 human B-cell lymphoblasts, or of CCRF-CEM human T-cell lymphoblasts in culture. However, it greatly potentiated the inhibitory potency of adenosine, 2'-deoxyadenosine, or arabinosyladenine towards these cell lines. This potentiating effect was equipotent for 2'-chloropentostatin and pentostatin. T-cells (CCRF-CEM) were much more sensitive to the inhibitory effect of combinations of adenosine or 2'-deoxyadenosine with 2'-chloropentostatin or pentostatin than were B-cells (WI-L2). Pentostatin and 2'-chloropentostatin had no significant antitumor activity against mouse leukemia L1210 in vivo. However, these adenosine deaminase inhibitors, at nontoxic doses, greatly potentiated the antitumor activity of ara-A 5'-phosphate. 2'-Chloropentostatin was somewhat more active in this regard than was pentostatin.",

Treatment of 2- to 3-day-old human hepatocyte cultures with 3 x 10(-5) M lovastatin, simvastatin, fluvastatin, or atorvastatin for 24 h increased the amounts of CYP2B6 and CYP3A mRNA by an average of 3.8- to 9.2-fold and 24- to 36-fold, respectively. In contrast, pravastatin treatment had no effect on the mRNA level of either CYP2B6 or CYP3A, although treatment with pravastatin did produce the expected compensatory increase in HMG-CoA reductase mRNA content, indicating effective inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis. Although treatment with the active (+), but not the inactive (-), enantiomer of atorvastatin increased the amount of HMG-CoA reductase mRNA, treatment with each enantiomer significantly induced both CYP2B6 and CYP3A mRNA levels. Treatment of primary cultured rat hepatocytes with the atorvastatin enantiomers effectively increased the amount of CYP3A mRNA, but had no effect on CYP2B or CYP4A mRNA levels, in contrast to fluvastatin, which increased both. Findings for p450 proteins by Western blotting were consistent with the mRNA results. These findings indicate that the ability of a drug to inhibit HMG-CoA reductase activity does not predict its ability to produce p450 induction in primary cultured human hepatocytes, and demonstrate that some, but not all, of the effects of these drugs that occur in primary cultured rat hepatocytes are conserved in human hepatocyte cultures.",

        "title": "Preclinical in vitro cardiac electrophysiology: a method of predicting arrhythmogenic potential of antihistamines in humans?",
        "abstract": "The cardiac action potential results from a dynamic balance between inward depolarising Na+ and Ca2+ currents and outward K+ repolarising currents. During a cardiac cycle, the resultant of repolarisation phase from all ventricular cells is represented by the QT interval of the surface ECG. Congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) is characterised by polymorphic ventricular tachycardia sometimes with twisting QRS morphology (torsade de pointes) which, although usually self-limiting, can result in sudden cardiac death. Acquired LQTS can be induced by a variety of drugs, including some nonsedative histamine H1 receptor antagonists (astemizole, terfenadine). The Committee for Proprietary Medicinal Products of the European Union has recently proposed studying the action potential in in vitro heart preparations as a preclinical test for predicting the propensity of noncardiovascular drugs to induce malignant QT prolongation in humans. The effects of several histamine H1 receptor antagonists on the electrically evoked action potential have been evaluated in rabbit Purkinje fibres. In this preparation, astemizole (0.3 to 10 micromol/L) prolongs the duration of the action potential measured at the level where repolarisation is 90% complete (APD90). This effect is dependent on drug concentration, incubation time, pacing frequency and K+ or Mg2+ concentration. Astemizole also markedly depresses the rate of rise of the action potential (Vmax). Terfenadine showed qualitatively similar, but quantitatively smaller, effects in this model. The histamine H1 receptor antagonists cetirizine, ebastine, carebastine, loratadine and fexofenadine do not significantly affect APD90 at 1 micromol/L, but cetirizine and carebastine prolong it slightly at 10 micromol/L. In conclusion, in rabbit Purkinje fibres, astemizole and terfenadine produce adverse electrophysiological effects at concentrations which may be achieved in the human myocardium in certain clinical situations. APD90 lengthening induced by carebastine and cetirizine is minor and occurs at concentrations that are very unlikely to be encountered clinically, since these drugs, in contrast to astemizole and terfenadine, do not accumulate in the myocardium. Direct extrapolation of preclinical results to humans requires great caution, since malignant QT prolongations by terfenadine and astemizole are extremely rare clinical events. However, since prolongation of the QT interval often precedes the development of torsade de pointes, any significant delay in cardiac repolarisation produced by noncardiovascular drugs in preclinical, and particularly in clinical, studies should, in general, be considered to indicate a potential cardiac risk in humans. Its significance should subsequently be evaluated in appropriate studies in patients with conditions known to predispose to arrhythmias.",

        "title": "Drospirenone, a progestogen with antimineralocorticoid properties: a short review.",
        "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Progesterone (P) has high affinity to the mineralocorticoid receptor (MCR), and it is an MCR antagonist. Almost all synthetic progestogens are devoid of this antimineralocorticoid (anti-MC) effect. They are unable to antagonize the salt retaining effect of estrogens. This could be one cause of weight gain and an increase in blood pressure with the use of combined oral contraceptives (OC) and, in some susceptible women, with postmenopausal estrogen/(progestogen) treatment. The purpose of this presentation is to review results of clinical studies with drospirenone (DRSP), a new progestogen developed by Schering A.G., with anti-MCR activity. DRSP is a derivative of 17-alpha-spirolactone. In rats, rabbits and in man, it is a PR-agonist and an MCR- and androgen-R antagonist with no effect on the glucocorticoid-R and the estrogen-R. In normally menstruating women, 2-3mg DRSP per day, taken from day 5 to 25 of the cycle, inhibit ovulation, lead to a mild natriuresis, and a slight compensatory activation of the renin-aldosterone system. Compared with an OC containing 30 microg ethinylestradiol (EE) and 150 microg levonorgestrel, a combination of 3mg DRSP with 30 microg EE given over 6 months led to a slight decrease in body weight and blood pressure. The reduction in mean body weight by a combination of DRSP with EE compared with a conventional OC could be confirmed in a study over 26 months in 900 young women. The OC containing DRSP has favorable effects in patients suffering from the premenstrual syndrome (PMS), and, partly due to the antiandrogenic effect of DRSP, in those with acne vulgaris. For postmenopausal women, a combination of DRSP with estradiol has been developed with the expectation that the slight blood pressure lowering and weight reducing effects will minimize cardiovascular morbidity in patients needing hormone treatment because of hot flushes and other climacteric symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: DRSP, by its anti-MCR effect and its potential to slightly decrease body weight and blood pressure, shares many pharmacodynamic properties with progesterone, and it is a candidate for reducing cardiovascular morbidity in women using OCs or postmenopausal hormone treatment.",

        "abstract": "We characterized the pharmacological profiles of the human mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid receptor for 11 natural and synthetic steroids regarding binding pharmacology, intracellular localization of hormone-receptor complexes, and agonistic or antagonistic properties at the gene expression level. The sex steroid progesterone bound with an affinity (ki &lt; 0.01 nM) even higher than that of aldosterone to the human mineralocorticoid receptor and effectively antagonized the effect of aldosterone via the human mineralocorticoid receptor in functional co-transfection assays. This indicates that progesterone has potent antimineralocorticoid properties, while its antiglucocorticoid effects were less pronounced. The partial agonistic activities of antihormones in this assay suggest a direct interaction of antihormone-receptor complexes with the response elements on the DNA. These results are supported by immunofluorescence studies, in which both unliganded human mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid receptors were distributed throughout the cytoplasm and nucleus, whereas agonist- as well as antagonist-receptor complexes showed an exclusively nuclear localization. These results contribute to the understanding of antihormone pharmacology and increase our understanding of the role of human mineralocorticoid and glucocorticoid receptors in physiological processes during different endocrine states.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Both isoforms of cyclo-oxygenase, COX-1 and COX-2, are inhibited to varying degrees by all of the available nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). Because inhibition of COX-1 by NSAIDs is linked to gastrointestinal ulcer formation, those drugs that selectively inhibit COX-2 may have less gastrointestinal toxicity. We measured the extent to which NSAIDs and other anti-inflammatory or analgesic drugs inhibit COX-1 and COX-2 in humans. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Aliquots of whole blood from 16 healthy volunteers were incubated ex vivo with 25 antiinflammatory or analgesic drugs at six concentrations ranging from 0 (control) to 100 microM (n = 5 for each). Blood was assayed for serum-generated thromboxane B2 synthesis (COX-1 assay) and for lipopolysaccharide-stimulated prostaglandin E2 synthesis (COX-2 assay). In addition, gastric biopsies from the same volunteers were incubated with each drug ex vivo and mucosal prostaglandin E2 synthesis measured. RESULTS: Inhibitory potency and selectivity of NSAIDs for COX-1 and COX-2 activity in blood varied greatly. Some NSAIDs (eg, flurbiprofen, ketoprofen) were COX-1 selective, some (eg, ibuprofen, naproxen) were essentially nonselective, while others (eg, diclofenac, mefenamic acid) were COX-2 selective. Inhibitory effects of NSAIDs on gastric prostaglandin E2 synthesis correlated with COX-1 inhibitory potency in blood (P &lt; 0.001) and with COX-1 selectivity (P &lt; 0.01), but not with COX-2 inhibitory potency. Even COX-2 \"selective\" NSAIDs still had sufficient COX-1 activity to cause potent inhibitory effects on gastric prostaglandin E2 synthesis at concentrations achieved in vivo. CONCLUSION: No currently marketed NSAID, even those that are COX-2 selective, spare gastric COX activity at therapeutic concentrations. Thus, all NSAIDs should be used cautiously until safer agents are developed.",

This study therefore examined the motor effects of lamotrigine in naive and reserpine-treated mice and its interactions with dopaminergic agonists. In normal mice, lamotrigine (5-80 mg/kg i.p.) decreased spontaneous locomotor activity with high doses (&gt; or = 40 mg/kg) causing moderately severe impairment to posture and gait. In mice treated 24 h beforehand with reserpine (5 mg/kg i.p.), lamotrigine (5-40 mg/kg i.p.) had no effect on akinesia by itself and did not alter the locomotion induced with the selective dopamine D1 receptor agonist 2,3,4, 5-tetrahydro-7,8-dihydroxy-1-phenyl-1 H-3-benzazepine hydrochloride (SKF 38393, 30 mg/kg i.p.). By contrast, motor responses to the dopamine D2 receptor-selective agonist N-n-propyl-N-phenylethyl-p-(3-hydroxyphenyl)ethylamine (RU 24213, 5 mg/kg s.c.) and to the dopamine precursor L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (L-DOPA, 150 mg/kg i.p. in the presence of benserazide, 100 mg/kg i.p.), were significantly potentiated by 10 and 40 mg/kg i.p. lamotrigine respectively. It is suggested that lamotrigine may enhance the antiakinetic action of L-DOPA in parkinson-like mice by increasing motor responding mediated by dopamine D2 but not dopamine D1 receptors. This interaction profile of lamotrigine with dopamine D1 and D2 receptor mechanisms is opposite to what one sees with antagonists of glutamate receptors.",

        "abstract": "In previous studies, we have demonstrated that stimulation of alpha 1 but not alpha 2 or beta adrenergic receptors in rat embryos grown in culture interferes with normal development of the left/right body axis leading to situs inversus. In the present study, we aimed to determine the alpha 1 adrenergic receptor subtype and signal transduction pathway involved in this phenomenon. Rat embryos at Stage 11a by a modified Theiler's staging system were cultured for 50 hr in medium containing various compounds which are known to activate or inhibit different sites of the signal transduction pathways associated with alpha 1 adrenergic receptors. They were then examined to determine the sidedness of asymmetric body structures. WB4101, a selective antagonist of alpha 1A adrenergic receptor subtype, but not chlorethylclonidine, a selective antagonist of alpha 1B adrenergic receptor subtype, inhibited phenylephrine (an alpha 1 adrenergic agonist)-induced situs inversus. Neither the protein kinase C (PKC) activators phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate and SC-9 nor the PKC inhibitor calphostin C caused situs inversus. Furthermore, calphostin C did not block phenylephrine-induced situs inversus. A23187, a Ca2+ ionophore, induced situs inversus; nifedipine, a L-type Ca2+ channel blocker, partially blocked phenylephrine-induced situs inversus. The calmodulin antagonists trifluoperazine, W-7, and W-13 blocked phenylephrine-induced situs inversus, although they did not cause situs inversus by themselves. KN-62, a Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaM kinase II) inhibitor, dose-dependently blocked phenylephrine-induced situs inversus. However, higher concentrations of this compound produced no block in the presence of phenylephrine and in its absence produced a 50% incidence of situs inversus. These results indicate that alpha 1 adrenergic stimulation-induced situs inversus is mediated by the alpha 1A adrenergic receptor subtype and that activation of CaM kinase II but not PKC may be involved.",

        "abstract": "Donepezil is a reversible and noncompetitive cholinesterase inhibitor. The drug is considered as a first-line treatment in patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. Recently, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective effects of the drug have been reported. \"Cholinergic anti-inflammation pathway\" has major implications in these effects. Here, we present evidence that donepezil at 5-20 microM directly acts on microglial cells to inhibit their inflammatory activation. Our conclusion is based on the measurement of nitric oxide and proinflammatory mediators using purified microglia cultures and microglia cell lines: donepezil attenuated microglial production of nitric oxide and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and suppressed the gene expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase, interleukin-1 beta, and TNF-alpha. Subsequent studies showed that donepezil inhibited a canonical inflammatory NF-kappaB signaling. Microglia/neuroblastoma coculture and animal experiments supported the anti-inflammatory effects of donepezil. Based on the studies using nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonists, the donepezil inhibition of microglial activation was independent of acetylcholine and its receptor. Thus, inflammatory activation signaling of microglia may be one of the direct targets of donepezil in the central nervous system. It should be noted, however, that there is a large gap between the therapeutic dose of the drug used clinically and the concentration of the drug that exerts the direct action on microglial cells.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: An acetylcholinesterase inhibitor donepezil currently is used to treat patients with Alzheimer disease. However, its direct effect on cerebral blood vessels has not been evaluated. The present study was designed to examine whether donepezil induces acute cerebral arteriolar dilation and whether neuronal nitric oxide synthase contributes to this vasodilator response. METHODS: Brain slices were obtained from neuronal nitric oxide synthase knock-out or C57BL/6J strain (control) mice as well as Wistar rats. Parenchymal arterioles were monitored using videomicroscopy. During constriction to prostaglandin F2alpha (5 x 10 m), donepezil (10-10 m) or acetylcholine (10-10 m) was added. In some experiments, brain slices were treated with a nonselective or a selective nitric oxide synthase inhibitor (N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester [10 m] and S-methyl-L-thiocitrulline [10 m], respectively). An immunohistochemical analysis was performed using antibodies for neuronal nitric oxide synthase and acetylcholinesterase. RESULTS: Acetylcholine concentration-dependently dilated rat parenchymal arterioles, while S-methyl-L-thiocitrulline as well as N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester completely abolished this response. Donepezil produced arteriolar dilation, which was inhibited by S-methyl-L-thiocitrulline or N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester. Donepezil failed to induce arteriolar dilation in the brain slice from the neuronal nitric oxide synthase knock-out mice. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed spatial relationship between neuronal nitric oxide synthase and acetylcholinesterase in the arteriolar wall. CONCLUSIONS: Donepezil produces acute vasodilation induced by a selective activation of neuronal nitric oxide synthase in the cerebral parenchymal arterioles. This agent may be capable of enhancing this enzymatic activity directly or via acetylcholinesterase existing on the arteriolar wall.",

Isolated segments of guinea pig ileum were used in Tyrode solution at 37 degrees C. The maximum activity of ranitidine on the ileum was about 79% of the maximum activity of acetylcholine and about 90% of the maximum activity of physostigmine. The contractile responses induced by ranitidine were prevented by atropine and this prevention was stronger against physostigmine. Ranitidine produced an augmentation of the acetylcholine induced contractions which was less against physostigmine. The contractile responses induced by acetylcholine were prevented by acetylcholinesterase. This acetylcholinesterase activity was inhibited by ranitidine and this inhibition was weaker than that caused by physostigmine. These findings suggest that ranitidine exerts at least an anticholinesterase activity which is weaker against physostigmine.",

Mice were killed 24 h after the last injection. Dopamine D1 and dopamine D2 receptors were determined by receptor autoradiography, and dopamine D1 and dopamine D2 receptor mRNA and glutamic acid decarboxylase mRNA were determined by in situ hybridization histochemistry. The results showed that treatment with EEDQ, which blocked 80% to 85% of the dopamine D2 and dopamine D1 receptors in substantia nigra, increased the levels of dopamine D2 receptor mRNA in substantia nigra by about 27%. Treatment with fluphenazine-N-mustard, which blocked about 85% of the dopamine D2 receptors in substantia nigra but had no significant effect on dopamine D1 receptors, increased the levels of dopamine D2 receptor mRNA by about 34%.

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: In this paper we investigated the effect of indomethacin, acetazolamide and their combination in vitro and in vivo on carbonic anhydrase (CA) isozymes. METHOD: In vitro experiments followed the effect of the two substances at concentrations between 10(-8)-10(-4) M on purified human red cell CA I and II as well as on human gastric mucosa CA IV using dose-response relationships. Kinetic studies were also performed. The effects of single and combined administration of indomethacin and acetazolamide on red cell CA and on gastric acid secretion were studied in vivo. RESULTS: Indomethacin, in vitro and in vivo. induces an increase in erythorcyte CA I and CA II activity. Acetazolamide, a specific inhibitor of CA, reduces the activity of CA I and CA II from red cells. Indomethacin completely antagonizes CA activity, i.e. abolishes the inhibitory effect of acetazolamide on CA. In humans, an increase or decrease in erythrocyte CA II activity is correlated with an increase or decrease in gastric acid secretion. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that indomethacin, a known cyclooxygenase (COX) inhibitor, is also an activator of CA. Our data also prove that indomethacin is not only an activator of CA but also antagonizes the effect of acetazolamide, a specific inhibitor of this enzyme. In view of the role of CA in acid-base balance as well as the fact that an increase or decrease in its activity is accompanied by an increase or decrease in intra- and extracellular pH, our results suggest that: firstly, CA activation induced by indomethacin might cause changes in COX activity; secondly, PGs are synthetized as a consequence of the changes in COX activity, a hypothesis that requires further study.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To report toxicity resulting from donepezil administration following a tenfold dosing error. CASE SUMMARY: A 79-year-old white nursing home patient with a history of Alzheimer disease and hypertension was inadvertently given 50 mg of donepezil instead of her usual 5-mg dose. She presented to the emergency department with nausea, vomiting, and persistent bradycardia (HR in the 40s). Routine laboratory studies were all within normal limits. Basilar rales were noted five hours after arrival. She was treated with atropine 0.2 mg as needed for bradycardia (HR <50 beats/min); a total of 3.0 mg was administered over 18 hours. Each bolus kept her HR >60 beats/min for one-half to two hours. No further vomiting or evidence of pulmonary edema occurred after her initial episodes. She returned to baseline by day 2 (HR in the 70s) and was returned to the nursing home. DISCUSSION: Donepezil is a centrally acting, reversible cholinesterase inhibitor that is used in the treatment of Alzheimer disease. Donepezil is highly specific for neural acetylcholinesterases, preferentially binding acetylcholinesterase by greater than three orders of magnitude over butyrylcholinesterases. This specificity minimizes peripheral adverse effects at therapeutic doses. Our patient mainly experienced bradycardia and had minimal secretory effects compared with what is usually seen with nonspecific cholinesterase inhibition. Medication errors like the one that produced this overdose are a common but preventable cause of morbidity in healthcare facilities. CONCLUSIONS: A tenfold dosing error caused donepezil toxicity. The main effect of this overdose was bradycardia, which responded to atropine therapy.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The use of selective 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 receptor antagonists has improved the management of postoperative nausea and vomiting, but has not completely eliminated it. In this article, we discuss the pharmacology of 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 receptor antagonists and the impact of pharmacogenetics on postoperative nausea and vomiting. RECENT FINDINGS: Dolasetron, granisetron, ondansetron, palonosetron, and tropisetron have similar mechanisms of action but different pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties. Genetic polymorphism in the cytochrome P450 mono-oxygenase system, drug efflux transporter adenosine triphosphate-binding cassette subfamily B member 1 and 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 receptor subunits also contribute to the interindividual variation in response to different 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 receptor antagonists. These differences account for differences in the duration of action and clinical efficacy of these agents. SUMMARY: Pharmacogenetics testing in patients may help differentiate responders to 5-hydroxytryptamine type 3 receptor antagonists from non-responders and allow the anesthesiologist to individualize antiemetic therapy. The cost-effectiveness of such screening in postoperative nausea and vomiting management has, however, not been evaluated. Given the multifactorial nature of postoperative nausea and vomiting, a multimodal approach to reduce or eliminate risk factors will be most successful in its management.",

        "title": "Carbonic anhydrase in mammalian vascular smooth muscle.",
        "abstract": "Carbonic anhydrase (CA) is ubiquitously expressed and plays a pivotal role in acid-base balance, ion transport, and gas exchange. Limited observations by others, derived from functional, pharmacological, and histochemical studies, suggest that CA is present in vascular smooth muscle and is involved in vasoregulation. The present study, using measurements of bioactivity, inhibition characteristics, and immunohistochemical analysis, was undertaken to more fully evaluate CA in vascular smooth muscle. In isolated bovine aortic smooth muscle, which is devoid of erythrocytes, CA is present in low concentrations with a CO(2) hydration activity (at 0C) of 3.5 +/- 2.7 U/g. The I(50) for acetazolamide inhibition is 0.07 +/- 0.01 microM. Results with dorzolamide and bromopyruvate, selective inhibitors of the CA II and I isozymes, respectively, show that roughly 75% of the CA activity is accounted for by CA I, with 20% due to CA II. These results accord qualitatively with immunocytochemical staining with specific CA I and II antibodies, showing that both isozymes are present and that their staining co-localizes with cells positive for smooth muscle alpha-actin. These data establish the activity, inhibition, and isozyme pattern of carbonic anhydrase expression in mammalian vascular smooth muscle.",

        "abstract": "The authors tested 239 frequently used drugs and other compounds for their potential to inhibit the drug-metabolizing enzyme, aldehyde oxidase, in human liver cytosol. A sensitive, moderate throughput HPLC-MS assay was developed for 1-phthalazinone, the aldehyde oxidase-catalyzed product of phthalazine oxidation. Inhibition of this activity was examined for the 239 drugs and other compounds of interest at a test concentration of 50 microM. Thirty-six compounds exhibited greater than 80% inhibition and were further examined for measurement of IC50. The most potent inhibitor observed was the selective estrogen receptor modulator, raloxifene (IC50=2.9 nM), and tamoxifen, estradiol, and ethinyl estradiol were also potent inhibitors. Other classes of drugs that demonstrated inhibition of aldehyde oxidase included phenothiazines, tricyclic antidepressants, tricyclic atypical antipsychotic agents, and dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, along with some other drugs, including loratadine, cyclobenzaprine, amodiaquine, maprotiline, ondansetron, propafenone, domperidone, quinacrine, ketoconazole, verapamil, tacrine, and salmeterol. These findings are discussed in context to potential drug interactions that could be observed between these agents and drugs for which aldehyde oxidase is involved in metabolism and warrant investigation of the possibility of clinical drug interactions mediated by inhibition of this enzyme.",

        "title": "Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition by perindopril in the treatment of cardiovascular disease.",
        "abstract": "The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor perindopril (Coversyl) is a long-acting lipophilic drug with a high-tissue affinity for the ACE. ACE inhibition by perindopril has two main effects: it inhibits the angiotensin II formation and potentiates bradykinin. Perindopril is one of the ACE inhibitors that has been extensively studied in randomized clinical trials within various patient populations. The clinical efficacy has been demonstrated in patients with hypertension, diabetes mellitus, cerebrovascular disease, stable coronary artery disease (CAD) and heart failure. Perindopril has a positive safety and tolerability profile. Therefore, perindopril, as an ACE inhibitor, has an established place in the major clinical treatment guidelines. This article discusses several studies that have shown that an antihypertensive treatment with perindopril reduces and prevents cardiovascular events in a large range of patients with established vascular disease. The observed cardioprotective benefits of perindopril were independent of blood pressure. The outcome of these and other trials support the concept of specific cardioprotective properties of ACE inhibition by perindopril in addition to the blood pressure-lowering effects, such as anti-atherosclerotic, anti-inflammatory and antithrombotic properties. In addition, the observed consistency of the treatment benefit across subgroups indicates that the absolute benefits conferred by treatment are mainly established by each patient's future risk of vascular complications, rather than their initial blood pressure level or other risk factors. This article describes these issues according to the main studies with perindopril or perindopril-based regimens, concluding that the blood pressure-dependent and -independent cardioprotective effects extend to all patients with vascular disease. This concept supports the provision of ACE inhibitor-based treatment, not on the basis of arbitrary cut-off points for blood pressure but rather on assessment of vascular risk, which is raised in patients with stable CAD, diabetes and stroke.",

        "abstract": "A series of phenolic acids and phenol natural products, such as p-hydroxybenzoic acid, p-coumaric acid, caffeic acid, ferulic acid, gallic acid, syringic acid, quercetin, and ellagic acid, were investigated for their inhibitory effects against the metalloenzyme carbonic anhydrase (CA, EC 4.2.1.1). All mammalian isozymes of human (h) or murine (m) origin hCA I-hCA XII, mCA XIII and hCA XIV were inhibited in the low micromolar or submicromolar range by these (poly)phenols (K(I)s in the range of 0.87-7.79 microM). p-Hydroxybenzoic acid was the best inhibitor of all isozymes (K(I)s of 0.87-35.4 microM) and the different isozymes showed very variable inhibition profiles with these derivatives. Phenols like the ones investigated here possess a CA inhibition mechanism distinct of that of the sulfonamides/sulfamates used clinically or the coumarins. Unlike the sulfonamides, which bind to the catalytic zinc ion, phenols are anchored at the Zn(II)-coordinated water molecule and bind more externally within the active site cavity, making contacts with various amino acid residues. As this is the region with the highest variability between the many CA isozymes found in mammals, this class of compounds may lead to isoform-selective inhibitors targeting just one or few of the medicinally relevant CAs.",

        "abstract": "The molybdenum cofactor sulfurase ABA3 from Arabidopsis thaliana specifically regulates the activity of the molybdenum enzymes aldehyde oxidase and xanthine dehydrogenase by converting their molybdenum cofactor from the desulfo-form into the sulfo-form. ABA3 is a two-domain protein with an NH2-terminal domain sharing significant similarities to NifS proteins that catalyze the decomposition of l-cysteine to l-alanine and elemental sulfur for iron-sulfur cluster synthesis. Although different in its physiological function, the mechanism of ABA3 for sulfur mobilization was found to be similar to NifS proteins. The protein binds a pyridoxal phosphate cofactor and a substrate-derived persulfide intermediate, and site-directed mutagenesis of strictly conserved binding sites for the cofactor and the persulfide demonstrated that they are essential for molybdenum cofactor sulfurase activity. In vitro, the NifS-like domain of ABA3 activates aldehyde oxidase and xanthine dehydrogenase in the absence of the C-terminal domain, but in vivo, the C-terminal domain is required for proper activation of both target enzymes. In addition to its cysteine desulfurase activity, ABA3-NifS also exhibits selenocysteine lyase activity. Although l-selenocysteine is unlikely to be a natural substrate for ABA3, it is decomposed more efficiently than l-cysteine. Besides mitochondrial AtNFS1 and plastidial AtNFS2, which are both proposed to be involved in iron-sulfur cluster formation, ABA3 is proposed to be a third and cytosolic NifS-like cysteine desulfurase in A. thaliana. However, the sulfur transferase activity of ABA3 is used for post-translational activation of molybdenum enzymes rather than for iron-sulfur cluster assembly.",

        "abstract": "Several alpha-adrenergic antagonists inhibited the activation of calmodulin-stimulated phosphodiesterase at concentrations that had little or no effect on basal phosphodiesterase activity. The most potent of these compounds were phenoxybenzamine and dibenamine (IC50 values of about 1 microM); the amino acid ergot alkaloids ergocryptine, ergocristine, ergotamine and their dihydrogenated derivatives were less potent calmodulin-inhibitors (IC50 values of 35-80 microM). The amino ergot alkaloids ergonovine and methysergide were essentially devoid of inhibitory activity. A variety of other alpha 1-antagonists (phentolamine, tolazoline and prazosin), an alpha 2-antagonist (yohimbine), alpha-agonists (norepinephrine, phenylephrine and clonidine), beta-adrenergic antagonists (propranolol and practolol) and the beta-adrenergic agonist methoxyphenamine displayed little or no anti-calmodulin activity (IC50 values greater than 300 microM). Similarly, the alkylating agents chlorambucil and mechlorethamine also failed to inhibit calmodulin activity. Phenoxybenzamine and dibenamine inhibited calmodulin activity irreversibly, whereas the inhibition caused by other alpha adrenergic blocking agents was reversible. Phenoxybenzamine inhibited calmodulin activity by binding directly to it. This binding was calcium-dependent and irreversible. The irreversible binding and inhibition of calmodulin activity by phenoxybenzamine (or dibenamine) may serve as a useful tool for studying the sites at which drugs bind to calmodulin and may also be useful for studying the distribution and turnover of calmodulin.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Fluid transport by the corneal endothelium is dependent on the presence of HCO(3)(-) and the activity of carbonic anhydrase (CA)-II and -IV, the cytoplasmic and membrane-bound CAs, respectively. This study was conducted to examine the inhibition of CA activity in cultured bovine corneal endothelial cells (BCECs) by dorzolamide, a topical CA inhibitor used in glaucoma therapy. METHODS: BCECs were grown on glass coverslips and then perfused with HCO(3)(-)-free Ringer's. The inward flux of CO(2) was induced by exposure to CO(2)-HCO(3)(-) Ringer's and the opposing outward flux by returning to HCO(3)(-)-free Ringer's. Consequent transients in intracellular pH (pH(i)) were measured using the pH-sensitive fluorescent dye 2',7'-bis-(2-carboxyethyl)-5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein (BCECF). During the inward flux of CO(2,) the maximum rate of change of pH(i) was taken as a quantitative measure of the overall CA activity in BCECs. RESULTS: Exposure to CO(2)-HCO(3)(-) Ringer's led to a transient decrease in pH(i) (component A), followed by a rapid increase to a new steady state (component B). However, when the CO(2)-HCO(3)(-) Ringer's was removed, the pH(i) increased transiently (component C) and then rapidly returned to the original pH(i) (component D). Component A, caused by an inward flux of CO(2) and its subsequent hydration by CA-II, was blocked by dorzolamide in a dose-dependent manner with an 50% inhibitory concentration (IC)(50) of 2.4 micro M (95% confidence interval: 0.5 -10.85 microM). However, the inhibition of the outward flux of CO(2), inward flux of HCO(3)(-), and outward flux of HCO(3)(-) (associated with components C, B, and D, respectively) was not dose dependent. Cells that were exposed to 500 nM of the drug for longer than 30 minutes did not show a significantly greater inhibition of any of the components. Dorzolamide and acetazolamide (500 microM) did not show additive inhibition of any of the components (P = 0.13; n = 6). CONCLUSIONS: Dorzolamide significantly inhibits CA activity in BCECs at micromolar levels. Because these levels are encountered in the cornea and aqueous humor after topical administration, dorzolamide may compromise corneal hydration control, especially when the functional reserve of corneal endothelium is low. Dorzolamide does not appear to accumulate in the cells, because the inhibition of CA-II did not increase after prolonged exposure to the drug.",

The modeled BtChoEase structure closely resembled that of AcChoEase in overall features. However, six conserved aromatic residues that line the active-site gorge, which is a prominent feature of the AcChoEase structure, are absent in BtChoEase. Modeling showed that two such residues, Phe-288 and Phe-290, replaced by leucine and valine, respectively, in BtChoEase, may prevent entrance of butyrylcholine into the acyl-binding pocket. Their mutation to leucine and valine in AcChoEase, by site-directed mutagenesis, produced a double mutant that hydrolyzed butyrylthiocholine almost as well as acetylthiocholine. The mutated enzyme was also inhibited well by the bulky, BtChoEase-selective organophosphate inhibitor (tetraisopropylpyrophosphoramide, iso-OMPA). Trp-279, at the entrance of the active-site gorge in AcChoEase, is absent in BtChoEase. Modeling designated it as part of the \"peripheral\" anionic site, which is lacking in BtChoEase.

We examined whether minocycline inhibited human aortic smooth muscle cell (HASMC) migration induced by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). After the establishment of an optimal dose, minocycline treated HASMC were exposed to VEGF. HASMC migration, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 and MMP-9 activities, mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), and phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) phosphorylation were determined by smooth muscle cell (SMC) invasion assay, real-time polymerase chain reaction, zymograms, and Western blot analysis, respectively. We demonstrated that VEGF and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-induced SMC migration in a dose-dependent manner. MMP-9, but not MMP-2, mRNA was increased during VEGF stimulation. MMP-9 activity was increased from 1.5- to 2.5-fold in a dose-dependent manner (P&lt;0.05). Both ERK1/2 and PI3K/AKt pathways were activated during VEGF-induced HASMCs migration. We then demonstrated that minocycline can inhibit VEGF-induced HASMC migration (P&lt;0.05). The effects may be through the inhibition of MMP-9 mRNA transcription, protein activities and downregulation of ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt pathway phosphorylation. Our results indicated that minocycline exerts multiple effects on VEGF-induced SMC migration, including inhibition of MMP-9 mRNA transcription and protein activities and downregulating ERK1/2 and PI3K signal pathways, suggesting minocycline may be a potentially therapeutic approach to inhibit disease process induced angiogenesis.",

        "title": "Pharmacological and ocular hypotensive properties of topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors.",
        "abstract": "There was a time gap of over 40 years between the demonstrated oral effectiveness of acetazolamide in lowering the intraocular pressure (IOP) of glaucoma patients and the introduction of a topical carbonic anhydrase (CA) inhibitor. This is due to the fact that CA-II, the isoenzyme which most likely plays an important role in the production of aqueous humor in humans, must be essentially inhibited by 100% to elicit a pharmacological response. The lack of success with earlier attempts to obtain a topical agent stems from an inability to attain and maintain a sufficiently high intraocular concentration of drug to achieve the required inhibition of CA. Dorzolamide and brinzolamide are two topical CA inhibitors which are currently available to treat ocular hypertension and/or glaucoma. Dorzolamide is a very potent inhibitor of CA-II and its site of action is local within the eye. Like oral CA inhibitors, topically applied dorzolamide lowers IOP by decreasing the production of aqueous humor. The drug is used in monotherapy as a 2% solution administered three times daily. Its ocular hypotensive effect is comparable to that of timolol at peak but is somewhat less at trough. The IOP lowering effect of timolol is enhanced by the twice daily administration of 2% dorzolamide either concomitantly or in combination. Topically applied dorzolamide is generally well tolerated and had a low drop-out rate in clinical studies. The most frequent ocular adverse experience is burning and/or stinging. Corneal and lenticular problems have generally not been encountered with long-term therapy with dorzolamide. Topically applied dorzolamide penetrates directly to the posterior segment of the eye and its presence is consistent with the initial report that dorzolamide increases retinal blood flow velocity in patients with normal tension glaucoma. The most frequent systemic adverse experience is a transient bitter taste. Biochemical changes indicative of the systemic inhibition of CA have not been observed in monotherapy studies lasting up to 2 years. This is in harmony with the inability of dorzolamide at steady-state to saturate CA in the red blood cell and the failure to detect its presence in plasma. A 1% suspension of brinzolamide is comparable to 2% dorzolamide in lowering IOP, both drugs being administered three times daily. Although brinzolamide has a lower incidence of burning/ stinging, it elicits more blurred vision.",

P and its 18-substituted derivatives bind to the recombinant human MR (hMR) overexpressed in Sf9 cells with the following hierarchy of affinity: P &gt; aldosterone &gt; 18VP &gt; 18EP &gt;&gt; 18OVP. Functional cotransfection assays in CV-1 cells, using mouse mammary tumor virus promoter as a steroid receptor-inducible DNA target sequence, indicated that the mineralocorticoid activity depends on the nature of the C18 substituent. 18VP and 18EP retained the antimineralocorticoid feature of P, with the following order of activity: P = 18VP &gt; 18EP. The antagonist potency of 18VP was higher (IC50, approximately 10(-8) M) than that of spironolactone (IC50, approximately 7 x 10(-8) M), the most widely used aldosterone antagonist. Interestingly, introducing an oxo function at C18 conferred agonist mineralocorticoid properties; 18OVP behaves as a full agonist (ED50, approximately 10(-7) M) with no antagonist activity. In contrast to what was observed when the three 18-substituted P derivatives acted through hMR, they retained the agonist feature of P through the human P receptor, with the following order of potency: P &gt; 18VP = 18OVP &gt; 18EP. The activity of the 18-substituted P derivatives through the human glucocorticoid receptor was only detected at concentrations higher than 10(-6) M; P and 18VP displayed a partial antagonist activity, whereas 18OVP had a full agonist activity (ED50, approximately 2 x 10(-6) M). Thus, the presence of an oxo group at C18(18OVP) does not change the agonist feature of P through human P receptor, but confers to the ligand an agonist activity through hMR, suggesting that the C18 carbonyl group of aldosterone plays a crucial role in its agonist activity.",

As part of the assessment of the potential for side-effects associated with their use, their activities, not only at the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) but also at the other members of the steroid nuclear receptor family, have been compared. Cell-based functional systems were established to measure different aspects of GR function, as well as the activity at all the other steroid nuclear receptors. The effects of MF and FP on the GR were potent and indistinguishable. Neither corticosteroid showed any activity at the oestrogen receptor, while both were weak antagonists of the androgen receptor. FP was a relatively weak agonist of the progesterone receptor but MF was a very potent agonist of the progesterone receptor, giving activity at similar concentrations to those that stimulate the GR (concentration generating 50% maximal effect (EC50)=50 pM). Moreover, while FP was a weak antagonist of the mineralocorticoid receptor (concentration generating 50% maximal inhibitory effect=80 nM), MF displayed potent partial agonist activity (EC50=3 nM, 30%). Mometasone furoate is considerably less specific for the glucocorticoid receptor than fluticasone propionate, showing significant activity at other nuclear steroid receptors.",

Topotecan mimics a DNA base pair and binds at the site of DNA cleavage by intercalating between the upstream (-1) and downstream (+1) base pairs. Intercalation displaces the downstream DNA, thus preventing religation of the cleaved strand. By specifically binding to the enzyme-substrate complex, Topotecan acts as an uncompetitive inhibitor. The structure can explain several of the known structure-activity relationships of the camptothecin family of anticancer drugs and suggests that there are at least two classes of mutations that can produce a drug-resistant enzyme. The first class includes changes to residues that contribute to direct interactions with the drug, whereas a second class would alter interactions with the DNA and thereby destabilize the drug-binding site.",

However, the in vivo effects of these drugs in K+-deficient rats, the animal model of familial hypokalaemic periodic paralysis(hypokalaemic-PP), are currently unknown. Measures of insulin-responses, serum electrolytes levels and patch-clamp experiments were therefore performed in K+ -deficient rats treated in vivo with dichlorphenamide (DCP), ethoxzolamide (ETX), hydrochlorthiazide (HCT), methazolamide (MTZ), bendroflumethiazide (BFT) and acetazolamide (ACTZ). Ten days treatments of K+-deficient rats with DCP, BFT, ETX and ACTZ (5.6 mg/kg per day) restored the serum [K+] to control values and prevented the insulin-induced paralysis. In ex vivo experiments, the carbonic-anhydrase inhibitors enhanced the activity of Ca2+-activated-K+ channels with the order of efficacy: ACTZ&gt;BFT&gt;ETX&gt;DCP. In contrast, HCT and MTZ failed to stimulate the Ca2+-activated-K+ channels and to prevent the hypokalaemia and paralysis. At the concentration of 1mg/kg per day, all these drugs failed to ameliorate the hypokalaemic-PP symptoms. The activation of Ca2+-activated-K+ channel in addition to the mild diuretic effect explained the efficacy of ACTZ and DCP in K+ -deficient rats and in familial hypokalaemic-PP.",

One of the potential alternative therapies for renal cell carcinoma may be inhibition of angiogenesis. In this study, we analysed the inhibitory effects of several potential agents on expression of angiogenic factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor, which are the main mediators in angiogenesis of renal cell carcinoma. We used medroxyprogesterone acetate, interferon-alpha, interferon-gamma, minocycline hydrochrolide and genistein, which are known to be antiangiogeneic. Northern blot analyses revealed that, among the five agents examined, genistein had a strong inhibitory effect on expression of vascular endothelial growth factor mRNA and basic fibroblast growth factor mRNA. Medroxyprogesterone acetate and interferon-alpha did not significantly decrease the level of either vascular endothelial growth factor mRNA or basic fibroblast growth factor mRNA. Interferon-gamma and minocycline had mild inhibitory effects on vascular endothelial growth factor mRNA and basic fibroblast growth factor mRNA expression. Genistein also inhibited both vascular endothelial growth factor mRNA and basic fibroblast growth factor mRNA expression after treatment with epidermal growth factor and hypoxia. These findings suggest that one of the mechanisms of the inhibition of angiogenesis by genistein is suppression of the expression of the angiogenic factors vascular endothelial growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor in renal cell carcinoma.",

Emedastine exhibited the highest affinity for H1-receptors (dissociation constant, Ki = 1.3 +/- 0.1 nM), and was considerably weaker at H2- (K1 = 49,067 +/- 11,113 nM) and H3-receptors (Ki = 12,430 +/- 1,282 nM). These data yielded ratios of 37744, 9562 and 4 for H2:H1, H3:H1 and H2:H3 receptor affinities, respectively, thus making emedastine a very selective H1-receptor antagonist. The H1-selectivity of emedastine was considerably superior to that of pyrilamine (H2:H1, H3:H1 and H2:H3 ratios of 11887, 12709 and 1, respectively). Similarly, the respective receptor affinity ratios for ketotifen (858, 1752, 0.5), levocabastine (420, 82, 5), pheniramine (430, 312, 1), chlorpheniramine (5700, 2216, 3) and antazoline (1163, 1110, 1) showed these antihistamines to be also markedly less H1-selective than emedastine. The potency of emedastine (IC50 = 1.44 +/- 0.3 nM) for antagonizing histamine-induced phosphoinositide turnover in human trabecular meshwork cells compared well with its binding affinity at the H1-receptor.

Lumbar CSF samples were collected continuously (0.1 mL x min(-1)) for 49 hours from eight healthy volunteers who took either placebo or a single oral dose of rivastigmine (3 mg). CSF specimens and samples of blood cells and blood plasma were analyzed at intervals for rivastigmine and its metabolite NAP 226-90 ([-] [3-([1-dimethylaminolethyl)-phenol]), erythrocyte AChE activity, CSF AChE activity, and plasma and CSF butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) activity. Safety evaluations were performed 23 hours after drug dosing and at the end of the study. Evaluable data were obtained from six subjects. The mean time to maximal rivastigmine plasma concentration (tmax) was 0.83 +/- 0.26 hours, the mean maximal plasma concentration (Cmax) was 4.88 +/- 3.82 ng x mL(-1), the mean plasma area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC0-infinity) was 7.43 +/- 4.74 ng x hr x mL(-1), and the mean plasma t1/2 was 0.85 +/- 0.115 hours. The concentration of rivastigmine in CSF was lower than the quantification limit for assay (0.65 ng x mL(-1)), but NAP 226-90 reached a mean Cmax of 3.14 +/- 0.57 ng x mL(-1). Only minimal inhibition of erythrocyte AChE activity (approximately 3%) was observed. Inhibition of AChE in the CSF after rivastigmine administration was significantly greater than after placebo for up to 8.4 hours after the dose and was maximal (40%) at 2.4 hours. Plasma BuChE activity was significantly lower after rivastigmine than after placebo, but this was not clinically relevant. BuChE activity in CSF was significantly lower after rivastigmine than after placebo for up to 3.6 hours after dosing, but this difference was not sustained. This study confirms the feasibility of using continuous measurement of AChE activity in CSF over prolonged periods, that rivastigmine markedly inhibits CSF AChE after a single oral dose of 3 mg, and that the inhibition of central AChE is substantially greater than that of peripheral AChE or BuChE.",

        "abstract": "Hypertension and cardiac remodeling are associated with myocardial fibrosis, left ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, and diastolic heart failure. Fenofibrate suppresses aldosterone-mediated increases in myocyte matrix metalloproteinase activity and extracellular signal-regulated kinase phosphorylation. It is unknown whether the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha agonist, fenofibrate, improves cardiac remodeling in a model of aldosterone-induced hypertension and LV hypertrophy. Twelve-week-old uninephrectomized FVB mice received 1% NaCl drinking water. Miniosmotic pumps delivered saline or aldosterone for 4 weeks. Mice were either untreated (n=14) or treated with fenofibrate 100 mg/kg per day (n=12) for 1 week before and 4 weeks after surgery. Aldosterone increased systolic blood pressure in untreated mice versus saline-untreated mice (134+/-3 versus 91+/-3 mm Hg; P&lt;0.01). This was unaffected by fenofibrate (131+/-3 mm Hg). Aldosterone increased LV end-diastolic and end-systolic dimensions, which were significantly attenuated by fenofibrate (3.8+/-0.1 versus 3.5+/-0.1 mm, and 1.5+/-0.1 versus 1.15+/-0.1 mm, respectively). Fenofibrate also decreased aldosterone-induced LV hypertrophy (LV weight/body weight, 4.1+/-0.2 versus 4.6+/-0.1 mg/g) and improved percent LV fractional shortening (67+/-7% versus 60+/-2%). Additionally, fenofibrate ameliorated the increased matrix metalloproteinase-2/tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinase-2 ratio and fibrosis seen in aldosterone-untreated hearts (P&lt;0.05 for both). Furthermore, in aldosterone-untreated hearts, fenofibrate decreased transforming growth factor-beta, collagen type III (P&lt;0.05 for both), and collagen type I (P&lt;0.01) protein expression. Conversely fenofibrate increased peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma coactivator-1alpha expression, and acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase phosphorylation (P&lt;0.05 for all) in aldosterone-infused hearts; uncoupling protein-3 and medium-chain acyl coenzyme A dehydrogenase protein expression decreased with fenofibrate (P&lt;0.05 and P&lt;0.01, respectively, versus aldosterone-infused), suggesting that improved myocardial remodeling is independent of fatty acid oxidation. Thus, fenofibrate improved aldosterone-induced LV hypertrophy independently of an effect on blood pressure with decreased fibrosis and altered extracellular matrix.",

Based on these potent effects on gonadal function in vivo as well as previous work in vitro demonstrating affinity of ketoconazole for receptor proteins for glucocorticoids and 1,25(OH)2 vitamin D3 and for sex steroid binding globulin (SSBG), the binding of ketoconazole to human androgen receptors (AR) in vitro was also examined. Ketoconazole competition with [3H]methyltrienolone (R1881) for androgen binding sites in dispersed, intact cultured human skin fibroblasts was determined at 22 degrees C. Fifty percent displacement of [3H]R1881 binding to AR was achieved by 6.4 +/- 1.8 (SE) x 10(-5) M ketoconazole. Additional binding studies performed with ketoconazole in the presence of increasing amounts of [3H]R1881 showed that the interaction of ketoconazole with AR was competitive when the data were analyzed by the Scatchard method. It should be noted, however, that the dose of ketoconazole required for 50% occupancy of the androgen receptor is not likely to be achieved in vivo, at least in plasma. Finally, androgen binding studies performed with other imidazoles, such as clotrimazole, miconazole, and fluconozole, revealed that in this class of compounds only ketoconazole appears to interact with the androgen receptor. Ketoconazole appears to be the first example of a non-steroidal compound which binds competitively to both SSBG and multiple steroid hormone receptors, suggesting that the ligand binding sites of these proteins share some features in common.",

In the present work, pimozide, thioridazine, W-13, and W-12 were shown to inhibit MCF-7 human breast cancer cell growth. The 50% inhibition concentration values determined in two proliferation assays, [3H]thymidine incorporation and cell number, were in close agreement for each compound tested. The order of potency for growth inhibition in the presence of 2% stripped calf serum was pimozide (Ki 2 microM) greater than thioridazine (Ki 5 microM) greater than W-13 (Ki 15 microM) greater than W-12 (Ki 39 microM). Similar concentrations of these compounds blocked estradiol-induced growth of MCF-7 cells, but estrogen receptor (ER) interactions do not seem to be involved. Pimozide and thioridazine had no effect on the estradiol binding properties of the MCF-7 ER, nor did pimozide interfere with the induction of progesterone receptors by estradiol. Furthermore, pimozide also inhibited incorporation of [3H]thymidine into MCF-7 cells stimulated by polypeptide hormones in serum-free medium. The Ki for pimozide in serum-free medium alone, 0.46 microM, was similar to that determined in the presence of insulin (0.42 microM), insulin-like growth factor I (0.54 microM), and epidermal growth factor (0.43 microM). The effects of pimozide on breast cancer cell growth were not limited to the MCF-7 cell line. Pimozide also blocked cell growth and [3H]thymidine incorporation into the ER-positive T47D and ZR75-1B human breast cancer cell lines and the ER-negative human breast cancer cell line, MDA-MB-231. Although numerous mechanisms of action of pimozide and thioridazine have been identified, both drugs are calmodulin antagonists at drug concentrations that inhibit breast cancer cell growth in vitro. Inhibition of MCF-7 cell growth by the selective calmodulin antagonists W-13 and W-12 is consistent with a role for calmodulin antagonism in the broad growth-inhibitory properties of pimozide. We conclude that pimozide and thioridazine may be useful in the control of estradiol- and polypeptide hormone-induced growth of ER-positive and ER-negative human breast tumors.",

In this study, in contrast to NT1 receptor, levocabastine (a histamine H1 receptor antagonist) and SR48692 (an antagonist for NT1 receptor) strongly stimulated intracellular Ca2+ mobilization in transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing rat NT2 receptor, thus acting as potent NT2 receptor. Furthermore, despite of their affinities for NT2 receptor, the Ca2+ responses to potent NT1 agonists, neurotensin or JMV449 ([Lys8-(CH2NH)-Lys9]Pro-Tyr-Ile-Leu, a peptidase resistant analogue of neurotensin) were much smaller than that observed with SR48692.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Since the introduction of the first cholinesterase inhibitor (ChEI) in 1997, most clinicians and probably most patients would consider the cholinergic drugs, donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine, to be the first line pharmacotherapy for mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.The drugs have slightly different pharmacological properties, but they all work by inhibiting the breakdown of acetylcholine, an important neurotransmitter associated with memory, by blocking the enzyme acetylcholinesterase. The most that these drugs could achieve is to modify the manifestations of Alzheimer's disease. Cochrane reviews of each ChEI for Alzheimer's disease have been completed (Birks 2005, Birks 2005b and Loy 2005). Despite the evidence from the clinical studies and the intervening clinical experience the debate on whether ChEIs are effective continues. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of donepezil, galantamine and rivastigmine in people with mild, moderate or severe dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. SEARCH STRATEGY: The Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group's Specialized Register was searched using the terms 'donepezil', 'E2020' , 'Aricept' , galanthamin* galantamin* reminyl, rivastigmine, exelon, \"ENA 713\" and ENA-713 on 12 June 2005. This Register contains up-to-date records of all major health care databases and many ongoing trial databases. SELECTION CRITERIA: All unconfounded, blinded, randomized trials in which treatment with a ChEI was compared with placebo or another ChEI for patients with mild, moderate or severe dementia due to Alzheimer's disease. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data were extracted by one reviewer (JSB), pooled where appropriate and possible, and the pooled treatment effects, or the risks and benefits of treatment estimated. MAIN RESULTS: The results of 13 randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trials demonstrate that treatment for periods of 6 months and one year, with donepezil, galantamine or rivastigmine at the recommended dose for people with mild, moderate or severe dementia due to Alzheimer's disease produced improvements in cognitive function, on average -2.7 points (95%CI -3.0 to -2.3), in the midrange of the 70 point ADAS-Cog Scale. Study clinicians blind to other measures rated global clinical state more positively in treated patients. Benefits of treatment were also seen on measures of activities of daily living and behaviour. None of these treatment effects are large. There is nothing to suggest the effects are less for patients with severe dementia or mild dementia, although there is very little evidence for other than mild to moderate dementia.More patients leave ChEI treatment groups, approximately 29 %, on account of adverse events than leave the placebo groups (18%). There is evidence of more adverse events in total in the patients treated with a ChEI than with placebo. Although many types of adverse event were reported, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, were significantly more frequent in the ChEI groups than in placebo. There are four studies, all supported by one of the pharmaceutical companies, in which two ChEIs were compared, two studies of donepezil compared with galantamine, and two of donepezil compared with rivastigmine. In three studies the patients were not blinded to treatment, only the fourth, DON vs RIV/Bullock is double blind. Two of the studies provide little evidence, they are of 12 weeks duration, which is barely long enough to complete the drug titration. There is no evidence from DON vs GAL/Wilcock of a treatment difference between donepezil and galantamine at 52 weeks for cognition, activities of daily living, the numbers who leave the trial before the end of treatment, the number who suffer any adverse event, or any specific adverse event. There is no evidence from DON vs RIV/Bullock of a difference between donepezil and rivastigmine for cognitive function, activities of daily living and behavioural disturbance at two years. Fewer patients suffer adverse events on donepezil than rivastigmine. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The three cholinesterase inhibitors are efficacious for mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. It is not possible to identify those who will respond to treatment prior to treatment. There is no evidence that treatment with a ChEI is not cost effective. Despite the slight variations in the mode of action of the three cholinesterase inhibitors there is no evidence of any differences between them with respect to efficacy. There appears to be less adverse effects associated with donepezil compared with rivastigmine. It may be that galantamine and rivastigmine match donepezil in tolerability if a careful and gradual titration routine over more than three months is used. Titration with donepezil is more straightforward and the lower dose may be worth consideration.",

        "title": "Differential interactions of heparin and heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans with the selectins. Implications for the use of unfractionated and low molecular weight heparins as therapeutic agents.",
        "abstract": "The selectins are calcium-dependent C-type lectins that bind certain sialylated, fucosylated, sulfated glycoprotein ligands. L-selectin also recognizes endothelial proteoglycans in a calcium-dependent manner, via heparan sulfate (HS) glycosaminoglycan chains enriched in unsubstituted glucosamine units. We now show that these HS chains can also bind P-selectin, but not E-selectin. However, while L-selectin binding requires micromolar levels of free calcium, P-selectin recognition is largely divalent cation-independent. Despite this, HS chains bound to P-selectin are eluted by ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), but only at high concentrations. Porcine intestinal mucosal (mast cell-derived) heparin (PIM-heparin) shows similar properties, with no binding to E-selectin, calcium-dependent binding of a subfraction to L-selectin and to P-selectin, and calcium-independent binding of a larger fraction to P-selectin, the latter being disrupted by high EDTA concentrations. Analysis of defined heparin fragment pools shows a size dependence for interaction, with tetradecasaccharides showing easily detectable binding to L- and P-selectin affinity columns. L-selectin binding fragments include more heavily sulfated and epimerized regions and, as with the endothelial HS chains, they are enriched in free amino groups. The P-selectin binding component includes this fraction as well as some less highly modified regions. Thus, endothelium-derived HS chains and mast cell-derived heparins could play a role in modulating the biology of selectins in vivo. Notably, P- and L-selectin binding to sialyl-Lewisx and to HL-60 cells (which are known to carry the native ligand PSGL-1) is inhibited by unfractionated pharmaceutical heparin preparations at concentrations 12-50-fold lower than those recommended for effective anticoagulation in vivo. In contrast, two low molecular weight heparins currently considered as clinical replacements for unfractionated heparin are much poorer inhibitors. Thus, patients undergoing heparin therapy for other reasons may be experiencing clinically significant inhibition of L- and P-selectin function, and the current switchover to low-molecular weight heparins may come at some loss of this effect. Low-dose unfractionated heparin should be investigated as a treatment option for acute and chronic diseases in which P- and L-selectin play pathological roles.",

        "title": "Kinetic analysis of heparin and glucan sulfates binding to P-selectin and its impact on the general understanding of selectin inhibition.",
        "abstract": "P-Selectin, expressed on activated endothelial cells and platelets, is a high kinetic adhesion receptor involved in leukocyte rolling of the inflammatory response, or in tumor cell binding in the course of metastasis. Thus, P-selectin inhibition is a promising therapeutic target. The anti-inflammatory and anti-metastatic activities of heparin have partly been related to the inhibition of P-selectin binding. Here we apply a quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) biosensor to determine the kinetic constants of heparin and other sulfated polysaccharides binding to immobilized P-selectin. Binding kinetics of the derivatives were correlated with their inhibitory capacity in a P-selectin cell rolling assay. Three commercial heparins differ in cell rolling inhibition and display slightly different affinities (KD 1.21 x 10(-6) M to 5.86 x 10(-7) M). Inhibitory capacity appears to be mainly driven by a slow off-rate from the receptor (2.27 x 10(-3) s-1 to 1.23 x 10(-3) s-1). To correlate the impact of binding kinetics on inhibitory capacity structurally, we analyzed six semisynthetic glucan sulfates. They display different degrees of sulfation (DS), which has a strong influence on inhibitory activity. Kinetic data illustrate that the inhibitory capacity correlates excellently with the off-rate of these polysaccharides (R = 0.99), while the association (on-rate) affects activity to a lesser extent. In general, the consideration of binding kinetics sheds new light on the mechanism of selectin inhibition. A much slower dissociation of the inhibitors from the receptor than the physiological ligands is key for inhibitory capacity. Structurally, highly charged compounds with a slow off-rate, such as heparin or glucan sulfates, appear as potent candidates for P-selectin inhibition.",

        "abstract": "Rosuvastatin (formerly ZD4522) is a new 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase inhibitor (statin) with distinct pharmacologic properties. Compared with most other statins, it is relatively hydrophilic, similar in this respect to pravastatin. Rosuvastatin has been shown to be a comparatively potent inhibitor of HMG-CoA reductase activity in a purified preparation of the catalytic domain of the human enzyme, as well as in rat and human hepatic microsomes. In rat hepatocytes, rosuvastatin was found to have significantly higher potency as an inhibitor of cholesterol synthesis than 5 other statins. Rosuvastatin was approximately 1,000-fold more potent in rat hepatocytes than in rat fibroblasts. Further studies in rat hepatocytes demonstrated that rosuvastatin is taken up into these cells by a high-affinity active uptake process. Rosuvastatin was also taken up selectively into the liver after intravenous administration in rats. Potent and prolonged HMG-CoA reductase inhibitory activity has been demonstrated after oral administration to rats and dogs. Pharmacokinetic studies in humans using oral doses of 5 to 80 mg showed that maximum plasma concentrations and areas under the concentration-time curve are approximately linear with dose. The terminal half-life is approximately 20 hours. Studies with human hepatic microsomes and human hepatocytes have suggested little or no metabolism via the cytochrome P-450 3A4 isoenzyme. On the basis of these observations, it is suggested that rosuvastatin has the potential to exert a profound effect on atherogenic lipoproteins.",

        "abstract": "A thyroid hormone antagonist has not been previously described. A number of thyroid hormone analogues have been shown to compete with [125I]triiodothyronine ([125I]T3) for binding to the intranuclear thyroid hormone receptor and to have agonist activity proportional to their affinities for the receptors. We report that the benzofuran amiodarone acts as a competitive antagonist to thyroid hormone action as defined by its dose-dependent ability to (a) bind to the thyroid hormone receptor and (b) inhibit T3-induced increases in growth hormone mRNA levels in a cultured rat pituitary cell line, GC cells. Like T3 itself, amiodarone also decreases transport of [125I]T3 across GC cell membranes. An analysis of the amiodarone structure suggests that this compound has certain similarities to T3. These findings hold promise for the development of other thyroid hormone antagonists for clinical use and for understanding thyroid hormone action.",

        "abstract": "The current reference treatment of hormone-refractory prostate cancer consists mainly of chemotherapy with docetaxel. To improve the management of advanced prostate cancer, one should examine the benefits of adding other agents to docetaxel. We examined the growth inhibitory effects of a triple combination, including the anti-epidermal growth factor receptor drug erlotinib, docetaxel and 5-fluoro-5'-deoxyuridine (the main intermediary metabolite of capecitabine), on the human prostate cancer cell lines PC3 and DU145, which are both devoid of androgen receptors. Marked synergistic cytotoxic effects were observed with the application of the double combination of erlotinib-5-fluoro-5'-deoxyuridine for both cell lines and to a lesser magnitude with the triple combination. For PC3 cells, all conditions resulted in synergistic interactions. The combination between erlotinib and docetaxel resulted in an approximately 50% reduction in thymidylate synthase activity (the molecular target of 5-fluorodeoxyuridine monophosphate, the active capecitabine anabolite) with an higher impact observed with DU145 cells than with PC3 cells. Neither erlotinib nor docetaxel alone displayed marked effects on thymidine phosphorylase activity (the enzyme that governs at the cellular level the final and crucial step in the activation cascade of capecitabine), in contrast to their combination that resulted in a strong increase in thymidine phosphorylase activity in PC3 cells. These data may serve as a rational basis for setting up clinical trials in advanced prostate cancer combining epidermal growth factor receptor-targeting agents like erlotinib together with docetaxel and capecitabine.",

        "title": "Old Friends With New Faces: Are Sodium Channel Blockers the Future of Adjunct Pain Medication Management?",
        "abstract": "Providers are being asked to decrease the emphasis and overutilization of long-term opioid therapy, but many are left without proper guidance on appropriate utilization of nonopioid therapies. Furthermore, therapeutic options are quite limited and many providers lack confidence in distinguishing available alternatives. When first-line therapy has failed in a patient, there is an apparent lack of knowledge on how to proceed with choosing subsequent therapy. To choose among alternative agents, an understanding of pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy in targeting various pain conditions is necessary. This article focuses on the use of the carboxamide class of sodium channel blockers (carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, eslicarbazepine) for adjunct pain medication management including research updates in pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, and current evidence for pain along with promising areas of research. It is an evidence update for clinical use of sodium channel blockers, clarifies misconceptions regarding their use, and highlights emerging research for improved pain targets that justifies additional study. We performed a complete review of the literature using the search terms, \"oxcarbazepine,\" \"carbamazepine,\" and \"eslicarbazepine\" in conjunction with \"pharmacokinetics,\" \"adverse effects,\" \"pharmacology,\" \"voltage-gated sodium channel subtype,\" \"neuropathic pain,\" \"inflammatory pain,\" \"metabolism,\" \"epoxide metabolite formation,\" \"drug interactions,\" \"CYP450 interactions,\" \"pain phenotype,\" and \"chronic pain management.\" Databases searched included PubMed and Google Scholar. Package inserts were used for drug structure illustration, adverse reactions, and bioavailability. Pharmacology and pharmacokinetic data were taken from randomized controlled trials evaluating this area as well as in vitro published results. For validity, only peer-reviewed literature was included. Evidence for sodium channel blockers in chronic pain management was limited. This review focuses on highlighting the data available for the use of sodium channel blockers for certain pain syndromes as well as underutilized potential. Emerging literature on sodium channel subtypes and their connection to neuropathic, inflammatory, and mechanical pain transmission is elucidated. The authors also scrutinize literature surrounding the pharmacokinetics of oxcarbazepine and eslicarbazepine to provide clearer guidance to the significance of any drug interactions and refute assumptions made on the basis of structural similarity to carbamazepine and its known undesirable drug interactions. Side effect profiles are outlined and compared, emphasizing the differences between agents. Sodium channel blocker doses used in certain pain syndromes are outlined with a call for further research to better understand their place in chronic pain management. Identification of sodium channel subtypes with links to specific pain conditions and the ability to target them hints at the potential for truly individualized therapy. Sodium channel inhibitors are underutilized on the basis of available evidence, and emerging research has identified this area as promising for additional clinical trials to better guide clinical practice. PERSPECTIVE: This article provides a review of the pharmacology, evidence for pain management, and pharmacokinetics of oxcarbazepine, carbamazepine, and eslicarbazepine. There is a disparity in evidence using sodium channel blockers for pain and this article highlights the potential that is currently underutilized. The authors believe this will catalyze interest for further studies.",

        "title": "An estrogen receptor basis for raloxifene action in bone.",
        "abstract": "Although controversy remains regarding direct effects of estrogen on bone, in vivo data clearly show that estrogens suppress bone turnover, resulting in decreased bone resorption and formation activity. Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs), such as raloxifene, produce effects on bone which are very similar to those of estrogen. In vitro, both raloxifene and estrogen inhibit mammalian osteoclast differentiation and bone resorption activity, but only in the presence of IL-6. Data from a number of ovariectomized rat model manipulations (i.e. hypophysectomy, low calcium diet and drug combinations) demonstrate a strong parallel between the antiosteopenic effects of raloxifene and estrogen. A characteristic action of estrogens on the skeleton is inhibition of longitudinal bone growth, an effect which is not observed with other resorption inhibitors, including calcitonin and bisphosphonates. Consistent with an estrogen-like mechanism on bone, raloxifene inhibits longitudinal bone growth in growing rats. In addition to the overall similarity of the bone activity profile in animals, estrogen and raloxifene also produce similar effects on various signaling pathways relative to the antiosteopenic effect of these two agents. For example, IL-6, a cytokine involved in high turnover bone resorption following estrogen deficiency in rats, is suppressed by both raloxifene and estrogen. Raloxifene and estrogen also produce a similar activation of TGF-beta3 (a cytokine associated with inhibition of osteoclast differentiation and activity) in ovariectomized rats. Like 17beta-estradiol, raloxifene binds with high affinity to both estrogen receptor-alpha (ER alpha) and estrogen receptor-beta (ER beta). Crystal structure analyses have shown that 17beta-estradiol and raloxifene bind to ER alpha with small, but important, differences in three dimensional structure. These subtle differences in the conformation of the ligand:receptor complex are likely the basis for the key pharmacological differences between estrogens and the various SERMs (i.e. raloxifene vs tamoxifen). Raloxifene also produces estrogen-like effects on serum cholesterol metabolism and the vasculature. Thus, while raloxifene exhibits a complete estrogen antagonist in mammary tissue and the uterus, it produces beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system and prevents bone loss via an estrogen receptor mediated mechanism.",

        "abstract": "Penicillin-binding protein (PBP) 2 is the major PBP of five that have been identified in susceptible strains of Staphylococcus aureus. Beta-lactam antibiotic binding to PBP 2 is important for the antibacterial effect. Antibiotic binding to PBP 2 in strain 209P was examined with sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in competition assays using [3H]penicillin as the radiolabel. Clavulanic acid, which is specifically bound by PBP 2, and cefaclor, which is specific for PBP 3, were studied. Cefaclor, which alone appeared not to bind PBP 2, in combination inhibited PBP 2 binding of clavulanic acid. By varying the temperature during radiolabeling with [3H]penicillin in cefaclor competition assays and in direct radiolabeling assays with [3H]cefaclor, it was shown that cefaclor was bound by PBP 2 with high affinity (50% inhibitory concentration, less than or equal to 0.1 microgram/ml) and that the apparent low-affinity binding (50% inhibitory concentration, greater than 10 micrograms/ml) in competition assays performed at 37 degrees C was due to rapid deacylation. Two penicillin-binding peptides of PBP 2 also were identified in fluorographs of PBPs separated by nonequilibrium pH gradient gel and two-dimensional electrophoresis. Rapid deacylation for some antibiotics and the presence of two penicillin-binding peptides are two properties of PBP 2 that should be considered when correlating results of binding assays with effects of beta-lactam antibiotics on S. aureus.",

        "title": "Imipenem-Relebactam and Meropenem-Vaborbactam: Two Novel Carbapenem-beta-Lactamase Inhibitor Combinations.",
        "abstract": "Relebactam (formerly known as MK-7655) is a non-beta-lactam, bicyclic diazabicyclooctane, beta-lactamase inhibitor that is structurally related to avibactam, differing by the addition of a piperidine ring to the 2-position carbonyl group. Vaborbactam (formerly known as RPX7009) is a non-beta-lactam, cyclic, boronic acid-based, beta-lactamase inhibitor. The structure of vaborbactam is unlike any other currently marketed beta-lactamase inhibitor. Both inhibitors display activity against Ambler class A [including extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs), Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemases (KPCs)] and class C beta-lactamases (AmpC). Little is known about the potential for relebactam or vaborbactam to select for resistance; however, inactivation of the porin protein OmpK36 in K. pneumoniae has been reported to confer resistance to both imipenem-relebactam and meropenem-vaborbactam. The addition of relebactam significantly improves the activity of imipenem against most species of Enterobacteriaceae [by lowering the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) by 2- to 128-fold] depending on the presence or absence of beta-lactamase enzymes. Against Pseudomonas aeruginosa, the addition of relebactam also improves the activity of imipenem (MIC reduced eightfold). Based on the data available, the addition of relebactam does not improve the activity of imipenem against Acinetobacter baumannii, Stenotrophomonas maltophilia and most anaerobes. Similar to imipenem-relebactam, the addition of vaborbactam significantly (2- to &gt; 1024-fold MIC reduction) improves the activity of meropenem against most species of Enterobacteriaceae depending on the presence or absence of beta-lactamase enzymes. Limited data suggest that the addition of vaborbactam does not improve the activity of meropenem against A. baumannii, P. aeruginosa, or S. maltophilia. The pharmacokinetics of both relebactam and vaborbactam are described by a two-compartment, linear model and do not appear to be altered by the co-administration of imipenem and meropenem, respectively. Relebactam's approximate volume of distribution (V d) and elimination half-life (t 1/2) of ~ 18 L and 1.2-2.1 h, respectively, are similar to imipenem. Likewise, vaborbactam's V d and t1/2 of ~ 18 L and 1.3-2.0 h, respectively, are comparable to meropenem. Like imipenem and meropenem, relebactam and vaborbactam are both primarily renally excreted, and clearance correlates with creatinine clearance. In vitro and in vivo pharmacodynamic studies have reported bactericidal activity for imipenem-relebactam and meropenem-vaborbactam against various Gram-negative beta-lactamase-producing bacilli that are not inhibited by their respective carbapenems alone. These data also suggest that pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic parameters correlating with efficacy include time above the MIC for the carbapenems and overall exposure for their companion beta-lactamase inhibitors. Phase II clinical trials to date have reported that imipenem-relebactam is as effective as imipenem alone for treatment of complicated intra-abdominal infections and complicated urinary tract infections, including acute pyelonephritis. Imipenem-relebactam is currently in two phase III clinical trials for the treatment of imipenem-resistant bacterial infections, as well as hospital-associated bacterial pneumonia (HABP) and ventilator-associated bacterial pneumonia (VABP). A phase III clinical trial has reported superiority of meropenem-vaborbactam over piperacillin-tazobactam for the treatment of complicated urinary tract infections, including acute pyelonephritis. Meropenem-vaborbactam has recently demonstrated higher clinical cure rates versus best available therapy for the treatment of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE), as well as for HABP and VABP. The safety and tolerability of imipenem-relebactam and meropenem-vaborbactam has been reported in various phase I pharmacokinetic studies and phase II and III clinical trials. Both combinations appear to be well tolerated in healthy subjects and hospitalized patients, with few serious drug-related treatment-emergent adverse events reported to date. In conclusion, relebactam and vaborbactam serve to broaden the spectrum of imipenem and meropenem, respectively, against beta-lactamase-producing Gram-negative bacilli. The exact roles for imipenem-relebactam and meropenem-vaborbactam will be defined by efficacy and safety data from further clinical trials. Potential roles in therapy for these agents include the treatment of suspected or documented infections caused by resistant Gram-negative bacilli-producing ESBL, KPC, and/or AmpC beta-lactamases. The usage of these agents in patients with CRE infections will likely become the standard of care. Finally, increased activity of imipenem-relebactam against P. aeruginosa may be of clinical benefit to patients with suspected or documented P. aeruginosa infections.",

        "abstract": "It is obvious that DA is an important neurotransmitter in vivo. It is involved in a variety of physiological processes such as mental processes, motor function and hormone regulation. In this context, it is quite understandable that a DA D2 receptor antagonist that inhibits the DA D2 receptor regardless of the state of activity of dopaminergic neurotransmission and inhibit the physiological function of DA can have a variety of adverse effects. In contrast to DA D2 antagonists, aripiprazole acts as an antagonist at the DA D2 receptor in the state of excessive dopaminergic neurotransmission, while it acts as an agonist at the DA D2 receptor in the state of low dopaminergic neurotransmission, and thus attempts to bring the state of dopaminergic neurotransmission to normal. This activity of aripiprazole to regulate dopaminergic neurotransmission is physiologically reasonable, and can be regarded as a stabilizing effect, for which aripiprazole is called a dopamine system stabilizer.",

        "abstract": "Despite the optimization of chemotherapy regimens, treatment outcomes for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) are still considered to be disappointing. Thus, clinical research of new treatment strategies is warranted. Several targeted agents have been introduced into clinical trials in NSCLC, but to date, only a few of these new agents can offer hope of a substantial impact on the natural history of the disease. One of the main reasons for the failure of several clinical trials of targeted therapy in lung cancer is that there is multilevel cross-stimulation among the targets of the new biological agents along several pathways of signal transduction that lead to neoplastic events; blocking only one of these pathways, as most first-generation targeted agents do, allows others to act as salvage or escape mechanisms for cancer cells. Sorafenib and sunitinib are two oral multitargeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors. Sorafenib is a multikinase inhibitor that inhibits the kinase activity of both C-RAF and B-RAF and targets the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor family (VEGFR-2 and VEGFR-3) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor family (PDGFR-beta and stem cell factor receptor [KIT]). Sunitinib is a multitargeted inhibitor of PDGFR, KIT, fms-like tyrosine kinase 3, and VEGFR. The kinases targeted and inhibited by sorafenib and sunitinib directly and indirectly regulate tumor growth, survival, and angiogenesis, and this might be expected to result in broad antitumor efficacy. Sorafenib and sunitinib have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma; sunitinib has also been approved for the treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Their mechanism of action, preclinical data, and phase II studies suggest efficacy in the treatment of advanced NSCLC.",

        "abstract": "Aldosterone binds to the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) and exerts fine control over Na+ absorption in renal collecting duct cells (CCDs). Many natural and synthetic steroids can also bind to the MR to produce agonist or antagonist effects. Here, we investigate whether androgenic hormones act as MR agonist or antagonist ligands in CCDs. Testosterone (T), dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and methyltrienolone (R1881), a synthetic androgen agonist, all bind to the MR. R1881 displayed the same affinity for MR as aldosterone. Androgens did not activate the MR transiently expressed in human embryonic kidney 293T cells but did antagonize aldosterone-induced MR trans-activation activity (R1881&gt;DHT&gt;T). Short-circuit current (Isc) experiments, used to measure transepithelial Na+ transport, revealed that 10(-5) M T and DHT or R1881 prevented the increase in the amiloride-sensitive component of Isc caused by aldosterone in mouse mpkCCDcl4 collecting duct cells partially and totally, respectively. In contrast, androgens had no effect on stimulated Isc elicited by the specific glucocorticoid agonist 11beta,17beta-dihydroxy-17alpha-(1-propynyl) and rost-1,4,6-trien-3-one (RU26988). Docking of steroids within the crystal structure of the ligand-binding domain of MR, together with trans-activation studies, revealed that the contacts between the 17beta-hydroxyl group of androgens and the Asn770, Cys942, and Thr945 residues of the ligand-binding cavity stabilize ligand binding complexes but are not strong enough to keep the receptor in its active state. Altogether, these findings indicate that androgen ligands, particularly R1881, act as MR antagonists in aldosterone target cells and provide new insights into the requirements for MR activation to occur and for the designing of new selective MR antagonists.",

        "abstract": "Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) causes sudden cardiac death due to mutations in cardiac ryanodine receptors (RyR2), calsequestrin, or calmodulin. Flecainide, a class I antiarrhythmic drug, inhibits Na(+) and RyR2 channels and prevents CPVT. The purpose of this study is to identify inhibitory mechanisms of flecainide on RyR2. RyR2 were isolated from sheep heart, incorporated into lipid bilayers, and investigated by single-channel recording under various activating conditions, including the presence of cytoplasmic ATP (2 mM) and a range of cytoplasmic [Ca(2+)], [Mg(2+)], pH, and [caffeine]. Flecainide applied to either the cytoplasmic or luminal sides of the membrane inhibited RyR2 by two distinct modes: 1) a fast block consisting of brief substate and closed events with a mean duration of ~1 ms, and 2) a slow block consisting of closed events with a mean duration of ~1 second. Both inhibition modes were alleviated by increasing cytoplasmic pH from 7.4 to 9.5 but were unaffected by luminal pH. The slow block was potentiated in RyR2 channels that had relatively low open probability, whereas the fast block was unaffected by RyR2 activation. These results show that these two modes are independent mechanisms for RyR2 inhibition, both having a cytoplasmic site of action. The slow mode is a closed-channel block, whereas the fast mode blocks RyR2 in the open state. At diastolic cytoplasmic [Ca(2+)] (100 nM), flecainide possesses an additional inhibitory mechanism that reduces RyR2 burst duration. Hence, multiple modes of action underlie RyR2 inhibition by flecainide.",

        "abstract": "Estramustine phosphate is used frequently, alone or in combination with other antitumor agents, for the treatment of hormone-refractory prostate cancer. Estramustine phosphate is metabolically activated in vivo, and its metabolites, estramustine, estromustine, estrone, and beta-estradiol inhibit the assembly of microtubules [for review see: Kreis W, In: Concepts, Mechanisms, and New Targets for Chemotherapy (Ed. Muggia FM), pp. 163-184. Kluwer Academic Publishers, Boston, 1995]. We investigated, by displacement of [3H]methyltrienolone in the presence of 2.5 mM of triamcinolone acetonide, the binding of estramustine phosphate and its metabolites, estramustine, estromustine, estrone, and beta-estradiol, as well as other antiandrogen agents including alpha-estradiol, bicalutamide, and hydroxyflutamide, to the mutated androgen receptor (m-AR) in LNCaP cells and to the wild-type androgen receptor in wild-type AR cDNA expression plasmid (w-pAR0) cDNA-transfected HeLa cells. Analogous to the antiandrogens, bicalutamide and hydroxyflutamide, binding of estramustine phosphate metabolites to the androgen receptor was observed. The EC50 values (in microM) were: estramustine phosphate, &gt; 10; estramustine, 3.129 +/- 0.312; estromustine; 2.612 +/- 0.584; estrone, 0.800 +/- 0.090; alpha-estradiol, 1.051 +/- 0.096; beta-estradiol, 0.523 +/- 0.028; bicalutamide, 4.920 +/- 0.361; and hydroxyflutamide, 0.254 +/- 0.012. The transactivation assay demonstrated that, analogous to bicalutamide, estramustine could not induce luciferase activity in either w-pAR0 or m-pARL transfected HeLa cells. In contrast, a strong induction of the reporter activity by dihydrotestosterone was observed. Down-regulation of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) expression, an AR-target gene, by estramustine and bicalutamide was accompanied by the blockade of the mutated androgen receptor. Exposure of LNCaP cells to estramustine for 24 hr caused transcriptional inhibition of PSA in a concentration-dependent manner. The levels of PSA mRNA decreased 56 and 90% when LNCaP cells were treated with 5 and 10 microM of estramustine, respectively (IC50 = 10.97 +/- 1.68 microM). Binding of hydroxyflutamide to m-AR in LNCaP cells resulted in a concentration-dependent stimulation of PSA expression, suggesting that hydroxyflutamide acted as an agonist of the m-AR. Our data indicate that estramustine phosphate metabolites perform as androgen antagonists of AR, an additional mechanism involved in the therapeutic effect of estramustine phosphate in patients with prostate cancer.",

        "abstract": "Steady state patterns of inhibition of purified human erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase by three inhibitors were analyzed. Edrophonium acted essentially as a competitive inhibitor, whereas tacrine and ambenonium gave mixed competitive and uncompetitive inhibition with acetylthiocholine as substrate. Inhibition constants for the competitive components were 470 microM for edrophonium, 65 microM for tacrine, and 0.12 nM for ambenonium. The extremely high affinity of ambenonium permitted analysis of the rates of approach to steady state inhibition. These rates were characterized by a single exponential time course with rate constants, kexp, that showed a linear dependence when plotted against ambenonium concentration, at fixed substrate concentration. The intercepts of these plots were independent of the substrate concentration and indicated an ambenonium dissociation rate constant of 0.013 +/- 0.002 sec-1. The slope of the plot at the lowest substrate concentration approximated the ambenonium bimolecular or association rate constant and gave a value of 5.2 +/- 0.6 x 10(7) M-1 sec-1. Three models were examined to account for the nearly linear dependence of the slopes of these plots on the substrate concentration. These models indicated that ambenonium and acetylthiocholine competed for a peripheral anionic site in the acetyl-enzyme intermediate formed during substrate hydrolysis. The apparent equilibrium dissociation constant of acetylthiocholine for this peripheral site (1.2-1.4 mM) was significantly different from that calculated from substrate inhibition data (20.1 +/- 2.8 mM). We propose that acetylthiocholine can interact with the acetyl-enzyme both at the peripheral site and at the active site but that only the latter interaction inhibits substrate hydrolysis.",

        "abstract": "The aim of this study was to investigate the role of the inhibitors of different PDE isoenzymes (PDE 1-5) on the production of two pro-inflammatory cytokines - tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Two in vitro models were used to compare the antiinflammatory properties of PDE inhibitors with that of glucocorticoids. The effect on TNF release from diluted human blood following lipopolysaccharide (LPS from Salmonella abortus equi) stimulation as well as the GM-CSF and TNF release from human nasal polyp cells following allergic stimulation were investigated. Both models proofed to be well suited for the characterisation of the antiinflammatory properties of new chemical entities. In diluted human blood and dispersed human nasal polyp cells the induced TNF release was most potently suppressed by selective PDE4 inhibitors. Amrinone and milrinone, selective PDE3 inhibitors, suppressed TNF secretion to a lesser extent. The effects of theophylline (unspecific PDE inhibitor), vinpocetine (PDE1 inhibitor), EHNA (PDE2 inhibitor) and the PDE5 inhibitors zaprinast and E 4021 were weak. In human blood, the tested glucocorticoids beclomethasone, dexamethasone and fluticasone inhibited the LPS induced TNF release potently in a concentration dependent manner, whereas in dispersed human nasal polyp cells, the effect of the glucocorticoids on allergically induced TNF release, with the exception of dexamethasone, was much less pronounced. Glucocorticoids were the most potent inhibitors of GM-CSF release and the effect correlates well with the affinity to the glucocorticoid receptor. The selective PDE 4 inhibitors, and to a certain extent the PDE3 inhibitors amrinone and milrinone, reduced the GM-CSF release in a concentration dependent manner. In all investigations selective PDE4 inhibitors reduced TNF release to a much higher degree (4-10 fold) than GM-CSF release.",

Type 2 methionine aminopeptidase (MetAP2) protein is likely a molecular target of angiogenesis inhibitors. METHODS: Nitroxoline, an antibiotic used to treat urinary tract infections, was identified from a high-throughput screen of a library of 175,000 compounds for MetAP2 inhibitors and from a parallel screen using the Johns Hopkins Drug Library to identify currently used clinical drugs that can also inhibit human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC) proliferation. To investigate the mechanism of action of nitroxoline, inhibition of MetAP2 activity and induction of senescence were assessed in HUVEC. To test the antiangiogenic activity of nitroxoline, endothelial tube formation in Matrigel and microvessel formation in Matrigel plugs in vivo were assessed. Antitumor efficacy of nitroxoline was evaluated in mouse models of human breast cancer xenograft (n = 10) and bladder cancer orthotopic xenograft (n = 11). Furthermore, the mechanism of action of nitroxoline was investigated in vivo. RESULTS: Nitroxoline inhibited MetAP2 activity in vitro (half maximal inhibitory concentration [IC(50)] = 54.8 nM, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 22.6 to 132.8 nM) and HUVEC proliferation (IC(50) = 1.9 muM, 95% CI = 1.54 to 2.39 muM). Nitroxoline inhibited MetAP2 activity in HUVEC in a dose-dependent manner and induced premature senescence in a biphasic manner. Nitroxoline inhibited endothelial tube formation in Matrigel and reduced microvessel density in vivo. Mice (five per group) treated with nitroxoline showed a 60% reduction in tumor volume in breast cancer xenografts (tumor volume on day 30, vehicle vs nitroxoline, mean = 215.4 vs 86.5 mm(3), difference = 128.9 mm(3), 95% CI = 32.9 to 225.0 mm(3), P = .012) and statistically significantly inhibited growth of bladder cancer in an orthotopic mouse model (tumor bioluminescence intensities of vehicle [n = 5] vs nitroxoline [n = 6], P = .045).

        "abstract": "Aprindine, an antiarrhythmic agent with structural similarities to lidocaine and procainamide, has proved effective in treatment of patients with ventricular premature depolarizations, ventricular tachycardia, and supraventricular arrhythmias. While its effects at an electrophysiologic level have been elucidated, its mechanism of action at a biochemical level has remained largely undefined. The data in this communication demonstrate that aprindine inhibits the activation of bovine brain cyclic 3':5'-nucleotide phosphodiesterase (EC 3.1.4.17) by calmodulin. This inhibition is specific for the calmodulin-stimulated enzyme, as no effect of aprindine is seen when phosphodiesterase is assayed in the absence of calmodulin. The inhibition is competitive with respect to substrate (cyclic AMP) and calmodulin concentrations. In the presence of 10 nM calmodulin, the ID50 for aprindine is 18 microM. This inhibition is not the result of aprindine acting as a calcium chelator because increasing the calcium concentration does not reverse the inhibitory effect. Aprindine also inhibits calmodulin-stimulated Ca-ATPase (ATP phosphohydrolase EC 3.6.1.3) activity, but again has no effect on the enzyme in the absence of calmodulin. Aprindine has hydrophobic properties which may be responsible for the inhibitory effect. Sufficient concentrations of aprindine are achieved in myocardial tissues to interfere with the ability of calmodulin to stimulate a number of enzymes present in the heart.",

The pressure-natriuresis and -diuresis relationships in response to chronic angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition and AT1 receptor blockade were evaluated. Renal renin-angiotensin and nitric oxide (NO) system gene expression was also investigated. Six-week-old dTGR were treated for 3 wk with submaximal doses of cilazapril (10 mg/kg, orally) or losartan (10 mg/kg, orally) or with the drug combination. In untreated dTGR, pressure-natriuresis relationships were maximally shifted rightward by approximately 70 to 80 mmHg, and both renal blood flow (RBF) and GFR were markedly decreased. Submaximal cilazapril and losartan dosages both decreased systolic BP by 30 mmHg and shifted the pressure-natriuresis curves leftward by 25 to 30 mmHg. Cilazapril increased RBF and GFR to values observed in normotensive control animals but did not significantly affect fractional sodium excretion (FENa) or fractional water excretion (FEH2O) curves. In contrast, losartan had no significant effect on RBF or GFR but shifted the FENa and FEH2O curves leftward. The cilazapril and losartan combination completely normalized BP and shifted the pressure-natriuresis curves leftward more than did either drug alone. When cilazapril and losartan were administered at higher doses (30 mg/kg, orally), the two drugs equally shifted the pressure-natriuresis curves leftward, by 50 mmHg. Both drugs increased RBF and GFR; however, only losartan shifted FENa and FEH2O curves leftward. Human and rat renin and angiotensinogen genes were downregulated in dTGR and were increased by losartan and cilazapril treatments, whereas no changes in the expression of rat ACE and AT1A receptor genes were observed. Endothelial NO synthase expression was increased by cilazapril but not by losartan. Neither inducible NO synthase nor neural NO synthase gene expression was affected by drug treatments. Therefore, submaximal ACE inhibition enhanced sodium excretion mainly by increasing RBF and GFR, whereas submaximal AT1 receptor blockade decreased tubular sodium and water reabsorption. The combination of the two drugs produced an additive effect. The ACE inhibitor effects may involve increased endothelial NO synthase expression, perhaps related to the inhibition of bradykinin degradation.",

The mechanism of action of these drugs consists in inhibition of CA isozymes present in ciliary processes of the eye, with the consequent reduction of bicarbonate and aqueous humour secretion, and of elevated intraocular pressure (IOP) characteristic of this disease. As isoforms CA II/IV/XII are present in many other tissues/organs, generally, systemic CAIs possess undesired side effects such as numbness and tingling of extremities; metallic taste; depression; fatigue; malaise; weight loss; decreased libido; gastrointestinal irritation; metabolic acidosis; renal calculi and transient myopia. For avoiding these side effects, recently, topically effective CAIs have been developed in the last 10 years, with two drugs available clinically: dorzolamide and brinzolamide. Both these drugs are applied topically as water solutions/suspensions, alone or in combination with other agents (beta-blockers, prostaglandin derivatives, etc) and produce a consistent and prolonged reduction of IOP. Furthermore, recent reports show both the systemically as well as topically acting sulfonamide CAIs to be effective in the treatment of macular edema, macular degeneration disease, or diabetic retinopathy, for which pharmacological treatment is unavailable up to now. Much research is in act in the search of more effective topically acting CAIs, free of the inconveniences and side effects of the presently available drugs. For achieving this goal, two recently reported strategy, the tail approach and its variant, the sugar-tail approach, were extensively applied for the synthesis of large numbers of derivatives possessing desired physico-chemical properties. Many such new sulfonamides showed promising antiglaucoma activity in animal models of the disease.",

        "abstract": "The potential interaction of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors with cholinergic receptors may play a significant role in the therapeutic and/or side-effects associated with this class of compound. In the present study, the capacity of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors to interact with muscarinic receptors was assessed by their ability to displace both [3H]-oxotremorine-M and [3H]-quinuclinidyl benzilate binding in rat brain membranes. The [3H]-quinuclinidyl benzilate/[3H]-oxotremorine-M affinity ratios permitted predictions to be made of either the antagonist or agonist properties of the different compounds. A series of compounds, representative of the principal classes of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, displaced [3H]-oxotremorine-M binding with high-to-moderate potency (ambenonium&gt;neostigmine=pyridostigmine=tacrine&gt;physostigmine&gt; edrophonium=galanthamine&gt;desoxypeganine) whereas only ambenonium and tacrine displaced [3H]-quinuclinidyl benzilate binding. Inhibitors such as desoxypeganine, parathion and gramine demonstrated negligible inhibition of the binding of both radioligands. Scatchard plots constructed from the inhibition of [3H]-oxotremorine-M binding in the absence and presence of different inhibitors showed an unaltered Bmax and a reduced affinity constant, indicative of potential competitive or allosteric mechanisms. The capacity of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, with the exception of tacrine and ambenonium, to displace bound [3H]-oxotremorine-M in preference to [3H]quinuclinidyl benzilate predicts that the former compounds could act as potential agonists at muscarinic receptors. Moreover, the rank order for potency in inhibiting acetylcholinesterase (ambenonium&gt;neostigmine=physostigmine =tacrine&gt;pyridostigmine=edrophonium=galanthamine &gt;desoxypeganine&gt;parathion&gt;gramine) indicated that the most effective inhibitors of acetylcholinesterase also displaced [3H]-oxotremorine-M to the greatest extent. The capacity of these inhibitors to displace [3H]-oxotremorine-M binding preclude their utilisation for the prevention of acetylcholine catabolism in rat brain membranes, the latter being required to estimate the binding of acetylcholine to [3H]-oxotremorine-M-labelled muscarinic receptors. However, fasciculin-2, a potent peptide inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase (IC50 24 nM), did prevent catabolism of acetylcholine in rat brain membranes with an atypical inhibition isotherm of [3H]-oxotremorine-M binding, thus permitting an estimation of the \"global affinity\" of acetylcholine (Ki 85 nM) for [3H]-oxotremorine-M-labelled muscarinic receptors in rat brain.",

        "abstract": "To investigate the nature of the arachidonic acid metabolite involved in the altered reactivity of microvessels of two-kidney, one-clip hypertensive rats and the possible contribution of this product to the elevated blood pressure levels found in two-kidney, one-clip hypertension, mesenteric arterioles either perfused in vitro or studied in vivo were used along with blood pressure determinations. The decreased response to acetylcholine observed was normalized by ridogrel, a thromboxane A2 receptor antagonist, and dazoxiben, a thromboxane A2 synthase inhibitor. The smooth muscle response to nitric oxide, tested with sodium nitroprusside, was unaltered in two-kidney, one-clip hypertensive microvessels. Neither ridogrel nor dazoxiben modified the response to this vasodilator. In contrast, the potentiated response to noradrenaline was corrected by ridogrel and dazoxiben in vitro but not in vivo. Noradrenaline and acetylcholine increased the release of thromboxane A2 from the mesenteric microvessels of two-kidney, one-clip hypertensive rats. Ridogrel and dazoxiben decreased but did not normalize the elevated blood pressure of hypertensive rats. Based on these results, we concluded that: 1) the decreased responsiveness of smooth muscle to acetylcholine resulted from an increase in thromboxane A2 formation rather than a decrease in sensitivity to nitric oxide; 2) thromboxane A2 contributes to the increased noradrenaline response in mesenteric microvessels perfused in vitro while in in vivo other blood borne vasoactive agents may also be involved since the potentiated noradrenaline response was not corrected by inhibiting thromboxane A2 synthesis or receptors; 3) in addition to thromboxane A2, another as yet unidentified factor, may contribute to the elevated blood pressure in two-kidney, one-clip hypertension.",

        "abstract": "Hydrolysis of acetylcholine catalyzed by acetylcholinesterase (AChE), one of the most efficient enzymes in nature, occurs at the base of a deep and narrow active center gorge. At the entrance of the gorge, the peripheral anionic site provides a binding locus for allosteric ligands, including substrates. To date, no structural information on substrate entry to the active center from the peripheral site of AChE or its subsequent egress has been reported. Complementary crystal structures of mouse AChE and an inactive mouse AChE mutant with a substituted catalytic serine (S203A), in various complexes with four substrates (acetylcholine, acetylthiocholine, succinyldicholine, and butyrylthiocholine), two non-hydrolyzable substrate analogues (m-(N,N,N-trimethylammonio)-trifluoroacetophenone and 4-ketoamyltrimethylammonium), and one reaction product (choline) were solved in the 2.05-2.65-A resolution range. These structures, supported by binding and inhibition data obtained on the same complexes, reveal the successive positions and orientations of the substrates bound to the peripheral site and proceeding within the gorge toward the active site, the conformations of the presumed transition state for acylation and the acyl-enzyme intermediate, and the positions and orientations of the dissociating and egressing products. Moreover, the structures of the AChE mutant in complexes with acetylthiocholine and succinyldicholine reveal additional substrate binding sites on the enzyme surface, distal to the gorge entry. Hence, we provide a comprehensive set of structural snapshots of the steps leading to the intermediates of catalysis and the potential regulation by substrate binding to various allosteric sites at the enzyme surface.",

        "title": "Drospirenone: a novel progestogen with antimineralocorticoid and antiandrogenic activity.",
        "abstract": "Drospirenone (ZK 30595; 6 beta, 7 beta, 15 beta, 16 beta-dimethylen-3-oxo-17 alpha-pregn-4-ene-21, 17-carbolactone) is a novel progestogen under clinical development. Drospirenone is characterized by an innovative pharmacodynamic profile which is very closely related to that of progesterone. Potential applications include oral contraception, hormone replacement therapy and treatment of hormonal disorders. The pharmacological properties of drospirenone were investigated in vitro by receptor binding and transactivation experiments and in vivo in appropriate animal models. In qualitative agreement with progesterone, the compound binds strongly to the progesterone and the mineralocorticoid receptor and with lower affinity to androgen and glucocorticoid receptors. There is no detectable binding to the estrogen receptor. Steroid hormone agonistic and antagonistic activities of progesterone and drospirenone were compared in transactivation experiments. Individual steroid hormone receptors were artificially expressed together with a reporter gene in appropriate cell lines. Both hormones were unable to induce any androgen receptor-mediated agonistic activity. Rather, both progesterone and drospirenone distinctly antagonized androgen-stimulated transcriptional activation. Likewise, both compounds only very weakly activated the mineralocorticoid receptor but showed potent aldosterone antagonistic activity. Drospirenone did not induce glucocorticoid receptor-driven transactivation. Progesterone was a weak agonist in this respect. Drospirenone exerts potent progestogenic and antigonadotropic activity which was studied in various animal species. It efficiently promotes the maintenance of pregnancy in ovariectomized rats, inhibits ovulation in rats and mice and stimulates endometrial transformation in the rabbit. Furthermore, drospirenone shows potent antigonadotropic, i.e., testosterone-lowering activity in male cynomolgus monkeys. The progestogenic potency of drospirenone was found to be in the range of that of norethisterone acetate. The majority of clinically used progestogens are androgenic. Drospirenone, like progesterone, has no androgenic but rather an antiandrogenic effect. This property was demonstrated in castrated, testosterone propionate substituted male rats by a dose-dependent inhibition of accessory sex organ growth (seminal vesicles, prostate). In this model, the potency of drospirenone was about a third that of cyproterone acetate. Drospirenone, like progesterone, shows antimineralocorticoid activity, which causes moderately increased sodium and water excretion. This is an outstanding characteristic which has not been described for any other synthetic progestogen before. Drospirenone is eight to ten times more effective in this respect than spironolactone. The natriuretic effect was demonstrable for at least three weeks upon daily treatment of rats with a dose of 10 mg/animal. Drospirenone is devoid of any estrogenic, glucocorticoid or antiglucocorticoid activity. In summary, drospirenone, like progesterone, combines potent progestogenic with antimineralocorticoid and antiandrogenic activity in a similar dose range.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

Fingolimod (FTY720), an immunosuppressant agent currently used in the treatment of multiple sclerosis, also has anticancer actions and can act as an HDACi. Here we examined whether fingolimod can inhibit human MB cell viability and survival, and if the effects are accompanied by increased histone acetylation. D283 and DAOY MB cells were treated with different doses of fingolimod. Cell viability was assessed by cell counting in a hemocytometer, and cell survival was analyzed with a colony formation assay. Histone H3 acetylation was measured with an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Fingolimod at 7.5 or 10 muM, but not at 5 muM, induced a significant reduction in cell viability in D283 and DAOY cultures, and similar results were observed for inhibition of cell survival. In both cell lines, fingolimod also led to a significant increase in the levels of acetylated H3. These findings provide preliminary evidence indicating that fingolimod induces antitumor activities in MB, possibly through a mechanism which increases H3 histone acetylation.",

RESULTS: Incubation of the enzymes with lucanthone inhibited the catalytic activity of topoisomerases II and I. With topoisomerase II, it increased the abundance of DNA double strand breaks (cleavable complexes). CONCLUSION: Lucanthone, like actinomycin D, inhibited topoisomerases II and I.

        "abstract": "We previously suggested that therapeutic effects of betahistine in vestibular disorders result from its antagonist properties at histamine H(3) receptors (H(3)Rs). However, H(3)Rs exhibit constitutive activity, and most H(3)R antagonists act as inverse agonists. Here, we have investigated the effects of betahistine at recombinant H(3)R isoforms. On inhibition of cAMP formation and [(3)H]arachidonic acid release, betahistine behaved as a nanomolar inverse agonist and a micromolar agonist. Both effects were suppressed by pertussis toxin, were found at all isoforms tested, and were not detected in mock cells, confirming interactions at H(3)Rs. The inverse agonist potency of betahistine and its affinity on [(125)I]iodoproxyfan binding were similar in rat and human. We then investigated the effects of betahistine on histamine neuron activity by measuring tele-methylhistamine (t-MeHA) levels in the brains of mice. Its acute intraperitoneal administration increased t-MeHA levels with an ED(50) of 0.4 mg/kg, indicating inverse agonism. At higher doses, t-MeHA levels gradually returned to basal levels, a profile probably resulting from agonism. After acute oral administration, betahistine increased t-MeHA levels with an ED(50) of 2 mg/kg, a rightward shift probably caused by almost complete first-pass metabolism. In each case, the maximal effect of betahistine was lower than that of ciproxifan, indicating partial inverse agonism. After an oral 8-day treatment, the only effective dose of betahistine was 30 mg/kg, indicating that a tolerance had developed. These data strongly suggest that therapeutic effects of betahistine result from an enhancement of histamine neuron activity induced by inverse agonism at H(3) autoreceptors.",

        "abstract": "Tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) have been reported to interact with the opioid system, but their pharmacological activity at opioid receptors has not yet been elucidated. In the present study, we investigated the actions of amoxapine, amitriptyline, nortriptyline, desipramine, and imipramine at distinct cloned and native opioid receptors. In Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells expressing delta-opioid receptors (CHO/DOR), TCAs displaced [3H]naltrindole binding and stimulated guanosine 5'-O-(3-[(35)S]thio)triphosphate ([(35)S]GTPgammaS) binding at micromolar concentrations with amoxapine displaying the highest potency and efficacy. Amoxapine and amitriptyline inhibited cyclic AMP formation and induced the phosphorylation of signaling molecules along the extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) and phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase pathways. Amoxapine also activated delta-opioid receptors in rat dorsal striatum and nucleus accumbens and human frontal cortex. In CHO cells expressing kappa-opioid receptors (CHO/KOR), TCAs, but not amoxapine, exhibited higher receptor affinity and more potent stimulation of [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding than in CHO/DOR and effectively inhibited cyclic AMP accumulation. Amitriptyline regulated ERK1/2 phosphorylation and activity in CHO/KOR and C6 glioma cells endogenously expressing kappa-opioid receptors, and this effect was attenuated by the kappa-opioid antagonist nor-binaltorphimine. In rat nucleus accumbens, amitriptyline slightly inhibited adenylyl cyclase activity and counteracted the inhibitory effect of the full kappa agonist trans-(-)-3,4dichloro-N-methyl-N-[2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)cyclohexyl]benzeneacetamide (U50,488). At the cloned mu-opioid receptor, TCAs showed low affinity and no significant agonist activity. These results show that TCAs differentially regulate opioid receptors with a preferential agonist activity on either delta or kappa subtypes and suggest that this property may contribute to their therapeutic and/or side effects.",

Using the TEM-1 enzyme, we characterized avibactam inhibition by measuring the on-rate for acylation and the off-rate for deacylation. The deacylation off-rate was 0.045 min(-1), which allowed investigation of the deacylation route from TEM-1. Using NMR and MS, we showed that deacylation proceeds through regeneration of intact avibactam and not hydrolysis. Other than TEM-1, four additional clinically relevant beta-lactamases were shown to release intact avibactam after being acylated.

Inhibitors of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) have proven to be successful treatments for hypertension. As renin specifically catalyses the rate-limiting step of the RAS, it represents the optimal target for RAS inhibition. Several peptide-like renin inhibitors have been synthesized previously, but poor pharmacokinetic properties meant that these compounds were not clinically useful. We employed a combination of molecular modelling and crystallographic structure analysis to design renin inhibitors lacking the extended peptide-like backbone of earlier inhibitors, for improved pharmacokinetic properties. This led to the discovery of aliskiren, a highly potent and selective inhibitor of human renin in vitro, and in vivo; once-daily oral doses of aliskiren inhibit renin and lower blood pressure in sodium-depleted marmosets and hypertensive human patients.

        "title": "Therapeutic potential of vasopressin receptor antagonists.",
        "abstract": "Arginine vasopressin (AVP) is a neuropeptide hormone that plays an important role in circulatory and sodium homeostasis, and regulating serum osmolality. Several clinical conditions have been associated with inappropriately elevated levels of AVP including heart failure, cirrhosis of the liver and the syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone. Three receptor subtypes that mediate the actions of AVP have been identified (V(1A), V(2) and V(1B)). Activation of V(1A) receptors located in vascular smooth muscle cells and the myocardium results in vasoconstriction and increased afterload and hypertrophy. The V(2) receptors located primarily in the collecting tubules mediate free water absorption. The V(1B) receptors are located in the anterior pituitary and mediate adrenocorticotropin hormone release. The cardiovascular and renal effects of AVP are mediated primarily by V(1A) and V(2) receptors. Antagonism of V(1A) receptors results in vasodilatation and antagonism of V(2) receptors resulting in aquaresis, an electrolyte-sparing water excretion. Several non-peptide AVP antagonists (vasopressin receptor antagonists [VRAs]) also termed 'vaptans' have been developed and are vigorously being studied primarily for treating conditions characterised by hyponatraemia and fluid overload. Conivaptan is a combined V(1A)/V(2)-receptor antagonist that induces diuresis as well as haemodynamic improvement. It has been shown in clinical trials to correct euvolaemic and hypervolaemic hyponatraemia, and has been approved by the US FDA for the treatment of euvolaemic hyponatraemia as an intravenous infusion. Tolvaptan, a selective V(2)-receptor antagonist, has undergone extensive clinical studies in the treatment of hyponatraemia and heart failure. It has been shown to effectively decrease fluid in volume overloaded patients with heart failure and to correct hyponatraemia. A large outcome study (n = 4133 patients) will define its role in the management of heart failure. Lixivaptan and satavaptan (SR-121463) are other selective V(2)-receptor antagonists being evaluated for the treatment of hyponatraemia. In addition, a potential role for the vaptans in attenuating polyuria in nephrogenic diabetes insipidus and cyst development in polycystic kidney disease is being explored. Ongoing clinical trials should further define the scope of the potential therapeutic role of VRAs.",

        "abstract": "Lung cancer is still the leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Identifying new oncogenic drivers and developing efficient inhibitors through molecular targeting approaches are crucial for improving therapies. The aim of this study was to investigate whether targeting fibroblast growth factor receptor 1 (FGFR1) with ponatinib inhibits the cell growth in both established and primary lung cancer cells overexpressing FGFR1. Eighty-eight non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and paired normal tissue specimens were analyzed by real-time RT-PCR for FGFR1 gene expression. We identified four cell lines and two newly established primary lung cancer cultures that showed high FGFR1 expression levels, and evaluated the effect of the novel FGFR1 inhibitor ponatinib on cell growth. Approximately 50% (30 out of 59) NSCLC specimens expressed FGFR1&gt;2-fold compared with their adjacent normal counterparts using quantitative RT-PCR. Ponatinib treatment of established NSCLC cell lines expressing higher levels of FGFR1 resulted in marked cell growth inhibition and suppression of clonogenicity. This growth inhibition was associated with inactivation of FGFR1 and its downstream targets. FGFR1 knockdown by shRNA achieved similar results when compared to treatment with ponatinib. Furthermore, ponatinib was able to significantly inhibit the growth of primary lung cancer cultures in vitro. Our data indicate that pharmacological inhibition of FGFR1 kinase activity with ponatinib may be effective for the treatment of lung cancer patients whose tumors overexpress FGFR1.",

Randomized, placebo-controlled trials have demonstrated a significant improvement in exercise capacity and decrease in time to clinical worsening, along with evidence to support an improvement in WHO functional class and quality of life for patients receiving ambrisentan. Long-term data have shown a 1-year survival of 95%; of the survivors, 94% remained on ambrisentan monotherapy.

        "abstract": "This review focuses on the mechanisms of action of histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors (HDACi), a group of recently discovered 'targeted' anticancer agents. There are 18 HDACs, which are generally divided into four classes, based on sequence homology to yeast counterparts. Classical HDACi such as the hydroxamic acid-based vorinostat (also known as SAHA and Zolinza) inhibits classes I, II and IV, but not the NAD+-dependent class III enzymes. In clinical trials, vorinostat has activity against hematologic and solid cancers at doses well tolerated by patients. In addition to histones, HDACs have many other protein substrates involved in regulation of gene expression, cell proliferation and cell death. Inhibition of HDACs causes accumulation of acetylated forms of these proteins, altering their function. Thus, HDACs are more properly called 'lysine deacetylases.' HDACi induces different phenotypes in various transformed cells, including growth arrest, activation of the extrinsic and/or intrinsic apoptotic pathways, autophagic cell death, reactive oxygen species (ROS)-induced cell death, mitotic cell death and senescence. In comparison, normal cells are relatively more resistant to HDACi-induced cell death. The plurality of mechanisms of HDACi-induced cell death reflects both the multiple substrates of HDACs and the heterogeneous patterns of molecular alterations present in different cancer cells.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Dolutegravir (DTG, S/GSK1349572) is an integrase inhibitor with low nanomolar potency. Susceptibility to dolutegravir and raltegravir was determined for raltegravir-resistant clinical isolates. METHODS: Genotypic and phenotypic susceptibility to integrase inhibitors was examined using 39 clinical isolate samples obtained from 18 adults who had exhibited incomplete viral suppression on a raltegravir-based regimen. RESULTS: Of 39 samples evaluated, 30 had genotypic and phenotypic resistance to raltegravir. All samples lacking raltegravir resistance retained complete susceptibility to dolutegravir. Of the 30 samples with genotypic evidence of raltegravir resistance, the median level of phenotypic resistance to raltegravir was high (median fold change in inhibitory concentration at 50%, &gt;81; range, 3.7 to &gt;87), while the level of resistance to dolutegravir was close to that of wild-type variants (median fold change, 1.5; range, 0.9-19.0). Longitudinal samples from 5 subjects collected during long-term failure of raltegravir revealed time-dependent general decreases in phenotypic susceptibility to raltegravir, with minimal changes in phenotypic susceptibility to dolutegravir. The median fold change to dolutegravir for isolates containing changes at G140S + Q148H, G140S + Q148R, T97A + Y143R, and N155H (thus including raltegravir signature resistance codons) were 3.75, 13.3, 1.05, and 1.37, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Dolutegravir retained in vitro activity against clinical isolates obtained from subjects who failed raltegravir-based therapy at near wild-type levels for variants containing the Y143 and N155 resistance mutations. Isolates with Q148 plus additional integrase mutations possessed a broader range of and more reduced susceptibility to dolutegravir.",

        "abstract": "Hyaluronan is overproduced in many diseases including metastasis, inflammation or ischemia, but there is no drug to attenuate hyaluronan production. Hyaluronan is exported from fibroblasts by the multidrug resistance associated protein 5 (MRP5) which is inhibited by the plant phenols curcumin or xanthohumol. We performed virtual docking and chemical synthesis of analogues to optimize the inhibitors. The AutoDock software was used to identify the binding cavity within the open conformation of MRP5. Inhibitory plant phenols bound to the ATP binding site between the two nucleotide binding domains NBD1 and NBD2. This binding cavity was chosen to screen about 120 derivatives and analogues. The superior hyaluronan export inhibitor was 1,5-bis(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)-1,4-pentadien-3-one (hylin). It inhibited hyaluronan export from fibroblasts with an IC50 of 4.9 muM. Hylin is a minor component in natural curcumin preparations and has previously been described as anti-metastatic and anti-inflammatory. Since curcumin itself is unstable under physiological conditions, the active component for many cell biological and pharmaceutical effects of natural curcumin preparations could be hylin that acts by hyaluronan export inhibition.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Adenosine is a major endogenous regulator of macrophage function, and activates four specific adenosine receptors (A(1), A(2A), A(2B) and A(3)). Here, we have assessed in human lung macrophages the modulation of the expression of adenosine receptor mRNA by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and the relative contributions of the different adenosine receptors to LPS-induced production of tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and chemokines. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Lung macrophages isolated from resected lungs were stimulated with LPS and treated with adenosine receptor agonists or/and antagonists. Adenosine receptor expression was assessed with qRT-PCR. Cytokines were measured in lung macrophage supernatants with elisa. KEY RESULTS: LPS increased (about 400-fold) mRNA for A(2A) adenosine receptors, decreased mRNA for A(1) and A(2B), but had no effect on A(3) adenosine receptor mRNA. The adenosine receptor agonist NECA inhibited TNF-alpha production concentration dependently, whereas the A(1) receptor agonist, CCPA, and the A(3) receptor agonist, AB-MECA, inhibited TNF-alpha production only at concentrations affecting A(2A) receptors. NECA also inhibited the production of CCL chemokines (CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL5) and CXCL chemokines (CXCL9 and CXCL10), but not that of CXCL1, CXCL8 and CXCL5. Reversal of NECA-induced inhibition of TNF-alpha and chemokine production by the selective A(2A) adenosine receptor antagonist ZM 241385, but not the A(2B) receptor antagonist, MRS 1754, or the A(3) receptor antagonist, MRS 1220, indicated involvement of A(2A) receptors. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: LPS up-regulated A(2A) adenosine receptor gene transcription, and this receptor subtype mediated inhibition of the LPS-induced production of TNF-alpha and of a subset of chemokines in human lung macrophages.",

DATA SOURCES: PubMed articles indexed through August 2013 were identified using the search terms S/GSK1349572, dolutegravir, and integrase inhibitor. Information was also identified from the package insert, cited publication references, professional meeting abstracts, and the ClinicalTrials.gov registry. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: English language articleswere selected for evaluation, with preference given to safety, efficacy, and pharmacokinetic studies conducted in HIV-1-infected patients. DATA SYNTHESIS: Dolutegravir is a new INSTI approved for combination treatment in HIV-1-infected adults and adolescent children. Four phase 3 studies provide the basis for current labeling in antiretroviral-naive and antiretroviral-experienced adults. Results from these studies demonstrate that dolutegravir is noninferior in efficacy to raltegravir in antiretroviral-naive patients and superior in antiretroviral-experienced patients. Superiority to efavirenz and darunavir/ritonavir was also demonstrated in antiretroviral-naive patients. Dolutegravir is well tolerated, exhibits low potential for drug-drug interactions, and has a long serum half-life, allowing it to be administered once-daily in patients without preexisting INSTI resistance. Twice-daily administration is recommended in patients with known or suspected resistance mutations to first-generation INSTIs. Mild elevations in serum creatinine occur following dolutegravir initiation from inhibition of renal organic cation transporter 2 but do not reflect changes in glomerular filtration. CONCLUSIONS: Dolutegravir is the first second-generation INSTI and exhibits several advantages over current integrase inhibitors and other preferred antiretrovirals. Long-term efficacy and safety are needed to define dolutegravir's role in treatment.",

This has been proposed as the basis of its anticoagulant activity. We investigated the reaction of Nafamostat with bovine pancreatic trypsin as a model system. It was shown to act as a time-dependent competitive inhibitor, and the inhibition constants for the binding of Nafamostat to trypsin (i.e., Ki) and the overall inhibition constants (i.e., Ki*) were calculated to be 11.5 microM and 0.4+/-0.14 nM, respectively. The second-order rate constant for the reaction was 4.5+/-0.19x10(5) M(-1)s(-1), and the product released following the acylation step, 6-amidino2-naphthol, showed mixed-type inhibition. The competitive (Kic) and uncompetitive (Kiu) inhibition constants were 14.7 microM and 19.5 microM, respectively. Formation of the acyl-enzyme intermediate was dissected into at least two steps, with rates of 0.9 s(-1) and 195 s(-1). The deacylation step was relatively much slower (3.2+/-0.19x10(-5) s(-1), enabling the mass spectroscopic analysis of the acyl-enzyme intermediate, which confirmed the covalent attachment of 4-guanidinobenzoic acid to trypsin. The product of the deacylation step, 4-guanidinobenzoic acid, showed no inhibition up to a concentration of 200 microM. These data strongly suggest that while Nafamostat is a potent inhibitor of trypsin, it is actually an extremely poor substrate, and that apparent inhibition is due to the competitive formation of a very stable acyl-enzyme intermediate, analogous to some other active site titrants.",

The flow cytometric assay showed that the ann-II expression rate was higher in the human umbilical vein endothelial cell (HUVEC) (87.65%) than in the HL-60 cells as controls (35.79%). Two irrelevant proteins, bovine serum albumin (BSA) and equine IgG (EIG) had no effect on the production of plasmin. Ann-II-mediated enhancement of t-PA-dependent PLG activation was inhibited by epsilon-aminocaproic acid or by pretreatment of Ann-II with carboxypeptidase B with the inhibitive rate being 77.8% and 77.0%, respectively. It was revealed that the effect of Ann-II on PLG activation was specific for t-PA. Urokinase didn't bind to Ann-II, demonstrating the role of receptor-related lysine residues on activation of PLG, showing that the Ann-II-PLG interaction was dependent upon carboxyl-terminal lysine residues. These findings suggest that annexin II-mediated co-assembly of t-PA and PLG may promote plasmin generation and play a key role in modulating fibrinolysis on the endothelial surface.",

The binding of plasminogen to leukocytic cell lines induces a 30- to 80-fold increase in the rate of plasminogen activation by tissue-type (tPA) and urokinase-type (uPA) plasminogen activators. In the present study we have examined the role of alpha-enolase in plasminogen activation on the cell surface. We produced and characterized a monoclonal antibody (MAb) 11G1 against purified alpha-enolase, which abrogated about 90% of cell-dependent plasminogen activation by either uPA or tPA on leukocytoid cell lines of different lineages: B-lymphocytic, T-lymphocytic, granulocytic, and monocytic cells. In addition, MAb 11G1 also blocked enhancement of plasmin formation by peripheral blood neutrophils and monocytes. In contrast, MAb 11G1 did not affect plasmin generation in the presence of fibrin, indicating that this antibody did not interact with fibrinolytic components in the absence of cells. These data suggest that, although leukocytic cells display several molecules that bind plasminogen, alpha-enolase is responsible for the majority of the promotion of plasminogen activation on the surfaces of leukocytic cells.",

        "abstract": "Novel therapeutic strategies for type 2 diabetes are needed, since the current treatment options neither address all pathophysiological mechanisms nor achieve the glycemic target goals. A general islet-cell dysfunction including insulin- and glucagon-secretion defects contributes to the pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes. Improving islet function by incretin hormone action is a novel therapeutic approach. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) are important incretin hormones contributing to 50-70% of the stimulation of insulin secretion after a meal. Dipeptidyl-peptidase IV (DPP-4) inhibitors inhibit the degradation of GLP-1 and GIP as well as that of other regulatory peptides. Sitagliptin, a DPP-4 inhibitor, is orally active and has been shown to be efficacious and safe in clinical studies. Sitagliptin has received approval in Mexico, the United States and other countries. Like other DPP-4 inhibitors, sitagliptin reduces hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), fasting and postprandial glucose by glucose-dependent stimulation of insulin secretion and inhibition of glucagon secretion. Sitagliptin is weight neutral. Indirect measures show a possible improvement of beta-cell function. Sitagliptin does not cause a higher rate of hypoglycemia in comparison to metformin or placebo.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Because of the adverse characteristics associated with heparin, direct antagonists of thrombin have been investigated as anticoagulants during percutaneous coronary interventions. However, the hematologic and clinical interactions between direct thrombin antagonists and inhibitors of platelet glycoprotein IIb-IIIa are incompletely explored. METHODS: Forty-two patients who underwent elective percutaneous coronary intervention were randomized to receive a bivalirudin 1.0 mg/kg bolus followed by a 4-hour infusion at 2.5 mg/kg/h; a bivalirudin 0.75 mg/kg bolus followed by a 4-hour infusion at 1.75 mg/kg; or a heparin 60 U/kg bolus. All the patients also received eptifibatide, given as 2 sequential boluses of 180 microg/kg followed by a 2 microg/kg/min infusion for 18 to 24 hours, and aspirin. RESULTS: After the bolus dose of the study drug, turbidimetric platelet aggregation in response to 5 micromol/L adenosine diphosphate increased in patients assigned to heparin but not those assigned to bivalirudin. After eptifibatide, platelet aggregation was eliminated in all 3 treatment groups. The effect of heparin and the effects of both bivalirudin regimens on the formation of thrombin antithrombin complexes and prothrombin fragment 1.2 were comparable. Neither agent affected the formation of platelet-monocyte complexes or expression of CD 63 lysosomal antigen. There were no major bleeding events, and a single non-Q-wave myocardial infarction (MI) occurred in a patient treated with bivalirudin. CONCLUSION: These findings show the feasibility of combining the direct thrombin antagonist bivalirudin with a potent antagonist of platelet glycoprotein IIb-IIIa. Clinical trials are needed to assess the safety and efficacy of this combination.",

        "abstract": "Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been reported to reduce the risk and mortality of colorectal cancer (CRC) by inhibiting the activity of cyclooxygenase (COX). The present studies were directed to determine whether selective COX-2 inhibition reduces CRC tumour cell proliferation and invasion/migration, and the possible cellular and molecular mechanisms involved. The MC-26 cells are a highly invasive mouse CRC cell line expressing COX-2 protein. NS-398 (100 microM), a highly selective COX-2 inhibitor, decreased cell proliferation by approximately 35% of control, as determined using [(3)H]-thymidine incorporation. This reduction in cell proliferation was associated with decreased expression of cyclin D1 and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA). Furthermore, NS-398 inhibited cell invasion/migration through Matrigel extracellular matrix components at 24 h by approximately 60%. The addition of exogenous prostaglandin E(2) partially attenuated the inhibition of cell invasion by 10 microM NS-398, but failed to reverse the effect of 100 microM NS-398. Matrix metalloproteinases-2 (MMP-2) and -9 (MMP-9) are two enzymes that facilitate cell invasion/migration by degrading the extracellular matrix. In the presence of 100 microM NS-398, Western blot hybridisation analysis and zymography demonstrated that both MMP-2 and MMP-9 protein levels and enzyme activity were decreased by approximately 25-30%. In separate studies, NS-398 also inhibited tumour growth in vivo and retarded the formation of liver metastasis. The results of these studies indicate that the expression and activity of COX-2 appear to be associated with both the proliferative and invasive properties of CRC. Cyclooxygenase-2 inhibition suppresses tumour cell growth and invasion/migration, and retards liver metastasis in a mouse colon cancer model, via multiple cellular and molecular mechanisms.",

        "abstract": "The alpha-1 and alpha-2 adrenergic effects of cirazoline were evaluated in guinea-pig aorta and field-stimulated guinea-pig ileum, respectively. Cirazoline was found to be a full agonist at alpha-1 receptors having an ED50, dissociation constant (KA) and relative efficacy similar to that of (-)-norepinephrine. In contrast, cirazoline does not possess agonist activity at presynaptic alpha-2 receptors in the guinea-pig ileum. Thus, whereas norepinephrine and cirazoline both inhibited the twitch response of the field-stimulated ileum, only the response to norepinephrine was blocked by the selective alpha-2 antagonist, yohimbine. The nonadrenergic inhibition of the twitch response observed in the ileum with cirazoline resulted from weak anticholinergic activity (antimuscarinic) at the level of the postsynaptic effector organ and was observed only at high concentrations. At concentrations far below the level required to inhibit the twitch response, cirazoline was found to competitively antagonize the alpha-2-mediated inhibition of the twitch response elicited by norepinephrine. A Schild plot analysis indicated that cirazoline is a potent competitive alpha-2 receptor antagonist characterized by a pA2 value (i.e., -log KB) of 7.56. These results indicate that cirazoline is unique among imidazolines in that it is a potent alpha-1 adrenergic receptor agonist and an even more potent alpha-2 receptor antagonist. This unusual combination of activities could make cirazoline a particularly effective vasoconstricting agent.",

Minimum inhibitor concentrations (MIC) revealed that the Escherichia coli DH5 alpha transconjugate strains that possessed the OHIO-1 beta-lactamase, Met69Ile mutant of the OHIO-1 beta-lactamase, TEM-30 (Arg244Ser) and TEM-31 (Arg244Cys) beta-lactamase were most susceptible to piperacillin and piperacillin/tazobactam. Kinetic experiments with each beta-lactamase demonstrated that tazobactam was 10-25-fold more potent than clavulanate or sulbactam against TEM-30 and TEM-31 beta-lactamase. Tazobactam was also as effective as clavulanate against the Met69Ile mutant of the OHIO-1 beta-lactamase.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor has been implicated in the pathogenesis of migraine. Rimegepant is an orally administered, small-molecule, calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonist that may be effective in acute migraine treatment. METHODS: In a multicenter, double-blind, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned adults with at least a 1-year history of migraine and two to eight migraine attacks of moderate or severe intensity per month to receive rimegepant orally at a dose of 75 mg or matching placebo for the treatment of a single migraine attack. The primary end points were freedom from pain and freedom from the most bothersome symptom (other than pain) identified by the patient, both of which were assessed 2 hours after the dose of rimegepant or placebo was administered. RESULTS: A total of 1186 patients were randomly assigned to receive rimegepant (594 patients) or placebo (592 patients); of these, 537 patients in the rimegepant group and 535 patients in the placebo group could be evaluated for efficacy. The overall mean age of the patients evaluated for efficacy was 40.6 years, and 88.7% were women. In a modified intention-to-treat analysis, the percentage of patients who were pain-free 2 hours after receiving the dose was 19.6% in the rimegepant group and 12.0% in the placebo group (absolute difference, 7.6 percentage points; 95% confidence interval [CI], 3.3 to 11.9; P&lt;0.001). The percentage of patients who were free from their most bothersome symptom 2 hours after the dose was 37.6% in the rimegepant group and 25.2% in the placebo group (absolute difference, 12.4 percentage points; 95% CI, 6.9 to 17.9; P&lt;0.001). The most common adverse events were nausea and urinary tract infection. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of a migraine attack with the oral calcitonin gene-related peptide receptor antagonist rimegepant resulted in a higher percentage of patients who were free of pain and free from their most bothersome symptom than placebo.

        "abstract": "The increasing number of bacteria resistant to combinations of beta-lactam and beta-lactamase inhibitors is creating great difficulties in the treatment of serious hospital-acquired infections. Understanding the mechanisms and structural basis for the inactivation of these inhibitor-resistant beta-lactamases provides a rationale for the design of novel compounds. In the present work, SHV-1 and the Ser(130) --&gt; Gly inhibitor-resistant variant of SHV-1 beta-lactamase were inactivated with tazobactam, a potent class A beta-lactamase inhibitor. Apoenzymes and inhibited beta-lactamases were analyzed by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC-ESI/MS), digested with trypsin, and the products resolved using LC-ESI/MS and matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry. The mass increases observed for SHV-1 and Ser(130) --&gt; Gly (+ Delta 88 Da and + Delta 70 Da, respectively) suggest that fragmentation of tazobactam readily occurs in the inhibitor-resistant variant to yield an inactive beta-lactamase. These two mass increments are consistent with the formation of an aldehyde (+ Delta 70 Da) and a hydrated aldehyde (+ Delta 88 Da) as stable products of inhibition. Our results reveal that the Ser --&gt; Gly substitution at amino acid position 130 is not essential for enzyme inactivation. By examining the inhibitor-resistant Ser(130) --&gt; Gly beta-lactamase, our data are the first to show that tazobactam undergoes fragmentation while still attached to the active site Ser(70) in this enzyme. After acylation of tazobactam by Ser(130) --&gt; Gly, inactivation proceeds independent of any additional covalent interactions.",

        "abstract": "PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Hyperphosphatemia remains an important aspect in the management of end-stage renal disease patients. Consequently, there is a need for new, efficient and well-tolerated phosphate binders. In this review, a new phosphate-binding drug, lanthanum carbonate, with an attractive preclinical efficacy profile compared with existing binders, is discussed. Although the available human efficacy and safety data over 3 years are encouraging, the consequences of low-level tissue deposition continue to be evaluated in longer-term clinical studies. RECENT FINDINGS: Lanthanum carbonate has been shown in clinical studies of up to 3 years to be an effective, well-tolerated phosphate binder. Reported adverse effects are mainly gastrointestinal, and do not differ from those of calcium carbonate. The gastrointestinal absorption of lanthanum is very low. Whereas the element is mainly excreted by the liver, renal excretion of the absorbed fraction is less than 2%. Bone lanthanum levels seen after long-term treatment (up to 4 years) seem not to affect the physicochemical process of mineralization, or osteoblast number/function. Preliminary data on the localization of lanthanum in bone have shown the element to be present at both active and quiescent sites of bone mineralization, independent of the type of renal osteodystrophy, a profile distinct from aluminum, as well as diffusely distributed throughout the mineralized bone matrix especially in rats/humans with an increased bone turnover. A randomized, comparator-controlled, parallel group, open-label study comparing lanthanum carbonate with calcium carbonate in dialysis patients showed no evolution towards low bone turnover in the lanthanum group, and no aluminum-like effect on bone. SUMMARY: Lanthanum carbonate seems to be a potent phosphate-binding drug, minimally absorbed from the gut, with an encouraging safety profile, and no deleterious effects on bone.",

        "title": "Defective processing of the transforming growth factor-beta1 in azoxymethane-induced mouse colon tumors.",
        "abstract": "High levels of the cell growth inhibitor transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) are often found in a variety of human cancers. However, the physiological significance of this overexpression depends on the availability of the biologically active form of TGF-beta1 within the extracellular matrix of the tumor microenvironment. To determine the expression and activation status of TGF-beta1 in chemically induced tumors, 6-wk-old A/J mice were injected intraperitoneally with either azoxymethane (AOM) (10 mg/kg body weight, once a week for 6 wk) or normal saline solution, and colon tumors were isolated 24 wk following the last injection. An enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for TGF-beta1 revealed a significant increase (1.7-fold, P &lt; 0.05) in total TGF-beta1 protein in tumors. Interestingly, while 80% of the total TGF-beta1 in the control colon tissues was in the active form, only 50% was found to be active in tumors. Together with our earlier observations that TGF-beta1 mRNA levels are unchanged in A/J tumors, these data further support a mechanism whereby elevated TGF-beta1 levels result from a defective activation and turnover of this protein. Because plasmin is known to be a major activator of TGF-beta1 in vivo, we hypothesized that reduced plasmin activity may be responsible for the observed dysregulation of TGF-beta1 processing in these behaviorally benign tumors. With a fluorogenic peptide substrate for serine proteases, a deficiency in plasmin activity was found in the tumors. Furthermore, semiquantitative reverse transcription (RT)-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of a panel of genes involved in the plasminogen activation system, including plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1), urokinase-plasminogen activator (u-PA), and urokinase-receptor (u-PAR-1), demonstrated a significant upregulation (approximately fourfold to sixfold, P &lt; 0.05) in the expression of each of these genes in the tumor tissue. In addition, no significant changes were observed in the expression levels of thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) and insulin-like growth factor type II receptor (IGF-IIR), which also mediate the activation of latent TGF-beta1. To gain further insight into the functionality of the TGF-beta1 pathway, cDNA microarrays were performed and the expression levels of a panel of 21 TGF-beta1-specific target genes were determined in AOM-induced tumors that overexpress the ligand. A significant dysregulation in the expression of each of these targets was observed, providing evidence of aberrant TGF-beta1 signaling in tumors. Overall, the present study demonstrates a very low plasmin activity in A/J colon tumors, possibly as a result of the potent inhibitory effect of PAI-1 on the plasminogen activation cascade. The observed deficiency in plasmin activity may not be sufficiently compensated for by other mechanisms of latent TGF-beta1 activation, including TSP-1 and IGF-IIR, thereby resulting in a decreased fraction of the biologically active form of TGF-beta1 and subsequent aberration in TGF-beta1-specific gene regulation in A/J tumors.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, safety, and efficacy of sitagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitor in the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus. DATA SOURCES: A MEDLINE search (1966-February 2006) was conducted for English-language articles using the terms dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor, incretin, MK-0431, and sitagliptin. Abstracts from the American Diabetes Association annual meetings in 2004 and 2005 were included as sources of data. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Articles pertaining to the pharmacology of sitagliptin, its pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy were reviewed. DATA SYNTHESIS: Sitagliptin is a potent, competitive, reversible inhibitor of the DPP-IV enzyme. It is eliminated renally, with a terminal half-life of 11.8-14.4 hours. In Phase II clinical trials, sitagliptin was found to be superior to placebo for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Results of a small trial comparing sitagliptin with glipizide indicate that both treatments are comparable. The efficacy of sitagliptin has also been demonstrated when used as adjunctive therapy with metformin. Few adverse effects have been reported. Weight gain and hypoglycemia have not been seen with sitagliptin therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Based on its unique mechanism of action, sitagliptin will provide practitioners with an additional tool in the treatment of diabetes. Review of the literature to date implies sitagliptin may be effective as monotherapy in type 2 diabetes. In addition, existing evidence supports the use of sitagliptin as adjunct therapy to sulfonylureas and metformin. Another advantage of sitagliptin use is that it appears to be free from the adverse effects of weight gain and hypoglycemia that are associated with currently available treatments.",

        "title": "Rivastigmine for Alzheimer's disease.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is the commonest cause of dementia affecting older people. One of the therapeutic strategies aimed at ameliorating the clinical manifestations of Alzheimer's disease is to enhance cholinergic neurotransmission in relevant parts of the brain by the use of cholinesterase inhibitors to delay the breakdown of acetylcholine released into synaptic clefts. Tacrine, the first of the cholinesterase inhibitors to undergo extensive trials for this purpose, was associated with significant adverse effects including hepatotoxicity. Other cholinesterase inhibitors, including rivastigmine, with superior properties in terms of specificity of action and low risk of adverse effects, have now been introduced. Rivastigmine has received approval for use in 60 countries including all member states of the European Union and the USA. OBJECTIVES: To determine the clinical efficacy and safety of rivastigmine for patients with dementia of Alzheimer's type. SEARCH STRATEGY: The Specialized Register of the Cochrane Dementia and Cognitive Improvement Group (CDCIG), The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL and LILACS were searched on 27 March 2008 using the terms: Rivastigmine OR exelon OR ENA OR \"SDZ ENA 713\" . The CDCIG Specialized Register contains records from all major health care databases (The Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, LILACS) as well as from many clinical trials registries and grey literature sources. SELECTION CRITERIA: All unconfounded, double-blind, randomized trials in which treatment with rivastigmine was administered to patients with dementia of the Alzheimer's type for more than two weeks and its effects compared with those of placebo in a parallel group of patients. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: One reviewer (JSB) applied study selection criteria, assessed the quality of studies and extracted data. MAIN RESULTS: Nine trials, involving 4775 participants, were included in the analyses. Use of rivastigmine in high doses was associated with statistically significant benefits on several measures. High-dose rivastigmine (6 to 12 mg daily) was associated with a two-point improvement in cognitive function on the ADAS-Cog score compared with placebo (weighted mean difference -1.99, 95% confidence interval -2.49 to -1.50, on an intention-to-treat basis) and a 2.2 point improvement in activities of daily living assessed on the Progressive Deterioration Scale (weighted mean difference -2.15, 95% confidence interval -3.16 to -1.13, on an intention-to-treat basis) at 26 weeks. At lower doses (4 mg daily or lower) differences were in the same direction but were statistically significant only for cognitive function. There were statistically significantly higher numbers of events of nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, anorexia, headache, syncope, abdominal pain and dizziness among patients taking high-dose rivastigmine than among those taking placebo. There was some evidence that adverse events might be less common with more frequent, smaller doses of rivastigmine. The 2008 update includes a new study testing two types of rivastigmine transdermal patch, one delivering a higher dose than previously tested (17.4 mg/day) and a smaller patch delivering 9.6 mg/day. The efficacy of the smaller patch was not significantly different compared with the capsules of similar daily dose, but was associated with significantly fewer adverse events of nausea, vomiting, dizziness and asthenia. The efficacy of the larger patch was not significantly different compared with the smaller patch, but the smaller patch was associated with significantly fewer adverse events of nausea, vomiting, weight loss and dizziness. There appears to be advantages associated with the smaller patch compared with both the higher dose patch and the 6-12 mg/day capsules. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Rivastigmine appears to be beneficial for people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. In comparisons with placebo, improvements were seen in the rate of decline of cognitive function, activities of daily living, and severity of dementia with daily doses of 6 to 12 mg. Adverse events were consistent with the cholinergic actions of the drug. A transdermal patch has been tested in one trial, and there is evidence that the lower dose smaller patch is associated with fewer side effects than the capsules or the higher dose larger patch and has comparable efficacy to both. This review has not examined economic data.",

        "title": "Acute effects of brexpiprazole on serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine systems: an in vivo electrophysiologic characterization.",
        "abstract": "Brexpiprazole, a compound sharing structural molecular characteristics with aripiprazole, is currently under investigation for the treatment of schizophrenia and depression. Using electrophysiologic techniques, the present study assessed the in vivo action of brexpiprazole on serotonin (5-HT) receptor subtypes 5-HT1A, 5-HT1B, and 5-HT2A; dopamine (DA) D2 autoreceptors, and alpha1- and alpha2-adrenergic receptors. In addition, the effects on 5-HT1A autoreceptors in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) and D2 autoreceptors in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) were compared with those of aripiprazole, an agent in wide clinical use. In the DRN, brexpiprazole completely inhibited the firing of 5-HT neurons via 5-HT1A agonism and was more potent than aripiprazole (ED50 = 230 and 700 mug/kg, respectively). In the locus coeruleus, brexpiprazole reversed the inhibitory effect of the preferential 5-HT2A receptor agonist DOI (2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine) on norepinephrine neuronal firing (ED50 = 110 mug/kg), demonstrating 5-HT2A antagonistic action. Brexpiprazole reversed the inhibitory effect of the DA agonist apomorphine on VTA DA neurons (ED50 = 61 mug/kg), whereas it was ineffective when administered alone, indicating partial agonistic action on D2 receptors. Compared with aripiprazole, which significantly inhibited the firing activity of VTA DA neurons, brexpiprazole displayed less efficacy at D2 receptors. In the hippocampus, brexpiprazole acted as a full agonist at 5-HT1A receptors on pyramidal neurons. Furthermore, it increased 5-HT release by terminal alpha2-adrenergic heteroceptor but not 5-HT1B autoreceptor antagonism. In the lateral geniculate nucleus, brexpiprazole displayed alpha1B-adrenoceptor antagonistic action. Taken together, these results provide insight into the in vivo action of brexpiprazole on monoamine targets relevant in the treatment of depression and schizophrenia.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Sitagliptin (MK-0431 [(2R)-4-oxo-4-(3-[trifluoromethyl]-5,6-dihydro[1,2,4]triazolo[4,3-a]pyrazin-7[8H]-yl)-1-(2,4,5-trifluorophenyl)butan-2-amine]) is an orally active, potent, and selective inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) currently in phase III development for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. METHODS: Two double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, alternating-panel studies evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of single oral doses of sitagliptin (1.5-600 mg) in healthy male volunteers. RESULTS: Sitagliptin was well absorbed (approximately 80% excreted unchanged in the urine) with an apparent terminal half-life ranging from 8 to 14 hours. Renal clearance of sitagliptin averaged 388 mL/min and was largely uninfluenced by the dose administered. The area under the plasma concentration-time curve for sitagliptin increased in an approximately dose-dependent manner and was not meaningfully influenced by food. Single doses of sitagliptin markedly and dose-dependently inhibited plasma DPP-IV activity, with approximately 80% or greater inhibition of DPP-IV activity occurring at 50 mg or greater over a 12-hour period and at 100 mg or greater over a 24-hour period. Compared with placebo, sitagliptin produced an approximately 2-fold increase in postmeal active glucagon-like peptide 1 levels. Sitagliptin was well tolerated and was not associated with hypoglycemia. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides proof of pharmacologic characteristics for sitagliptin in humans. By inhibiting plasma DPP-IV activity, sitagliptin increases the postprandial rise in active glucagon-like peptide 1 concentrations without causing hypoglycemia in normoglycemic healthy male volunteers. Sitagliptin possesses pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics that support a once-daily dosing regimen.",

        "abstract": "Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist therapy to induce medical castration has become the most common form of hormonal therapy for advanced and metastatic prostate cancer. When treatment is started, LHRH agonists initially stimulate the release of LH, causing a surge in serum testosterone that can precipitate a \"flare\" phenomenon or worsening of disease, particularly in patients with bone metastatic disease. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) receptor antagonism represents a newer approach to medical castration. Abarelix is a pure GnRH receptor antagonist that is devoid of any LHRH agonist activity. Results from 1 phase II and 3 phase III clinical trials demonstrate that abarelix produces medical castration more quickly and without causing testosterone surge, as compared with LHRH agonists with or without a nonsteroidal antagonist. The safety profile in terms of adverse events is comparable between the 2 types of treatment, but the lack of testosterone surge with abarelix might confer a safety advantage by abolishing the risk of a disease flare.",

        "abstract": "Oxytocin antagonist (OTA), TT-235, was developed by our group and shown to inhibit either spontaneous or oxytocin-induced uterine contractions in primates. The purpose of the present study was to confirm the duration of TT-235 to block oxytocin-induced uterine contractions in estrous rats. In Experiment 1, the time-response of the three OTAs on uterine contractility was examined. The rats were anesthetized and cannulas were placed in the jugular vein for infusing vehicle (sterile saline), Antag I, Antag II and TT-235. The uterine activity was monitored through a water-filled balloon-tipped cannula placed in the uterine horn. The uterine contractile activity was determined as the integrated area for 10 minutes. Each OTA was administered as a single bolus injection of 5 microg, followed by 100 mU of oxytocin 5 minutes later, also done as a single bolus. Oxytocin injection of the same dosage was repeated every hour for 5 hours. Experiment 2 determined the effect of the three OTAs on uterine oxytocin receptor number (Rn) and binding affinity (Kd). Rats treated with either OTA or vehicle were sacrificed at 0.5 and 4 hours for receptor assay. In Experiment 1, Antag I, Antag II and TT-235 inhibited the integrated uterine response to oxytocin at 5 minutes by 76%, 77% and 80%, respectively, compared to controls (p&lt;0.05). Two hours after injecting Antag I, inhibition of uterine contractility was 55% lower than controls (p&lt;0.05). At 3 hours, uterine contractility was no longer affected in rats treated with Antag I compared with controls. The suppressive uterine activity with Antag II continued up to 3 hours. However, uterine contractility remained lower (53%) in rats treated with TT-235 5 hours later. In Experiment 2, TT-235 induced a significant decrease (p&lt;0.05) in oxytocin receptor number and binding affinity at both 0.5 and 4 hours compared with controls. Antag I and Antag II did not alter oxytocin receptor number or binding affinity significantly at each time point studied compared with controls. In conclusion, TT-235 may inhibit the uterine response to oxytocin by decreasing oxytocin receptor numbers and oxytocin binding affinity, which might explain the prolonged oxytocin antagonist activity of TT-235.",

MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study was case-control in design, with cases presenting to the emergency department with acute severe asthma and controls randomly selected from a larger cross-sectional study. Plasma malondialdehyde (MDA) was used as a measure of oxidative stress and plasma selenium was measured using ICP-MS. Glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity was analysed using a colorimetric GPx assay and plasma GPx level was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: Fifteen cases [mean (range) predicted peak expiratory flow rate (PEFR) of 43% (20-69)] and 15 matched controls were recruited. MDA levels (mean+/-SD) were higher in acute asthma subjects (1.30+/-0.56 micromol/L) than in controls (0.86+/-0.53 micromol/L; p&lt;0.05). There were no differences between cases and controls for selenium (99+/-34 microg/L versus 109+/-17 microg/L) or for GPx activity (39+/-25 nmol min(-1) mL(-1) versus 38+/-24 nmol min(-1) mL(-1)), however, GPx plasma levels measured by ELISA were higher in cases than controls (22.5+/-10.8 mg/L versus 13.8+/-7.3 mg/L; p&lt;0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with acute severe asthma demonstrated increased MDA levels but no differences in plasma selenium levels or GPx activity. GPx levels measured by ELISA were elevated in severe asthma. These results are consistent with an adaptive up-regulation of GPx to protect against oxidative stress.",

        "abstract": "Hyaluronidase counteracts the growth inhibitory function of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), whereas secretion of autocrine TGF-beta and hyaluronidase is necessary for progression and metastasis of various cancers. Whether hyaluronidase and TGF-beta1 induce resistance to staurosporine in L929 fibrosarcoma cells was investigated. When pretreated with TGF-beta1 for 1-2 h, L929 cells resisted staurosporine apoptosis. In contrast, without pretreatment, hyaluronidase protected L929 cells fromstaurosporine apoptosis. Hyaluronidase rapidly activated p42/44 MAPK (or ERK) in L929 cells and TGF-beta1 retarded the activation. Nonetheless, TGF-beta1 synergistically increased hyaluronidase-mediated inhibition of staurosporine apoptosis. Hyaluronidase rapidly activated c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK1 and JNK2) in L929 cells in 20 min. Dominant negative JNK1, JNK2, and JNK3 abolished the hyaluronidase inhibition of staurosporine apoptosis, but not the TGF-beta1 protective effect. Unlike the resistance to staurosporine, pretreatment of L929 cells with hyaluronidase is necessary to generate resistance to other anticancer drugs, including doxorubicin, daunorubicin, actinomycin D, and camptothecin, and the induced resistance was also blocked by dominant-negative JNKs. Together, hyaluronidase-mediated JNK activation is necessary to generate resistance to various anticancer drugs in L929 cells.",

The enzyme was purified from the cytosol of Dictyostelium discoideum using GTP-agarose chromatography as the critical step. It has an apparent molecular mass of 44 kDa. Monoclonal antibodies identified several forms of the enzyme with pI values between 8.1 and 9.0. Michaelis-Menten constants (Km) were low for the nucleotide substrates IMP (Km = 30 microM) and GTP (Km = 35 microM) as compared with the value for aspartic acid (Km = 440 microM). These values are in good agreement with constants reported from other organisms. Immunological studies indicated that the protein is predominantly localized in the cytosol and only partially associated with particulate fractions. The enzyme is present throughout the developmental cycle of D. discoideum. Using monoclonal antibodies, the gene was cloned from a lambda gt11 expression library. The complete sequence represents the first reported primary structure of an eucaryotic adenylosuccinate synthetase. Southern blots hybridized with a cDNA probe demonstrate that adenylosuccinate synthetase is encoded by a single gene and contains at least one intron. The deduced amino acid sequence shows 43% identity to adenylosuccinate synthetase from Escherichia coli. Homologous regions include short sequence motifs, such as the glycine-rich loop which is typical for GTP-binding proteins.",

        "abstract": "Nalbuphine is a potent agonist/antagonist analgesic with a low side effect profile and low abuse potential. Previous studies have shown that nalbuphine produces predominantly agonist (analgesic) effects at kappa receptors and antagonist (morphine-reversal) effects at mu receptors in vivo. The present study was designed to localize the sites of nalbuphine binding to mu, delta and kappa opioid receptors in the central nervous system (CNS) using in vitro labeling light microscopic autoradiography. Mu, delta and kappa opioid receptors were labeled selectively using [3H]dihydromorphine, D-[3H]Ala2-D-Leu5-enkephalin and (-)-[3H]ethylketocyclazocine, respectively. In displacement studies in rat brain homogenates, nalbuphine had the highest affinity (Ki) for mu receptors (0.5 nM) with progressively lower affinities for kappa (29 nM) and delta (60 nM) opioid receptors. In autoradiographic studies in slide-mounted sections of guinea pig brain and monkey spinal cord, nalbuphine (300 nM) displaced completely the binding at mu and kappa receptors without significantly altering the binding at delta receptors. The binding of [3H]nalbuphine in slide-mounted sections of guinea pig forebrain was saturable and showed a curvilinear profile indicating the presence of two binding sites with apparent dissociation constant (Kd) values of 0.5 and 12 nM. Morphine and U-50,488H, which have high affinities for mu and kappa opioid receptors, respectively, inhibited [3H]nalbuphine binding with IC50 values of 0.9 and 10 nM, respectively. In saturation studies, morphine (50 nM) and U-50,488H (100 nM) selectively blocked the high and low affinity components of [3H]nalbuphine binding, respectively. The autoradiographic distribution of [3H]nalbuphine binding sites in the CNS corresponds well to the distribution of mu and kappa opioid receptors. In addition, CNS areas (deep layers of the cerebral cortex, laminae I and II of the spinal cord, substantia gelatinosa of the trigeminal nerve, periaqueductal gray and thalamic nuclei) that mediate analgesia contain high concentrations of [3H]nalbuphine binding sites. In summary, these data demonstrate that nalbuphine acts on mu and kappa opioid receptors and identify anatomical loci in the CNS in which nalbuphine may produce its actions.",

In addition to the previously published full-length cDNA, forms coding for a truncated and an alternatively spliced version were identified. Aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase catalyzes the decarboxylation of L-5-hydroxytryptophan to serotonin and that of L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine to dopamine. Interestingly, pyridoxal phosphate is the cofactor of both aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase and glutamate decarboxylase.

We established that among fish oil polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs), eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), but not docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), greatly decreased interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta)-induced PGHS-2 expression in human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells (HPMECs). Lipoxygenase products 12 (S)-hydroperoxyeicosapentaenoic acid ((S)-HpEPE), 15 (S)-HpEPE and leukotriene (LT) D5 reproduced similar inhibitory effect, suggesting that they may be the intermediate metabolites responsible for PGHS-2 down-regulation by EPA. Accordingly, the EPA effect is prevented by nordihydroguaiaretic acid (NDGA) and by REV 5901, nonspecific and specific 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors, respectively. Besides, inhibition of cyclooxygenase activity by ibuprofen, indomethacin or aspirin was not able to prevent this effect. Moreover, cyclooxygenase metabolites of EPA (PGs D3, E3 and I3) markedly potentiate IL-1beta-induced PGHS-2 expression, probably by increasing intracellular cAMP levels. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are known to be activated by fatty acids (FAs) such as EPA. We found here that HPMECs express only weak amounts of PPARalpha and PPARgamma whose activation by synthetic agonists, Wy-14,643 and ciglitazone, does not cause any inhibition of IL-1beta-induced PGHS-2 expression. This finding ruled out the involvement of PPARs in the EPA inhibitory effect. In addition, we established that EPA, which failed to inhibit nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) activation, suppressed p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphorylation in stimulated HPMECs. Our data demonstrate that EPA, unlike DHA, down-regulates PGHS-2 expression in HPMECs probably through its 5-lipoxygenase-dependent metabolites and advocates a beneficial role for this FA in limiting inflammatory response.",

        "abstract": "The possible role of the central beta-domain (residues 151-287) of streptokinase (SK) was probed by site-specifically altering two charged residues at a time to alanines in a region (residues 230-290) previously identified by Peptide Walking to play a key role in plasminogen (PG) activation. These mutants were then screened for altered ability to activate equimolar \"partner\" human PG, or altered interaction with substrate PG resulting in an overall compromised capability for substrate PG processing. Of the eight initial alanine-linker mutants of SK, one mutant, viz. SK(KK256.257AA) (SK-D1), showed a roughly 20-fold reduction in PG activator activity in comparison to wild-type SK expressed in Escherichia coli (nSK). Five other mutants were as active as nSK, with two [SK(RE248.249AA) and SK(EK281.282AA), referred to as SK(C) and SK(H), respectively] showing specific activities approximately one-half and two-thirds, respectively, that of nSK. Unlike SK(C) and SK(H), however, SK(D1) showed an extended initial delay in the kinetics of PG activation. These features were drastically accentuated when the charges on the two Lys residues at positions 256 and 257 of nSK were reversed, to obtain SK(KK256.257EE) [SK(D2)]. This mutant showed a PG activator activity approximately 10-fold less than that of SK(D1). Remarkably, inclusion of small amounts of human plasmin (PN) in the PG activation reactions of SK(D2) resulted in a dramatic, PN dose-dependent rejuvenation of its PG activation capability, indicating that it required pre-existing PN to form a functional activator since it could not effect active site exposure in partner PG on its own, a conclusion further confirmed by its inability to show a \"burst\" of p-nitrophenol release in the presence of equimolar human PG and p-nitrophenyl guanidino benzoate. The steady-state kinetic parameters for HPG activation of its 1:1 complex with human PN revealed that although it could form a highly functional activator once \"supplied\" with a mature active site, the Km for PG was increased nearly eightfold in comparison to that of nSK-PN. SK mutants carrying simultaneous two- and three-site charge-cluster alterations, viz., SK(RE24249AA:EK281.282AA) [SK(CH)], SK(EK272.273AA;EK281.282AA) [SK(FH)], and SK(RE248.249AA;EK272.273AA:EK281.282AA+ ++) [SK(CFH)], showed additive/synergistic influence of multiple charge-cluster mutations on HPG activation when compared to the respective \"single-site\" mutants, with the \"triple-site\" mutant [SK(CFH)] showing absolutely no detectable HPG activation ability. Nevertheless, like the other constructs, the double- and triple-charge cluster mutants retained a native like affinity for complexation with partner PG. Their overall structure also, as judged by far-ultraviolet circular dichroism, was closely similar to that of nSK. These results provide the first experimental evidence for a direct assistance by the SK beta-domain in the docking and processing of substrate PG by the activator complex, a facet not readily evident probably because of the flexibility of this domain in the recent X-ray crystal structure of the SK-plasmin light chain complex.",

        "abstract": "The aim of the present experiment was to assess the involvement of adenosine receptor antagonists in benzodiazepine (BDZ) withdrawal signs, observed as the seizure susceptibility in mice. The discontinuation of chronic treatment with temazepam or diazepam decreased seizure threshold (one of BDZ withdrawal signs). The concomitant application of subconvulsive dose of pentetrazole (55.0 mg/kg) with low dose of flumazenil (5.0 mg/kg) - a BDZ receptor antagonist, immediately induced BDZ withdrawal signs in these animals. The non-selective adenosine receptor antagonist (caffeine), and the selective adenosine A1 receptor antagonist (DPCPX), injected 15 min before the application of pentetrazole and flumazenil, were able to intensify BDZ withdrawal signs in mice. The most apparent effects were observed after administration of DPCPX, indicating that the adenosine A1 receptor may play a more important role in these effects. The obtained data demonstrate that the adenosinergic system is involved in BDZ withdrawal signs in mice, and adenosine A1 receptor plays an important role in this process.",

In studying kinetics of tryptophan hydroxylase and aromatic-L-amino acid decarboxylase (AAAD) in human carcinoid hepatic metastases and adjacent normal liver (J. A. Gilbert et al, Biochem. Pharmacol., 50: 845-850, 1995), we identified one significant difference: the Vmax of carcinoid AAAD was 50-fold higher than that in normal liver. Here, we report Western and Northern analyses detecting large quantities of AAAD polypeptide and mRNA in human carcinoid primary as well as metastatic tumors compared with normal surrounding tissues. To assess the feasibility of targeting these high AAAD levels for chemotherapy, AAAD inhibitors carbidopa (alpha-methyl-dopahydrazine), alpha-monofluoromethyldopa (MFMD), and 3-hydroxybenzylhydrazine (NSD-1015) were incubated (72 h) with NCI-H727 human lung carcinoid cells. Carbidopa and MFMD were lethal (IC50 = 29 +/- 2 microM and 56 +/- 6 microM, respectively); NSD-1015 had no effect on proliferation. On exposure to other human tumor lines, carbidopa was lethal only to NCI-H146 and NCI-H209 small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC) lines (IC50 = 12 +/- 1 microM and 22 +/- 5 microM, respectively). Carbidopa (100 microM) decreased growth of (but did not kill) SK-N-SH neuroblastoma and A204 rhabdomyosarcoma cells and did not affect proliferation of DU 145 prostate, MCF7 breast, or NCI-H460 large cell lung carcinoma lines. The rank order of lines by AAAD activity was NCI-H146 &gt; NCI-H209 &gt; SK-N-SH &gt; NCI-H727, whereas A204, DU 145, MCF7, and NCI-H460 had no measurable activity. For lung tumor lines (carcinoid, two SCLC, and one large cell lung carcinoma), AAAD activity was correlated with the potency of carbidopa-induced cytotoxicity. However, carcinoid cell death was not solely attributable to complete inhibition of either AAAD activity or the serotonin synthetic pathway. In further evaluating potential applications of these findings with carbidopa, we determined that sublethal doses of carbidopa produced additive cytotoxic effects in carcinoid cells in combination with etoposide and cytotoxic synergy in SCLC cells when coincubated with topotecan.",

        "abstract": "1. The pharmacological profile of valsartan, (S)-N-valeryl-N-([2'-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)biphenyl-4-yl]-methyl)-vali ne, a potent, highly selective, and orally active antagonist at the angiotensin II (AII) AT1-receptor, was studied in vitro and in vivo. 2. Valsartan competed with [125I]-AII at its specific binding sites in rat aortic smooth muscle cell membranes (AT1-receptor subtype) with a Ki of 2.38 nM, but was about 30,000 times less active in human myometrial membranes (AT2-receptor subtype). 3. In rabbit aortic rings incubated for 5 min with valsartan, at concentrations of 2, 20 and 200 nM, the concentration-response curve of AII was displaced to the right and the maximum response was reduced by 33%, 36% and 40%, respectively. Prolongation of the incubation time with valsartan to 1 h or 3 h, further reduced the maximum response by 48% or 59% (after 20 nM) and by 59% or 60% (after 200 nM) respectively. After 3 h incubation an apparent pKb value of 9.26 was calculated. Contractions induced by noradrenaline, 5-hydroxytryptamine, or potassium chloride were not affected by valsartan. No agonistic effects were observed in the rabbit aorta at concentrations of valsartan up to 2 microM. 4. In bovine adrenal glomerulosa, valsartan inhibited AII-stimulated aldosterone release without affecting the maximum response (pA2 8.4). 5. In the pithed rat, oral administration of valsartan (10 mg kg-1) shifted the AII-induced pressor response curves to the right, without affecting responses induced by the electrical stimulation of the sympathetic outflow or by noradrenaline. Animals treated with valsartan 24 h before pithing also showed significant inhibition of the response to AII. 6. In conscious, two-kidney, one-clip renal hypertensive rats (2K1C), valsartan decreased blood pressure in a dose-dependent manner after single i.v. or oral administration. The respective ED30 values were 0.06 mg kg-1 (i.v.) and 1.4 mg kg-1 (p.o.). The antihypertensive effect lasted for at least 24 h after either route of administration. After repeated oral administration for 4 days (3 and 10 mg kg-1 daily), in 2K1C renal hypertensive rats, systolic blood pressure was consistently decreased, but heart rate was not significantly affected. 7. In conscious, normotensive, sodium-depleted marmosets, valsartan decreased mean arterial pressure, measured by telemetry, after oral doses of 1-30 mg kg-1. The hypotensive effect persisted up to 12 h after 3 and 10 mg kg-1 and up to 24 h after 30 mg kg-1. 8. In sodium-depleted marmosets, the hypotensive effect of valsartan lasted longer than that of losartan(DuP 753). In renal hypertensive rats, both agents had a similar duration (24 h), but a different onset of action (valsartan at 1 h, losartan between 2 h and 24 h).9. These results demonstrate that valsartan is a potent, specific, highly selective antagonist of AII at theAT1-receptor subtype and does not possess agonistic activity. Furthermore, it is an efficacious, orally active, blood pressure-lowering agent in conscious renal hypertensive rats and in conscious normotensive,sodium-depleted primates.",

        "abstract": "Oseltamivir carboxylate is a potent and specific inhibitor of influenza neuraminidase (NA). An influenza A/H1N1 variant selected in vitro with reduced susceptibility to oseltamivir carboxylate contains a His274Tyr mutation. To understand the mechanism by which a His274Tyr mutation gives rise to drug resistance, we studied a series of NA variant proteins containing various substitutions at position 274. Replacement of His274 with larger side chain residues (Tyr or Phe) reduced the NA sensitivity to oseltamivir carboxylate. In contrast, replacement of His274 with smaller side chain residues (Gly, Asn, Ser, and Gln) resulted in enhanced or unchanged sensitivity to oseltamivir carboxylate. Previous studies have suggested that the slow-binding inhibition of NA by oseltamivir carboxylate is a result of the reorientation of Glu276. Loss of this slow-binding inhibition in the His274Tyr and His274Phe mutant NA but not in His274Asn, His274Gly, His274Ser, or His274Gln supports the conclusion that the conformational change of Glu276 is restricted in the His274Tyr and His274Phe mutant NA upon oseltamivir carboxylate binding. Interestingly, His274Asn, as well as His274Gly, His274Ser, and His274Gln, also displayed reduced sensitivity to zanamivir and its analogue, 4-amino-Neu5Ac2en. Substitution of His274 with Tyr in influenza A/Tokyo/3/67 (H3N2) recombinant NA did not affect the susceptibility to oseltamivir carboxylate. These data indicate that the volume occupied by the amino acid side chain at position 274 can influence the sensitivities of influenza N1 NA but not of N2 NA to both oseltamivir carboxylate and zanamivir.",

Hyperphosphatemia in patients with ESRD leads to secondary hyperparathyroidism, renal osteodystrophy, and is independently associated with mortality risk. The exact mechanism by which hyperphosphatemia increases mortality risk is unknown, but it may relate to enhanced cardiovascular calcification. National Kidney Foundation K/DOQI bone metabolism and disease guidelines recommend maintenance of serum phosphorus (P) below 5.5 mg/dL, and Ca x P product less than 55 mg(2)/dL(2). Although calcium-based phosphate binders (CBPB) are cost effective, long-term safety concerns relate to their postulated role in progression of cardiovascular calcification. Sevelamer hydrochloride has been recommended as an alternative noncalcium phosphate binder. Results from the Calcium Acetate Renagel Evaluation (CARE study) indicate that calcium acetate is more effective than sevelamer in controlling serum phosphorous and Ca x P product in hemodialysis patients. In the Treat-to-Goal study, dialysis patients treated with sevelamer had slower progression of coronary and aortic calcification than patients treated with CBPB. The mechanism underlying the beneficial effect of sevelamer is unknown, but may relate to decreased calcium loading or to dramatic reductions in LDL cholesterol in sevelamer-treated patients. At present, evidence incriminating CBPB in the progression of cardiovascular calcification in ESRD remains largely circumstantial.

        "abstract": "Inhibition by triacsins and troglitazone of long chain fatty acid incorporation into cellular lipids suggests the existence of inhibitor-sensitive and -resistant acyl-CoA synthetases (ACS, EC ) that are linked to specific metabolic pathways. In order to test this hypothesis, we cloned and purified rat ACS1, ACS4, and ACS5, the isoforms present in liver and fat cells, expressed the isoforms as ACS-Flag fusion proteins in Escherichia coli, and purified them by Flag affinity chromatography. The Flag epitope at the C terminus did not alter the kinetic properties of the enzyme. Purified ACS1-, 4-, and 5-Flag isoforms differed in their apparent K(m) values for ATP, thermolability, pH optima, requirement for Triton X-100, and sensitivity to N-ethylmaleimide and phenylglyoxal. The ACS inhibitor triacsin C strongly inhibited ACS1 and ACS4, but not ACS5. The thiazolidinedione (TZD) insulin-sensitizing drugs and peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) ligands, troglitazone, rosiglitazone, and pioglitazone, strongly and specifically inhibited only ACS4, with an IC(50) of less than 1.5 microm. Troglitazone exhibited a mixed type inhibition of ACS4. alpha-Tocopherol, whose ring structure forms the non-TZD portion of troglitazone, did not inhibit ACS4, indicating that the thiazolidine-2,4-dione moiety is the critical component for inhibition. A non-TZD PPARgamma ligand, GW1929, which is 7-fold more potent than rosiglitazone, inhibited ACS1 and ACS4 poorly with an IC(50) of greater than 50 microm, more than 100-fold higher than was required for rosiglitazone, thereby demonstrating the specificity of TZD inhibition. Further, the PPARalpha ligands, clofibrate and GW4647, and various xenobiotic carboxylic acids known to be incorporated into complex lipids had no effect on ACS1, -4, or -5. These results, together with previous data showing that triacsin C and troglitazone strongly inhibit triacylglycerol synthesis compared with other metabolic pathways, suggest that ACS1 and ACS4 catalyze the synthesis of acyl-CoAs used for triacylglycerol synthesis and that lack of inhibition of a metabolic pathway by triacsin C does not prove lack of acyl-CoA involvement. The results further suggest the possibility that the insulin-sensitizing effects of the thiazolidinedione drugs might be achieved, in part, through direct interaction with ACS4 in a PPARgamma-independent manner.",

Millimolar increases in extracellular calcium ([Ca2+]o, EC50 = 8 mM) cause a rapid elevation in [Ca2+]i after a calcitonin dose-dependent pretreatment of cells (pretreatment EC50 = 0.2 nM sCT). Cells exhibit persistent sensitivity to increased [Ca2+]o up to 3 h after hormone exposure and even after multiple cycles of increased [Ca2+]o followed by wash. Calcitonin pretreatment of cells also allows apparent influx of elevated extracellular strontium and manganese, but little or no effect is observed on addition of barium, cadmium, or lanthanum. Human amylin (100 nM) causes a rapid and transient increase in [Ca2+]i comparable to that of calcitonin; however, no significant response to increased [Ca2+]o is observed after amylin addition. Human calcitonin gene-related product (hCGRP) (300 nM) and forskolin do not increase [Ca2+]i or activate a sensitivity to increased [Ca2+]o. Nevertheless, human amylin and human calcitonin gene-related product (hCGRP) activate adenylate cyclase with EC50s of 0.7 nM and 8 nM, respectively. The calcium-channel drugs verapamil, BAY K 8644, diltiazem, and nifedipine have little effect on [Ca2+]i increases. The calcitonin-induced transient mobilization of calcium is inhibited by treatment of cells with cholera toxin or 8-(diethylamino)-octyl-3,4,5-trimethoxybenzoate (TMB-8); whereas, the response to subsequent increased [Ca2+]o is inhibited by lanthanum chloride (200 microM) and lower pH (6.0).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To determine the presence of adenosine receptor subtypes A1 and A2a in equine forebrain tissues and to characterize the interactions of caffeine and its metabolites with adenosine receptors in the CNS of horses. SAMPLE POPULATION: Brain tissue specimens obtained during necropsy from 5 adult male research horses. PROCEDURE: Membrane-enriched homogenates from cerebral cortex and striatum were evaluated by radioligand binding assays with the A1-selective ligand [3H]DPCPX and the A2a-selective ligand [3H]ZM241385. Functional responses to adenosine receptor agonists and antagonists were determined by a nucleotide exchange assay using [35S]-guanosine 5'-(gamma-thio) triphosphate ([35S]GTPgammaS). RESULTS: Saturable high affinity [3H]DPCPX binding (A1) sites were detected in cerebral cortex and striatum, whereas high-affinity [3H]ZM241385 binding (A2a) sites were detected only in striatum. Caffeine and related methylxanthines had similar binding affinities at A1 and A2a sites with rank orders of drug binding affinities (theophylline &gt; paraxanthine &gt; or = caffeine &gt;&gt; theobromine) similar to other species. [35S]GTPgammaS exchange revealed that caffeine and its metabolites act as pure adenosine receptor antagonists at concentrations that correspond to A1 and A2a receptor binding affinities. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results of our study affirm the presence of guanine nucleotide binding protein linked adenosine receptors (ie, high-affinity A1 and A2a adenosine receptors) in equine forebrain tissues and reveal the antagonistic actions by caffeine and several biologically active caffeine metabolites. Antagonism of adenosine actions in the equine CNS by these stimulants may be responsible for some central actions of methylxanthine drugs, including motor stimulation and enhanced racing performance.",

        "abstract": "We investigated the effects of methylxanthines on enzymatic activity of phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks). We found that caffeine inhibits the in vitro lipid kinase of class I PI3Ks (IC(50) = 75 microm for p110 delta, 400 microm for p110 alpha and p110 beta, and 1 mm for p110 gamma), and theophylline has similar effects (IC(50) = 75 microm for p110 delta, 300 microm for p110 alpha, and 800 microm for p110 beta and p110 gamma) and also inhibits the alpha isoform of class II PI3K (PI3K-C2 alpha) (IC(50) approximately 400 microm). However, four other xanthine derivatives tested (3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine, 3-propylxanthine, alloxazine, and PD116948 (8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine)) were an order of magnitude less effective. Surprisingly the triazoloquinazoline CGS15943 (9-chloro-2-(2-furyl)(1,2,d)triazolo(1,5-c)quinazolin-5-amine) also selectively inhibits p110 delta (IC(50) &lt; 10 microm). Caffeine and theophylline also inhibit the intrinsic protein kinase activity of the class IA PI3Ks and DNA-dependent protein kinase, although with a much lower potency than that for the lipid kinase (IC(50) approximately 10 mm for p110 alpha, 3 mm for p110 beta, and 10 mm for DNA-dependent protein kinase). In CHO-IR cells and rat soleus muscle, theophylline and caffeine block the ability of insulin to stimulate protein kinase B with IC(50) values similar to those for inhibition of PI3K activity, whereas insulin stimulation of ERK1 or ERK2 was not inhibited at concentrations up to 10 mm. Theophylline and caffeine also blocked insulin stimulation of glucose transport in CHO-IR cells. These results demonstrate that these methylxanthines are direct inhibitors of PI3K lipid kinase activity but are distinctly less effective against serine kinase activity and thus could be of potential use in dissecting these two distinct kinase activities. Theophylline, caffeine, and CGS15943 may be of particular use in dissecting the specific role of the p110 delta lipid kinase. Finally, we conclude that inhibition of PI3K (p110 delta in particular) is likely explain some of the physiological and pharmacological properties of caffeine and theophylline.",

From a homology model of the 3-D structure of DHFR-TS, rational drug design techniques have been used to design and subsequently synthesize inhibitors able to overcome malarial pyrimethamine resistance. Compared to pyrimethamine (Ki 1.5 nM) with purified recombinant DHFR fromP. falciparum, the Ki value of the m-methoxy analogue of pyrimethamine was 1.07 nM, but against the DHFR bearing the double mutation (C59R + S108N), the Ki values for pyrimethamine and the m-methoxy analogue were 71.7 and 14.0 nM, respectively. The m-chloro analogue of pyrimethamine was a stronger inhibitor of both wild-type DHFR (with Ki 0.30 nM) and the doubly mutant (C59R +S108N) purified enzyme (with Ki 2.40 nM). Growth of parasite cultures of P. falciparum in vitro was also strongly inhibited by these compounds with 50% inhibition of growth occurring at 3.7 microM for the m-methoxy and 0.6 microM for the m-chloro compounds with the K1 parasite line bearing the double mutation (S108N + C59R), compared to 10.2 microM for pyrimethamine.

        "abstract": "Forty-four sulfa drugs were screened against crude preparations of recombinant Pneumocystis carinii dihydropteroate synthetase. The apparent Michaelis-Menten constants (Km) for p-aminobenzoic acid and 7,8-dihydro-6-hydroxymethylpterin pyrophosphate were 0.34 +/- 0.02 and 2.50 +/- 0.71 microM, respectively. Several sulfa drugs, including sulfathiazole, sulfachlorpyridazine, sulfamethoxypyridazine, and sulfathiourea, inhibited dihydropteroate synthetase approximately as well as sulfamethoxazole, as determined by the concentrations which cause 50% inhibition and/or by Ki. For all sulfones and sulfonamides tested, unsubstituted p-amino groups were necessary for activity, and sulfonamides containing an N1-heterocyclic substituent were found to be the most effective inhibitors. Folate biosynthesis in isolated intact P. carinii was approximately equally sensitive to inhibition by sulfamethoxazole, sulfachlorpyridazine, sulfamethoxypyridazine, sulfisoxazole, and sulfathiazole. Two of these drugs, sulfamethoxypyridazine and sulfisoxazole, are known to be less toxic than sulfamethoxazole and should be further evaluated for the treatment of P. carinii pneumonia.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The contribution of nonangiotensinergic effects of converting enzyme inhibitors to their hemodynamic effects in patients with chronic heart failure is not clear. A comparison of the effects of renin and converting enzyme inhibition should help to clarify this issue. METHODS AND RESULTS: Thirty-six patients with chronic heart failure (New York Heart Association class II or III) were randomly assigned to receive double-blind either intravenous placebo, the renin inhibitor remikiren, or the converting enzyme inhibitor enalaprilat followed by coinfusion of a second placebo infusion, the addition of remikiren to enalaprilat, or the addition of enalaprilat to remikiren, respectively. Systemic hemodynamics (Swan-Ganz and radial artery catheters) were measured before (rest and submaximal recumbent bicycle ergometry), during (rest), and at the end (rest and exercise) of each 45-minute single- or combination-infusion period. Placebo did not change hemodynamics or renin activity. Effective inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system by remikiren and enalaprilat was indicated by increases of plasma immunoreactive renin together with rapid and complete inhibition of renin activity after remikiren and an increase after enalaprilat (all P &lt; or = .05). Remikiren and enalaprilat rapidly and to a similar extent reduced resting blood pressure through a reduction of systemic vascular resistance, and these changes were significantly correlated to baseline plasma renin activity. Both compounds also decreased pulmonary artery, pulmonary capillary wedge, and right atrial pressures to a similar extent (P &lt; .05). During exercise, pulmonary capillary wedge and right atrial pressures were equally reduced and stroke volume index was increased with remikiren and enalaprilat (P &lt; .05) for both). The combination of converting enzyme with renin inhibition or vice versa did not cause additional hemodynamic changes. CONCLUSIONS: Specific renin inhibition in patients with chronic heart failure produces short-term hemodynamic effects that are almost indistinguishable from those of converting enzyme inhibition. This finding and the lack of additional effects of converting enzyme inhibition added to renin inhibition suggest that nonangiotensinergic effects of converting enzyme inhibitors do not play a significant role in their short-term hemodynamic effects in patients with chronic heart failure.",

        "abstract": "Tramadol is thought to induce analgesia via both opioid and non-opioid pathways, although the precise mechanisms remain to be elucidated. In this study, we investigated the roles of the mu-opioid receptor (MOP) in analgesic and rewarding effects of tramadol by using MOP knockout (KO) mice. Tramadol-induced antinociception, assessed by hot-plate and tail-flick tests, was significantly reduced in heterozygous and homozygous MOP-KO mice when compared with that in wild-type mice. Interestingly, however, tramadol retained its ability to induce significant antinociception in homozygous MOP-KO mice. The tramadol-induced antinociception remaining in homozygous MOP-KO mice was not significantly affected by methysergide, a serotonin receptor antagonist, but was partially blocked by yohimbine, an adrenaline alpha2 receptor antagonist, and both naloxone, a non-selective opioid receptor antagonist, and yohimbine. In addition, antinociceptive effects of an active tramadol metabolite M1 were abolished or remarkably reduced in MOP-KO mice. On the other hand, neither wild-type nor homozygous MOP-KO mice showed significant place preference for tramadol in a conditioned place preference test, although there were slight tendencies toward preference in wild-type mice and avoidance in homozygous MOP-KO mice. These results strongly support the idea suggested in the previous pharmacological studies that MOP and the adrenaline alpha2 receptor mediate most of the analgesic properties of tramadol.",

        "abstract": "D-Cycloserine (DCS) targets the peptidoglycan biosynthetic enzymes D-alanine racemase (Alr) and D-alanine:D-alanine ligase (Ddl). Previously, we demonstrated that the overproduction of Alr in Mycobacterium smegmatis determines a DCS resistance phenotype. In this study, we investigated the roles of both Alr and Ddl in the mechanisms of action of and resistance to DCS in M. smegmatis. We found that the overexpression of either the M. smegmatis or the Mycobacterium tuberculosis ddl gene in M. smegmatis confers resistance to DCS, but at lower levels than the overexpression of the alr gene. Furthermore, a strain overexpressing both the alr and ddl genes displayed an eightfold-higher level of resistance. To test the hypothesis that inhibition of Alr by DCS decreases the intracellular pool of D-alanine, we determined the alanine pools in M. smegmatis wild-type and recombinant strains with or without DCS treatment. Alr-overproducing strain GPM14 cells not exposed to DCS displayed almost equimolar amounts of L- and D-alanine in the steady state. The wild-type strain and Ddl-overproducing strains contained a twofold excess of L- over D-alanine. In all strains, DCS treatment led to a significant accumulation of L-alanine and a concomitant decease of D-alanine, with approximately a 20-fold excess of L-alanine in the Ddl-overproducing strains. These data suggest that Ddl is not significantly inhibited by DCS at concentrations that inhibit Alr. This study is of significance for the identification of the lethal target(s) of DCS and the development of novel drugs targeting the D-alanine branch of mycobacterial peptidoglycan biosynthesis.",

        "abstract": "Thrombolytic therapy has become a standard treatment for selected patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI). Various thrombolytic agents have been shown to decrease mortality. However, current thrombolytic agents still suffer significant shortcomings, such as a low optimal reperfusion rate delayed reperfusion. and incomplete myocardial perfusion. Furthermore, cyclic flow variations and reocclu.sions remain a significant cause of late morbidity and mortality. In thrombolysis with tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA), heparin seems to play an important role. However, it has several features that suggest that it may not be the optimal adjunct to thrombolytics, including weak and indirect action on thrombin, little access to clot-bound thrombin, inhibition by acute-phase plasma proteins, and its direct stimulation of platelet aggregation. Argatroban (NOVASTAN(R)), a small-molecule, synthetic, direct thrombin inhibitor, has several potential advantages over heparin, and prior studies suggest superior thrombin inhibition with favorable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties warranting further investigation The Myocardial Infarction using NOVASTAN (R) and t-PA (MINT) study is a phase II, single-blind, angiographic trial directly comparing heparin versus two doses of argatroban in 120 patients with ST-elevation MI who present within 6 hours of symptom onset. The primary objective of the MINT trial is to assess the TIMI grade 3 flow and TIMI Frame Count at 90 minutes after the initiation of t-PA. This trial will also evaluate the safety of the combination of t-PA, argatroban, and aspirin. The incidence of clinical or silent ischemia, will be monitored. All patients will be followed up to 30 days for the composite endpoint of death, nonfatal recurrent myocardial infarction, coronary artery bypass surgery, PTCA, recurrent ischemia, and shock/new-onset heart failure.",

        "abstract": "The effect of enzymatically generated reduced oxygen metabolites on the activity of hepatic microsomal glutathione S-transferase activity was studied to explore possible physiological regulatory mechanisms of the enzyme. Noradrenaline and the microsomal cytochrome P-450-dependent monooxygenase system were used to generate reduced oxygen species. When noradrenaline (greater than 0.1 mM) was incubated with rat liver microsomes in phosphate buffer (pH 7.4), an increase in microsomal glutathione S-transferase activity was observed, and this activation was potentiated in the presence of a NADPH-generating system; the glutathione S-transferase activity was increased to 180% of the control with 1 mM noradrenaline and to 400% with both noradrenaline and NADPH. Superoxide dismutase and catalase inhibited partially the noradrenaline-dependent activation of the enzyme. In the presence of dithiothreitol and glutathione, the activation of the glutathione S-transferase by noradrenaline, with or without NADPH, was not observed. In addition, the activation of glutathione S-transferase activity by noradrenaline and glutathione disulfide was not additive when both compounds were incubated together. These results indicate that the microsomal glutathione S-transferase is activated by reduced oxygen species, such as superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide. Thus, metabolic processes that generate high concentrations of reduced oxygen species may activate the microsomal glutathione S-transferase, presumably by the oxidation of the sulfhydryl group of the enzyme, and this increased catalytic activity may help protect cells from oxidant-induced damage.",

Subunit A and B proteins of DNA gyrase were partially purified from fluoroquinolone-susceptible strain SA113 and resistant isolate MS16405, which was 250- to 1,000-fold less susceptible to fluoroquinolones such as ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, ofloxacin, temafloxacin, and sparfloxacin than SA113 was. The supercoiling activity of the gyrase from SA113 was inhibited by the fluoroquinolones, and the 50% inhibitory concentrations of the drugs correlated well with their MICs. In contrast, the gyrase from MS16405 was insensitive to inhibition of supercoiling by all of the quinolones tested, even at 800 micrograms/ml. Combinations of heterologous gyrase subunits showed that subunit A from MS16405 conferred fluoroquinolone resistance, suggesting that an alteration in gyrase subunit A is a cause of the fluoroquinolone resistance in MS16405. Uptake of hydrophilic fluoroquinolones such as ciprofloxacin and norfloxacin by MS16405 was significantly lower than that by SA113. Furthermore, this difference was abolished by the addition of an energy inhibitor, carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, suggesting that an alteration in an energy-dependent process, such as an active efflux of hydrophilic quinolones, may lead to decreased drug uptake and hence to increased resistance to fluoroquinolones in MS16405. These findings suggest that the fluoroquinolone resistance in MS16405 is due mainly to an alteration in subunit A of DNA gyrase and may also be associated with an alteration in the drug uptake process.",

Besides AR antagonism, xanthines, including caffeine, have other biological actions: they inhibit phosphodiesterases (PDEs) (e.g., PDE1, PDE4, PDE5), promote calcium release from intracellular stores, and interfere with GABA-A receptors. Caffeine, through antagonism of ARs, affects brain functions such as sleep, cognition, learning, and memory, and modifies brain dysfunctions and diseases: Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Epilepsy, Pain/Migraine, Depression, Schizophrenia.

The right ventricular hypertrophy, fibrosis, and dysfunction were inhibited by captopril. However, captopril did not attenuate an increase in pulmonary artery pressure. MMP-2 and MMP-9 expressions and activities in right ventricles increased significantly in monocrotaline-injected rats and captopril inhibited them.

Furthermore, recent studies have suggested that NRIs may be useful for the treatment of several other psychiatric disorders. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the various effects of NRIs have not yet been sufficiently clarified. G-protein-activated inwardly rectifying K(+) (GIRK or Kir3) channels have an important function in regulating neuronal excitability and heart rate, and GIRK channel modulation has been suggested to be a potential treatment for several neuropsychiatric disorders and cardiac arrhythmias. In this study, we investigated the effects of atomoxetine and reboxetine on GIRK channels using the Xenopus oocyte expression assay. In oocytes injected with mRNA for GIRK1/GIRK2, GIRK2, or GIRK1/GIRK4 subunits, extracellular application of atomoxetine or reboxetine reversibly reduced GIRK currents. The inhibitory effects were concentration-dependent, but voltage-independent, and time-independent during each voltage pulse. However, Kir1.1 and Kir2.1 channels were insensitive to atomoxetine and reboxetine. Atomoxetine and reboxetine also inhibited GIRK currents induced by activation of cloned A(1) adenosine receptors or by intracellularly applied GTPgammaS, a nonhydrolyzable GTP analogue. Furthermore, the GIRK currents induced by ethanol were concentration-dependently inhibited by extracellularly applied atomoxetine but not by intracellularly applied atomoxetine. The present results suggest that atomoxetine and reboxetine inhibit brain- and cardiac-type GIRK channels, revealing a novel characteristic of clinically used NRIs. GIRK channel inhibition may contribute to some of the therapeutic effects of NRIs and adverse side effects related to nervous system and heart function.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) inhibitors represent a new class of oral antihyperglycemic agents. Sitagliptin is an orally active and selective DPP-IV inhibitor currently in Phase III development for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) properties and tolerability of multiple oral once-daily or twice-daily doses of sitagliptin. METHODS: This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled,incremental oral-dose study was conducted at SGS Biopharma, Antwerp, Belgium. Healthy, nonsmoking male volunteers aged 18 to 45 years with a creatinine clearance rate of &gt;80 mL/min and normoglycemia and weighing within 15% of their ideal height/weight range were randomly assigned to 1 of 8 treatment groups: sitagliptin 25, 50, 100, 200, or 400 mg or placebo, QD for 10 days; a single dose of sitagliptin 800 mg administered on day 1 followed by 600 mg QD on days 3 to 10; or sitagliptin 300 mg BID for 10 days. For analysis of PK properties, plasma and urine samples were obtained before study drug administration on day 1 and at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 16 hours after study drug administration on day 1; before study drug administration on days 2 to 9; and every 24 hours for 96 hours after the last dose on day 10, and analyzed for sitagliptin concentrations. Assays were used to measure inhibition of plasma DPP-IV activity and plasma concentrations of active and total glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), glucose, and glucagon, and serum concentrations of insulin, C-peptide, insulin-like growth factor-1, and insulin like growth factor binding protein-3. Tolerability was assessed throughout the study using physical examination, including vital sign measurements; 12-lead electrocardiography; and laboratory analysis, including hematology, biochemistry (hepatic aminotransferase and creatine phosphokinase), and urinalysis. RESULTS: Seventy subjects were enrolled (mean age, 32.9 years [range, 18-45 years]; mean weight, 79.7 kg [range, 63.4-97.7 kg]; 8 patients per sitagliptin study group and 14 patients in the control group). In the sitagliptin groups, the plasma concentration-time profiles and principal PK parameters (T(max), C(max), and t((1/2))) were statistically similar at days 1 (single dose) and 10 (steady state). In the groups receiving sitagliptin QD doses, accumulation of sitagliptin was modest (AUC accumulation ratio [day 10/day 1] range, 1.05-1.29), and the apparent terminal elimination t((1/2)) was 11.8 to 14.4 hours. At steady state in the sitagliptin QD groups, the mean proportion of drug excreted unchanged in the urine was approximately 70.6%. Dose-dependent inhibition of plasma DPP-IV activity was apparent, and the pattern of inhibition at steady state (day 10) was statistically similar to that observed on day 1. Day-10 weighted mean inhibition of plasma DPP-IV activity over 24 hours was &gt; or = 80% for doses of &gt; or = 50 mg QD. After a standard meal, active GLP-1 concentrations were significantly increased in the sitagliptin groups by approximately 2-fold compared with that in the control group, a finding consistent with near-maximal acute glucose lowering in preclinical studies. Across doses, no apparent adverse effects, including hypoglycemia, were found or reported. CONCLUSIONS: The results from this study in a select population of healthy male volunteers suggest that multiple oral doses of sitagliptin inhibited plasma DPP-IV activity and affected active GLP-1 concentrations in a dose-dependent manner, without producing hypoglycemia. Multiple dosing of sitagliptin exhibited a PK/PD profile consistent with that of a QD regimen and was well tolerated.",

        "abstract": "Calcium channel blockers are widely used antihypertensives. Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists are also used to treat hypertension and heart failure. We report here that a number of widely used dihydropyridine class calcium channel blockers are able to inhibit aldosterone-induced activation of mineralocorticoid receptor. These dihydropyridines varied in the extent of their effect on mineralocorticoid receptor, with nimodipine and felodipine the most potent and amlodipine the least. In contrast, both diltiazem and verapamil, nondihydropyridine calcium channel blockers, had no effect on mineralocorticoid receptor. These dihydropyridines compete with aldosterone for binding and block aldosterone-induced coactivator recruitment to mineralocorticoid receptor. The mineralocorticoid receptor S810L mutant, which is activated by steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist such as eplerenone, is inhibited by these drugs. Furthermore, nimodipine decreased aldosterone-induced expression of the mineralocorticoid receptor target gene epithelial sodium channel gamma subunit in adrenalectomized rats, demonstrating that dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers can function as mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists in vivo. Molecular modeling indicates that dihydropyridines dock into the ligand binding domain of mineralocorticoid receptor in a consensus pose that partially overlaps with steroidal mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists. Together, our data suggest that, in addition to their calcium channel blocking activity, a number of dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers also have mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist activity at high doses, a finding which may thus prove useful for the design of novel antihypertensive drugs in the future.",

        "abstract": "An improved sensitive, specific, precise and accurate assay of plasminogen in rat plasma was developed. It is performed in 96-well microtiter plates and can be completed within one hour. The assay is based on activation of plasminogen by human urokinase-type plasminogen activator (uPA) and simultaneous measurement of generated plasmin with the specific plasmin substrate H-D-Val-Phe-Lys-4-nitroanilide (S-2390), using purified native rat plasminogen for calibration. The concentration of S-2390 in the final reaction mixture during the whole reaction period is much greater than the Km value (approximately 20 microM) for rat plasmin-cleavage of S-2390 ensuring that hydrolysis of substrate follows zero order kinetics and that the substrate produces a 20-35 fold decrease in rate of inhibition of plasmin by its target inhibitors in plasma. Analogous to the human system the target plasma inhibitors of rat plasmin are shown to be plasmin inhibitor and alpha-macroglobulins. Tranexamic acid (0.8 mM) is incorporated in the reaction mixture resulting in a 19-fold increase in the rate of plasminogen activation and presumably an about 50-fold decrease in the rate of inhibition of generated plasmin by plasmin inhibitor. The assay is suitable for accurate measurement of plasminogen in samples obtained from animals containing pharmacological concentrations of uPA or tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) in their plasma when in vitro plasminogen activation is blocked at pH 5 by collecting blood in acidic anticoagulant. Judged from in vitro experiments formation of catalytic active plasmin-alpha-macroglobulin complexes during massive activation of plasminogen in vivo does not interfere with the assay.",

HSVTK-transformed baby hamster kidney cells treated with GCV, PCV or ACV were monitored for growth by viable count, and for death by TUNEL assay, propidium iodide staining, detection of phosphatidyl serine translocation and detection of DNA laddering. All compounds delayed growth or reduced viability of HSVTK-transformed cells. Drug treatment reduced levels of cyclin B1 message (which normally peaks in G2/M-phase of the cell cycle) and induced a four- to fivefold upregulation of GADD45 message. Treatment with GCV or PCV induced rapid accumulation of cells in S-phase and apoptotic death. Treatment with ACV, however, was associated with sustained S-phase arrest. GCV (and to a lesser extent PCV) increased phosphatidyl serine translocation, induced positive TUNEL results with alterations in cell morphology, caused marked propidium iodide staining and induced DNA laddering. By contrast, up to 7 days' exposure to ACV did not induce DNA laddering, with very little TUNEL staining. ACV treatment had little effect on phosphatidyl serine translocation and propidium iodide staining was markedly reduced compared with treatment with the other compounds. Thus, by all criteria, GCV was the most potent inducer of cell death. The current theories regarding apoptosis or necrosis as the preferred form of cell death in prodrug gene therapy are considered and the suitability of PCV or ACV as potential alternatives to GCV in the HSVTK system is discussed.",

        "abstract": "Sex hormones are known to interfere with the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) in two ways. First, estrogens strongly stimulate the production of renin substrate (angiotensinogen), leading to increased levels of angiotensin and aldosterone, and sodium retention. Second, progesterone is a potent aldosterone antagonist, which acts on the mineralocorticoid receptor to prevent sodium retention. In combined oral contraceptives, progestogens devoid of antimineralocorticoid and antiandrogenic activity are unable to counteract the sodium-retaining effect of the ethinylestradiol component. As a consequence, these preparations may increase fluid retention, and promote related symptoms such as edema and body weight. Drospirenone is a new progestogen with antimineralocorticoid and antiandrogenic activity. The relationship between the progestogenie and antimincralocorticoid potency of drospirenone is similar to that of endogenous progesterone. At a dosage that suppresses ovulation, drospirenone induces mild natriuresis, which is followed by compensatory stimulation of the RAAS (comparable to a low sodium diet). An oral contraceptive containing 3 mg drospirenone and 30 microg ethinylestradiol. (Yasmin, Schering AG, Berlin, Germany) provides reliable contraception and, due to a lack of sodium retention, may counteract cyclical weight gain and other symptoms related to estrogen-induced fluid retention.",

Pretreatment of human foreskin fibroblasts with VPA (0.125-1mM) caused a concentration-dependent increase of HCMV immediate early and antigen late antigen expression. Structure-activity relationships of VPA derivatives for HCMV stimulation were compared to those for teratogenic action and those for HDAC inhibition. Side chain elongation and introduction of a triple bond in 4-position of the other chain caused teratogenicity, stimulated HCMV replication, and increased HDAC inhibition, as demonstrated by enhanced levels of acetylated histones. Teratogenic VPA derivatives with a branched chain in 3-position as well as a non-teratogenic anticonvulsive active VPA derivative did not stimulate HCMV or accumulation of acetylated histones.

        "abstract": "DNA damage is accepted as a consequence of thymidylate deprivation induced by chemotherapeutic inhibitors of thymidylate synthase (TS), but the types of damage and signaling responses remain incompletely understood. Thymidylate deprivation increases dUTP and uracil in DNA, which is removed by base excision repair (BER). Because BER requires a synthesis step, strand break intermediates presumably accumulate. Thymidylate deprivation also induces cell cycle arrest during replication. Homologous recombination (HR) is a means of repairing persistent BER intermediates and collapsed replication forks. There are also intimate links between HR and S-phase checkpoint pathways. In this study, the goals were to determine the involvement of HR-associated proteins and DNA damage signaling responses to thymidylate deprivation. When RAD51, which is a central component of HR, was depleted by siRNA cells were sensitized to raltitrexed (RTX), which specifically inhibits TS. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration in mammalian cells that depletion of RAD51 causes sensitivity to thymidylate deprivation. Activation of DNA damage signaling responses was examined following treatment with RTX. Phosphorylation of replication protein A (RPA2 subunit) and formation of damage-induced foci were strikingly evident following IC(50) doses of RTX. Induction was much more striking following RTX treatment than with hydroxyurea, which is commonly used to inhibit replication. RTX treatment also induced foci of RAD51, gamma-H2AX, phospho-Chk1, and phospho-NBS1, although the extent of co-localization with RPA2 foci varied. Collectively, the results suggest that HR and S-phase checkpoint signaling processes are invoked by thymidylate deprivation and influence cellular resistance to thymidylate deprivation.",

        "abstract": "The importance of mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonists in the treatment of cardiovascular disease has been emphasised by two recent clinical trials, one using spironolactone and the other using a new selective MR antagonist, namely eplerenone. Eplerenone has a very low affinity for the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). Determinants of binding specificity of eplerenone to the MR were investigated using chimeras created between the ligand-binding domains (LBD) of the MR and the GR. These chimeras had been used previously to investigate aldosterone and spironolactone binding specificity to the MR. Eplerenone competed strongly for [(3)H]-dexamethasone binding to a MR/GR chimera containing amino acids 804-874 of the MR and weakly to a chimera containing amino acids 672-803 of the MR. Within the 804-874 region, eplerenone competed for [(3)H]-dexamethasone binding to a chimera containing amino acids 820-844 of the MR, although the calculated affinity was approximately 10-fold lower than for binding to the full-length MR LBD. Similar results were obtained using another MR antagonist, namely spironolactone. Modelling of eplerenone binding to the MR LBD, based on the GR LBD crystal structure, suggests that amino acids 820-844 affect the overall shape of the ligand-binding pocket and that eplerenone acts as an MR antagonist because it fails to stabilize the active conformation of the receptor. In contrast with results with the MR antagonists eplerenone and spironolactone, amino acids 820-844 are sufficient in themselves to confer high-affinity aldosterone binding to the MR, suggesting that the binding determinants of the two antagonists are similar to each other but differ from those of aldosterone.",

NQO1 binds and stabilizes several short-lived proteins including the tumor suppressors p53 and p73 and the enzyme ornithine decarboxylase (ODC). Dicoumarol is a widely used potent competitive inhibitor of NQO1 enzymatic activity, which competes with NAD(P)H for binding to NQO1. Dicoumarol also disrupts the binding of NQO1 to p53, p73, and ODC and induces their ubiquitin-independent proteasomal degradation. We report here the crystal structure of human NQO1 in complex with dicoumarol at 2.75 A resolution. We have identified the interactions of dicoumarol with the different residues of NQO1 and the conformational changes imposed upon dicoumarol binding. The most prominent conformational changes that occur in the presence of dicoumarol involve Tyr 128 and Phe 232 that are present on the surface of the NQO1 catalytic pocket. On the basis of the comparison of the NQO1 structure in complex with different NQO1 inhibitors and our previous analysis of NQO1 mutants, we propose that the specific conformation of Tyr 128 and Phe 232 is important for NQO1 interaction with p53 and other client proteins.",

Using a high-throughput screening assay based on acetylation-dependent gene expression, we identified CBZ as a candidate and proceeded to characterize its effects on HDAC. CBZ induced acetylation of histone H4 in the HepG2 liver carcinoma cell line. CBZ inhibited HDAC 3 and HDAC 7, which are representatives of HDAC class I and II respectively. Quantitative testing in an in vitro assay demonstrated HDAC inhibition with an IC50 of 2 microM. The major active metabolite of CBZ, CBZ-10,11-epoxide, was found to have the same HDAC inhibitory activity. The IC50 is considerably lower than therapeutic plasma levels that are typically achieved in patients (25-51 microM). CBZ shares important clinical characteristics (teratogenicity, activity as a mood stabilizer) with valproic acid, another AED that was recently identified as an inhibitor of HDAC.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Histone deacetylase (HDAC), a host mediator of gene repression, inhibits HIV gene expression and virus production and may contribute to quiescence of HIV within resting CD4 T cells. OBJECTIVES: To test the ability of valproic acid (VPA), an inhibitor of HDAC in clinical use, to induce expression of HIV from resting CD4 T cells. METHODS: Chromatin immunoprecipitation measured the capability of VPA to deacetylate the HIV promoter, a remodeling of chromatin linked to gene expression. The effect of VPA on resting CD4 T cell phenotype was measured by flow cytometric analysis, and its effect on de novo HIV infection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells was measured ex vivo. Outgrowth of HIV from resting CD4 T cells of aviremic, HIV-infected donors treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy was compared in limiting-dilution cultures after mitogen stimulation or exposure to VPA. RESULTS: VPA induced acetylation at the integrated HIV proviral promoter, but CD4 cells exposed to VPA did not become activated or more permissive for de novo HIV infection. VPA induced outgrowth of HIV from the resting CD4 cells of aviremic patients at concentrations achievable in vivo as frequently as did mitogen stimulation. CONCLUSIONS: With advances in antiretroviral therapy, HIV infection might be cleared by intensive time-limited treatment coupled with practical strategies that disrupt latency without enhancing new infection. HDAC inhibitors are capable of inducing expression of quiescent provirus, without fully activating cells or enhancing de novo infection, and may be useful in future clinical protocols that seek to eradicate HIV infection.",

        "abstract": "Valproic acid (VPA), used to treat bipolar mood disorder and seizures, also inhibits histone deacetylase (HDAC). Here, we found that VPA and other HDAC inhibitors, butyrate and trichostatin A, robustly protected mature cerebellar granule cell cultures from excitotoxicity induced by SYM 2081 ((2S, 4R)-4-methylglutamate), an inhibitor of excitatory amino-acid transporters and an agonist of low-affinity kainate receptors. These neuroprotective effects required protracted treatment and were correlated with enhanced acetylated histone levels, indicating HDAC inhibition. SYM-induced excitotoxicity was blocked by MK-801 ((5R,10S)-(+)-5-methyl-10,11-dihydro-5H-dibenzo[a,d]cyclohepten-5,10-imine hydrogen maleate), supporting that the toxicity was largely N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor dependent. SYM excitotoxicity had apoptotic characteristics and was prevented by a caspase inhibitor. SYM-induced apoptosis was associated with a rapid and robust nuclear accumulation of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), a housekeeping gene previously shown to be proapoptotic. VPA pretreatment suppressed SYM 2081-induced GAPDH nuclear accumulation, concurrent with its neuroprotective effects. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) revealed that GAPDH is copresent with acetylated histone H3, including Lys9-acetylated histone, and that VPA treatment caused a time-dependent decrease in the levels of nuclear GAPDH with a concomitant increase in acetylated histones in the ChIP complex. Our results strongly suggest that VPA protects neurons from excitotoxicity through inhibition of HDAC activity and that this protective effect may involve suppression of excitotoxicity-induced accumulation of GAPDH protein in the nucleus.",

Acute BIP-1 (0.25-4mg/kg) pretreatment reduced the quipazine-induced head twitches in mice and produced antidepressant-like effects in mouse forced swim and tail suspension tests. BIP-1 reversed the depressogenic-like effects of meta-chlorophenyl piperazine and augmented the antidepressant-like effects of amitryptiline and harmane. Chronic (14days) treatment with BIP-1 (1 and 2mg/kg) or amitriptyline (10mg/kg) alleviated the behavioural anomalies of olfactory bulbectomised rats in modified open field exploration, social interaction, hyperemotionality and sucrose preference paradigms. When BIP-1 treatment was combined with amitryptyline, a short duration regimen (7days) was sufficient to reverse the bulbectomy induced anomalies. This investigation revealed that 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonism is the principal mechanism behind the antidepressant-like effects of BIP-1. Finally, we propound the combination of 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonists and tricyclic antidepressants as a likely strategy to achieve an early-onset of antidepressant action.",

Tolcapone potentiates and prolongs the effect of levodopa in the central nervous system (CNS) by enhancing levodopa's delivery to the CNS and slowing dopamine's central metabolism. A short terminal disposition half-life of 2 hours mandates dosing 3 times/day. Dosage adjustment is generally unnecessary in the presence of mild to moderate renal and hepatic impairment. Coadministration of tolcapone with levodopa-DDI results in significant amelioration of the wearing-off and on-off phenomena and frequently allows significant levodopa dosage reduction. In patients with stable disease, tolcapone improves \"on\" time. As might be expected from its potentiation of levodopa effects, dopaminergic side effects are prominent with this agent. Although the main objective of drug treatment in Parkinson's disease remains clinical improvement with an optimum dose and frequency of levodopa administration, tolcapone may prove a useful adjunct to such therapy, especially in the presence of the wearing-off and on-off phenomena. The relative merits of this agent vis-a-vis dopamine receptor agonists are somewhat unclear at present.

        "abstract": "Two important ingredients of personal care products, namely polycyclic musk fragrances and UV filters, can be found in the environment and in humans. In previous studies, several compounds of both classes have been tested for their interaction with the estrogen receptor. Two polycyclic musk fragrances, namely AHTN and HHCB, turned out to be anti-estrogenic both in vitro and in vivo in a transgenic zebrafish assay. Several UV filters have been shown to exert estrogenic effects in vitro and in some in vivo studies. Here, we assessed the interaction of five polycyclic musk compounds and seven UV filters with the estrogen receptor (ER), androgen receptor (AR), and progesterone (PR) receptor, using sensitive and specific reporter gene cell lines. Four polycyclic musks (AHTN, HHCB, AETT, and AHMI) were found to be antagonists toward the ERbeta, AR and PR. The UV filters that showed estrogenic effects (benzophenone-3, Bp-3; 3-benzylidene camphor, 3-BC; homosalate, HMS; and 4-methylbenzylidene camphor, 4-MBC) were found to be antagonists toward the AR and PR. The ERalpha agonistic UV filter octyl-dimethyl-p-aminobenzoic acid (OD-PABA) did not show activity toward the AR and PR. Octyl methoxy cinnamate (OMC) showed weak ERalpha agonism, but potent PR antagonism. Butyl methoxydibenzoylmethane (B-MDM) only showed weak ERalpha agonism and weak AR antagonism. Most effects were observed at relatively high concentrations (above 1 muM); however, the anti-progestagenic effects of the polycyclic musks AHMI and AHTN were detected at concentrations as low as 0.01 muM. The activity of anti-progestagenic xenobiotics at low concentrations indicates the need to undertake more research to find out about the potential endocrine disrupting effects of these compounds in vivo.",

Under the conditions studied, both 5-Cl-PZA and PZA exhibited concentration and substrate dependence consistent with competitive inhibition of FASI with K(i)s of 55 to 59 microM and 2,567 to 2,627 microM, respectively.

Body weight was measured at baseline and weekly thereafter. Clinical rating scales were completed at baseline and at week 6. All participants gained weight (mean weight gain 3.1+/-0.9 kg) and a similar pattern of weight gain was observed: an increase during the first 2 weeks and no additional weight gain (two patients) or minor weight loss (one patient) from weeks 3 to 6. None gained 7% of baseline weight, which is the cut-off for clinically significant weight gain. Betahistine was safe and well tolerated and did not interfere with the antipsychotic effect of olanzapine.

Considering the similar NMDAR activity of ketamine and d-methadone and the rapid and robust antidepressant effects of ketamine, we compared these 2 drugs in the forced swim test in Sprague-Dawley rats, which has been shown to be predictive of antidepressant activity for drugs with different mechanisms of action including ketamine. This study evaluated the antidepressant-like effect of d-methadone (10, 20, and 40 mg/kg) in the forced swim test 24 hr following a single-dose administration. At all doses, d-methadone significantly (p &lt; .05) decreased immobility of rats compared with vehicle, suggesting antidepressant-like activity. In addition, the effect of d-methadone (20 and 40 mg/kg) on immobility was greater than the effect seen with ketamine (10 mg/kg). Importantly, there were no changes in locomotor activity of rats that could have confounded the immobility effects at all doses (10, 20, and 40 mg/kg) of d-methadone. This is the first demonstration that the NMDAR antagonist, d-methadone, exerts antidepressant-like activity in a preclinical animal model and that its efficacy is similar to or even stronger than that of ketamine, an antidepressant that demonstrates a rapid onset activity and robust efficacy in patients with treatment-resistant depression. d-Methadone is currently being evaluated in a Phase 2a clinical study for patients with treatment-resistant depression and could potentially represent a new effective antidepressant in the growing class of NMDAR antagonists.

        "title": "[Metabolism, structure and biological activity of sex steroids].",
        "abstract": "Recently, the action of steroid hormones are interpreted as the results from the interaction with its proper receptors. However, every steroid hormones and steroid drugs have many biological effects, and if one steroid receptor is enough to result in these multiple effects or not is not well known. On the other hand, our experimental results showed that some steroid drugs are metabolized, in vivo, to form several biologically active compounds. Norethindrone, a representative progestational compound, has also some estrogenic and androgenic effects. It was demonstrated, in our laboratory, that the compound was converted, in vivo, to several androgens and to estrogen, ethynyl estradiol. Since it was demonstrated later that ethynyl estradiol but not norethindrone showed estrogenic activity in vitro, it can be concluded that the estrogenic activity of norethindrone was derived from the metabolite of norethindrone, ethynyl estradiol. Although the chemical structure of norethindrone is far different from that of progesterone, it was demonstrated that the progestational effect of norethindrone was derived from the interaction of norethindrone with progesterone receptor. The binding site of norethindrone with the receptor is identical with that of progesterone. Some steroid drugs, such as lynestrenol are inactive, per se, and the conversion of the compound into norethindrone in liver tissue well explained the progestational activity of the compound. In such cases, the studies on the interaction of original compound with receptor in target tissues will give us poor information on the mechanism of steroid action. Some progestational compounds such as medroxyprogesterone acetate has anticancer effect, but norethindrone and the related compounds have no such an effect. This indicates that the receptor for anticancer effect is different from the receptor for common progestational effect. This was confirmed by many ways and the receptor for anticancer effect was partially characterized. Although dydrogesterone is a potent progestational agent and the endometrial response to this compound is almost identical with that to progesterone, it results in neither the elevation of basal body temperature nor an inhibition of ovulation, which are commonly observed with other progestogens. This also raises a doubt on the identity of progesterone receptors in peripheral and central tissues.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

        "title": "How and why aztreonam works.",
        "abstract": "Aztreonam is the first monocyclic beta-lactam antibiotic (monobactam) to be tested clinically. Its synthetic structure determines specific areas of activity, including enhanced activity against Pseudomonas species, exceptional activity against gram-negative bacteria, stability to beta-lactamases and lack of activity against gram-positive bacteria--all of which can be directly related to its chemical composition. Aztreonam has a high affinity for the protein-binding protein 3 (PBP-3) of aerobic gram-negative bacteria. Most of these organisms are inhibited and killed at low concentrations of the drug. Aztreonam binds poorly to PBP sites of the aerobic gram-positive and anaerobic bacteria and consequently has relatively poor inhibitory effects against these bacteria. In vitro, minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) values against almost all of the Enterobacteriaceae and against Neisseria and Haemophilus strains are typically below 1 microgram per milliliter. MIC values against Pseudomonas aeruginosa of 8 micrograms per milliliter are comparable with those of other antipseudomonal beta-lactams and the acylureidopenicillins. As combination therapy with amino-glycosides, aztreonam acts in synergy against P. aeruginosa, Acinetobacter and gentamicin-resistant gram-negative rods. Aztreonam is widely distributed in the body tissues and fluids, and the average elimination half-life is 1.7 hours. Intramuscular dosing results in peak serum levels in approximately one hour, while intravenous dosing results in peak levels within five minutes. After a 2 gram dose given intravenously, MIC90 values for most of the Enterobacteriaceae are exceeded for eight hours, and those for P. aeruginosa, for almost six hours. The steady-state volume of distribution is approximately 0.18 liter per kilogram. Concentrations above the MIC90 for most gram-negative bacteria are also present within bone, prostate and cerebrospinal fluid. Between 60 and 70 per cent of the drug is excreted unchanged in the urine, resulting in concentrations approximating 3,000 micrograms per milliliter two hours after a 1 gram dose given intravenously. Serum clearance of aztreonam is directly proportional to creatinine clearance. Dosage adjustment must, therefore, be made in the presence of reduced clearance. Dosing varies between 0.5 and 2.0 grams every six to 12 hours, depending on the severity of the infection. The characteristics of aztreonam suggest that it is a useful nonnephrotoxic drug for treatment of aerobic gram-negative infection.",

        "abstract": "We used a whole cell patch clamp technique to study the effects of ropivacaine on rat dorsal horn neurons. Under voltage clamp, ropivacaine (10-400 microM) produced a dose-dependent inhibition of sodium current. From a holding potential (V(h)) of -80 mV, sodium currents evoked by test pulses to 0 mV were inhibited by ropivacaine with a mean drug concentration required to produce 50% current inhibition (IC(50)) value of 117.3 microM, which was more than the value of the bupivacaine (IC(50) 53.7 microM). The inhibition effect of ropivacaine was also voltage-dependent. Current evoked from a V(h) of -60 mV was inhibited by ropivacaine with a mean IC(50) value of 74.3 microM, which was less than that obtained at the V(h) of -80 mV. The inhibition effect of ropivacaine on sodium current was use dependent. Repeated activation by a train of depolarizing pulses (5 Hz, 20 ms) increased the inhibitory effects of ropivacaine. The ratio amplitudes of the 20th to the first pulse were 91.2% and 71.1%, respectively, in the absence and presence of ropivacaine (50 microM). Ropivacaine also produced a significant hyperpolarizing shift of 11 mV in the steady-state inactivation curve of sodium current. The inhibition of ropivacaine on the sodium channel may contribute to the mechanism of action of local anesthetics during epidural and spinal anesthesia.",

Both single (37.5 and 75 mg/kg) and long-term (75 mg/kg/day, 14 days i.p.) theophylline treatments exerted antinociceptive effect by increasing the mechanical pain threshold. Single treatment of theophylline (75 mg/kg) antagonized the antinociceptive effect of CPA (0.1 mg/kg); CPA (0.1 mg/kg) abolished the theophylline-induced antinociception. Chronic treatment with theophylline did not change the antinociceptive effect of CPA, while CPA decreased the theophylline antinociception. Yohimbine (0.5 mg/kg), an a 2-adrenoceptor antagonist, diminished the antinociception of a single dose (75 mg/kg) of theophylline, whereas prazocin, an a 1-adrenoceptor antagonist, did not affect it.

        "abstract": "Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are orphan nuclear hormone receptors that are known to control the expression of genes that are involved in lipid homeostasis and energy balance. PPARs activate gene transcription in response to a variety of compounds, including hypolipidemic drugs. Most of these compounds have high affinity to the ligand-binding domain (LBD) of PPARs and cause a conformational change within PPARs. As a result, the receptor is converted to an activated mode that promotes the recruitment of co-activators such as the steroid receptor co-activator-1 (SRC-1). Based on the activation mechanism of PPARs (the ligand binding to PPAR gamma induces interactions of the receptor with transcriptional co-activators), we performed Western blot and ELISA. These showed that the indomethacin, a PPAR gamma ligand, increased the binding between PPAR gamma and SRC-1 in a ligand dose-dependent manner. These results suggested that the in vitro conformational change of PPAR gamma by ligands was also induced, and increased the levels of the ligand-dependent interaction with SRC-1. Collectively, we developed a novel and useful ELISA system for the mass screening of PPAR gamma ligands. This screening system (based on the interaction between PPAR gamma and SRC-1) may be a promising system in the development of drugs for metabolic disorders.",

In this paper the effect of L-xylo-AsA, D-xylo-AsA, L-arabo-AsA and D-arabo-AsA on the activity of dopamine beta-hydroxylase was studied to clarify whether or not the structural specificities of these stereoisomers have different effects on enzyme activity. The maximum velocity (Vmax) of the hydroxylation and Km for ascorbic acid were calculated using double-reciprocal plotting. Vmax for L-xylo-AsA was estimated to be 201 nmol/min/mg protein and those of D-xylo-AsA, L-arabo-AsA and D-arabo-AsA were 157 nmol/min/mg protein, 112 nmol/min/mg protein and 194 nmol/min/mg protein, respectively.

However, the use of antithyroid drugs is associated with immunomodulatory effects, and recent studies with thionamide-related heterocyclic thioderivates demonstrated direct anti-inflammatory and immunosuppressive properties. Using primary human T-lymphocytes, we show that the heterocyclic thionamides carbimazole and propylthiouracil inhibit synthesis of the proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor (TNF)alpha and interferon (IFN)gamma. In addition, DNA binding of nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB, a proinflammatory transcription factor that regulates both TNFalpha and IFNgamma synthesis, and NF-kappaB-dependent reporter gene expression were reduced. Abrogation of NF-kappaB activity was accompanied by reduced phosphorylation and proteolytic degradation of inhibitor of kappaB (IkappaB)alpha, the inhibitory subunit of the NF-kappaB complex. Carbimazole inhibited NF-kappaB via the small GTPase Rac-1, whereas propylthiouracil inhibited the phosphorylation of IkappaBalpha by its kinase inhibitor of kappaB kinase alpha. Methimazole had no effect on NF-kappaB induction, demonstrating that drug potency correlated with the chemical reactivity of the thionamide-associated sulfur group. Taken together, our data demonstrate that thioureylenes with a common, heterocyclic structure inhibit inflammation and immune function via the NF-kappaB pathway. Our results may explain the observed remission of proinflammatory diseases upon antithyroid therapy in hyperthyroid patients. The use of related thioureylenes may provide a new therapeutic basis for the development and application of anti-inflammatory compounds.",

In addition, select adenosine receptor antagonists N-(4-acetylphenyl)-2-[4-(2,3,6,7-tetrahydro-2,6 dioxo-1,3-dipropyl-1H-purin-8-yl)phenoxy]acetamide (MRS 1706), 8-[4-[((4-Cyano[2,6-]-phenyl)carbamoylmethyl)oxy]phenyl]-1,3-di(n-propyl)-xanthine (MRS 1754), 1,3-Diethyl-8-phenylxanthine (DPCPX), 1,3-Diethyl-8-phenylxanthine (DPX), Alloxazine, 8-(3-Chlorostyryl)caffeine (CSC), and Theophylline blocked the NECA-induced calcium responses. Additionally, NECA, CPCA, and adenosine stimulated cAMP formation with a rank order of potency characteristic of adenosine A2B receptors. The select adenosine A2A antagonist, 5-amino-7-(phenylethyl)-2-(2-furyl)-pyrazolo[4,3-e]-1,2,4-triazolo[1,5-c] pyrimidine (SCH 58261) failed to antagonize the NECA response, whereas the potent and highly selective adenosine A2B antagonists MRS 1754 and MRS 1706 inhibited NECA-stimulated cAMP production. Lastly, NECA-induced interleukin-8 secretion was inhibited by MRS 1754. Taken together, these data indicate that [Ca2+]i accumulation and cAMP production as well as interleukin-8 secretion is mediated through the adenosine A2B receptor in the T24 cell line.",

        "abstract": "Quinones represent a very important class of compounds found in nature and for the chemically synthesized drugs. The present study was designed to elucidate the intestinal first pass metabolic pathways in vivo and in vitro, of tanshinone IIA (TS), a derivative of phenanthrene-quinone isolated from Salvia miltiorrhiza. Five metabolites, proposed to be TS catechol glucuronides (two position isomers), dehydrotanshinone IIA and its two catechol glucuronides, were identified from the rat intestinal homogenates after oral administration of TS. TS metabolism was further conducted in the subcellular system including cytosol, microsomes, mitochondrial and S9 under both phase I and phase II metabolic conditions. TS underwent negligible metabolism in all of the subcellular systems under phase I metabolic condition using NADPH as the cofactor. However, significant and substantial metabolic elimination of TS was observed in the cytosol and S9 fractions, while not in the microsomes fractions, when both NADPH and UDPGA were added. Two TS catechol glucuronides were identified from such an in vitro metabolic medium. Dicoumarol, a specific inhibitor of the NAD(P)H dependent quinone oxidoreductase (NQO1), significantly inhibited the metabolic elimination of TS in a noncompetitive way, suggesting that NQO1 was responsible for the quinone reduction of TS to form the catechol intermediate. The catechol intermediate failed to be detected directly was proved to be highly unstable and autoxidized back to TS accompanied with hydrogen peroxide generation. Dicoumarol exhibited a significant inhibitory effect on the hydrogen peroxide generation, further supporting that the reduction of TS was catalyzed by NQO1. The absolute bioavailability of TS was significantly enhanced by oral dicoumarol pretreatment. In conclusion, a novel intestinal metabolic pathway for quinones, NQO1 mediated reduction and subsequent glucuronidation, was determined using TS as a model compound. This study should be helpful for the general understanding of quinones absorption and intestinal first pass metabolism.",

        "abstract": "This study examined the antinociceptive (analgesic) efficacy of hydromorphone and hydromorphone-induced tolerance and regulation of mu-opioid receptor density. Initially s.c. hydromorphone's time of peak analgesic (tail-flick) effect (45 min) and ED50 using standard and cumulative dosing protocols (0.22 mg/kg, 0.37 mg/kg, respectively) were determined. The apparent analgesic efficacy (tau) of hydromorphone was then estimated using the operational model of agonism and the irreversible mu-opioid receptor antagonist clocinnamox. Mice were injected with clocinnamox (0.32-25.6 mg/kg, i.p.) and 24 h later, the analgesic potency of hydromorphone was determined. The tau value for hydromorphone was 35, which suggested that hydromorphone is a lower analgesic efficacy opioid agonist. To examine hydromorphone-induced tolerance, mice were continuously infused s.c. with hydromorphone (2.1-31.5 mg/kg/day) for 7 days and then morphine cumulative dose response studies were performed. Other groups of mice were injected with hydromorphone (2.2-22 mg/kg/day) once, or intermittently every 24 h for 7 days. Twenty-four hours after the last injection, mice were tested using morphine cumulative dosing studies. There was more tolerance with infusion treatments compared to intermittent treatment. When compared to higher analgesic efficacy opioids, hydromorphone infusions induced substantially more tolerance. Finally, the effect of chronic infusion (31.5 mg/kg/day) and 7 day intermittent (22 mg/kg/day) hydromorphone treatment on spinal cord mu-opioid receptor density was determined. Hydromorphone did not produce any change in mu-opioid receptor density following either treatment. These results support suggestions that analgesic efficacy is correlated with tolerance magnitude and regulation of mu-opioid receptors when opioid agonists are continuously administered. Taken together, these studies indicate that analgesic efficacy and treatment protocol are important in determining tolerance and regulation of mu-opioid receptors.",

        "abstract": "A model incubation system containing purified thyroid peroxidase (TPO) was used to study the mechanism of action of the thioureylene anti-thyroid drugs--propylthiouracil (PTU), methylmercapto imidazole (MMI) and carbimazole. Two general types of experiments were performed: a) measurement of the inhibitory effects of the drugs on TPO-catalyzed iodination and on TPO-catalyzed oxidation of guaiacol, and b) studies of the metabolism of PTU and MMI by the TPO model system. The major observations can be summarized as follows: 1) The thioureylene drugs are potent inhibitors of TPO-catalyzed iodination of protein and tyrosine. Their potency increases greatly as the concentration of I- decreases. 2) The thioureylene drugs are also potent inhibitors of TPO-catalyzed oxidation of guaiacol, a reaction that does not involve iodide. 3) MMI and PTU are readily oxidized in the model incubation system when iodide is present but not in the absence of iodide. The rate of oxidation increased as the iodide concentration was increased from 10 to 100 muM. 4) Oxidation of PTU and MMI by the model incubation system is inhibited by relatively slight increases in the concentration of PTU and MMI. These drugs are capable of inhibiting their own and each other's metabolism. 5) Inhibition of iodination is competitively antagonized by iodide at low drug concentrations, but not at higher drug concentrations. 6) Inhibition of iodination by MMI and PTU may be either reversible (low ratio of drug to iodide), or irreversible (higher ratio of drug to iodide). In reversible inhibition the iodination is inhibited for a period which may be as brief as 2 min or as long as 20 min, but thereafter, iodination begins, and there is escape from inhibition. During the lag-period there is extensive metabolism of the drug. In the case of irreversible inhibition of iodination is inhibited completely or almost completely for 60 min, and drug oxidation during this period is relatively low. 7) Irreversible inhibition may be transformed into reversible inhibition by increasing the concentration of TPO or the concentration of iodide. However, increasing the concentration of H2O2 or of tyrosine does not overcome irreversible inhibition. On the basis of these findings and of current views concerning the mechanism of enzymatic iodination, a scheme is proposed for the mechanism of inhibition by thioureylene drugs of TPO-catalyzed iodination of protein and tyrosine.",

[3H]-spiperone competition binding assays showed that A-381393 potently bound to membrane from cells expressing recombinant human dopamine D4.4 receptor (Ki=1.5 nM), which was 20-fold higher than that of clozapine (Ki=30.4 nM). A-381393 exhibited highly selective binding for the dopamine D4.4 receptor (&gt;2700-fold) when compared to D1, D2, D3 and D5 dopamine receptors. Furthermore, in comparison to clozapine and L-745870, A-381393 exhibits better receptor selectivity, showing no affinity up to 10 microM for a panel of more than 70 receptors and channels, with the exception of moderate affinity for 5-HT2A (Ki=370 nM). A-381393 potently inhibited the functional activity of agonist-induced GTP-gamma-S binding assay and 1 microM dopamine induced-Ca2+ flux in human dopamine D4.4 receptor expressing cells, but not in human dopamine D2L or D3 receptor cells. In contrast to L-745870, A-381393 did not exhibit any significant intrinsic activity in a D4.4 receptor. In vivo, A-381393 has good brain penetration after subcutaneous administration. A-381393 inhibited penile erection induced by the selective D4 agonist PD168077 in conscious rats. Thus, A-381393 is a novel selective D4 antagonist that will enhance the ability to study dopamine D4 receptors both in vitro and in vivo.",

        "title": "Cannabidiol is a negative allosteric modulator of the cannabinoid CB1 receptor.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cannabidiol has been reported to act as an antagonist at cannabinoid CB1 receptors. We hypothesized that cannabidiol would inhibit cannabinoid agonist activity through negative allosteric modulation of CB1 receptors. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Internalization of CB1 receptors, arrestin2 recruitment, and PLCbeta3 and ERK1/2 phosphorylation, were quantified in HEK 293A cells heterologously expressing CB1 receptors and in the STHdh(Q7/Q7) cell model of striatal neurons endogenously expressing CB1 receptors. Cells were treated with 2-arachidonylglycerol or Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol alone and in combination with different concentrations of cannabidiol. KEY RESULTS: Cannabidiol reduced the efficacy and potency of 2-arachidonylglycerol and Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol on PLCbeta3- and ERK1/2-dependent signalling in cells heterologously (HEK 293A) or endogenously (STHdh(Q7/Q7)) expressing CB1 receptors. By reducing arrestin2 recruitment to CB1 receptors, cannabidiol treatment prevented internalization of these receptors. The allosteric activity of cannabidiol depended upon polar residues being present at positions 98 and 107 in the extracellular amino terminus of the CB1 receptor. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Cannabidiol behaved as a non-competitive negative allosteric modulator of CB1 receptors. Allosteric modulation, in conjunction with effects not mediated by CB1 receptors, may explain the in vivo effects of cannabidiol. Allosteric modulators of CB1 receptors have the potential to treat CNS and peripheral disorders while avoiding the adverse effects associated with orthosteric agonism or antagonism of these receptors.",

        "abstract": "Aminoglutethimide is a clinically available drug that suppresses steroid biosynthesis by inhibiting enzymes such as cytochrome P450scc and aromatase. Because several members of neurosteroids regulate glutamate receptors, we investigated the effect of aminoglutethimide on cell death induced by overactivation of glutamate receptors in CNS neurons. Long-term pretreatment of organotypic cerebrocortical slice cultures with aminoglutethimide (100-1000 microM) for 6 days or over resulted in concentration-dependent suppression of neuronal cell death induced by NMDA. Aminoglutethimide (1000 microM) also inhibited neurotoxicity of AMPA and kainate, but not of ionomycin or staurosporine. The protective effect of aminoglutethimide against NMDA cytotoxicity was not mimicked by other steroid synthesis inhibitors including trilostane and exemestane, and was not reversed by concurrent application of steroids such as pregnenolone, estrone, 17beta-estradiol and estriol. In dissociated rat cerebrocortical cell cultures, long-term treatment with aminoglutethimide (10-1000 microM) attenuated NMDA receptor-mediated glutamate cytotoxicity but produced no significant effect on glutamate-induced increases in intracellular Ca2+. Brief as well as long-term pretreatment with aminoglutethimide (30-1000 microM) prevented NMDA receptor-dependent ischemic neuronal injury in organotypic cerebrocortical slice cultures, which was associated with suppression of glutamate release during the ischemic insult. These results indicate that aminoglutethimide, irrelevant to its actions on neurosteroid synthesis, protects CNS neurons from excitotoxic and ischemic injuries. Development of aminoglutethimide analogs possessing neuroprotective properties may be of therapeutic value.",

The MOSC domain is predicted to be a sulfur-carrier domain that receives sulfur abstracted by the pyridoxal phosphate-dependent NifS-like enzymes, on its conserved cysteine, and delivers it for the formation of diverse sulfur-metal clusters.

We first investigated mepyramine binding to eight forms of rat hepatic P450s. Mepyramine bound specifically to P450 2D1, which suggests that it inhibits P450 2D activity. Histamine H1 receptor antagonists (mepyramine, diphenhydramine, chlorpheniramine and triprolidine) inhibited the lidocaine 3-hydroxylation activity catalyzed by P450 2D1 but did not inhibit the testosterone hydroxylation activities catalyzed by P450s other than P450 2D forms. The Ki values of these antagonists for the catalytic activity of P450 2D1 were low and were similar to those of quinine and quinidine, which are specific inhibitors of P450 2D forms. The Ki value of mepyramine was especially low, at 34 nM. Furthermore, the effects of mepyramine on human P450 2D6 were investigated. Among the ten forms of human P450 expressed in yeast, mepyramine bound specifically to P450 2D6 in a binding assay. In human hepatic microsomes, mepyramine inhibited the debrisoquine 4-hydroxylation activity catalyzed by P450 2D6. These results indicate that histamine H1 receptor antagonists such as mepyramine are potent inhibitors of P450 2D forms because of their high affinity for these enzymes.",

Our in vitro and in vivo results have shown that verapamil and amlodipine are strong inhibitors of carbonic anhydrase I both in erythrocytes (in human beings) and in vascular smooth muscles (in animals). In human beings calcium channel blockers reduce arterial blood pressure in subjects with hypertension and progressively reduce erythrocyte carbonic anhydrase I activity. We assume that verapamil and amlodipine possess a dual mechanism of action: the first mechanism consists of their action on calcium channels, and the second mechanism, proposed by us, shows that verapamil and amlodipine inhibit vascular smooth muscle carbonic anhydrase I activity with consecutive pH increase. The increase of pH might be an additional factor involved in intracellular calcium influx through calcium channels. This dual mechanism of action would bring new data regarding the hypotensive effect of verapamil and amlodipine, effects that might also be parallel and dependent on carbonic anhydrase I inhibition.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To test binding affinities for, and inhibitory effects on, myometrium of some oxytocin and vasopressin antagonists with respect to their therapeutic potential. DESIGN: Receptor binding studies on transfected cell lines. In vitro contractility studies of human myometrium. SETTING: The Research Laboratory of Sanofi Recherche, Centre de Toulouse, France and the Departments of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Lund University Hospital, Sweden and Bialystok University Hospital, Poland. PARTICIPANTS: Nine women delivered by caesarean section preterm and 37 delivered at term for routine obstetric indications. INTERVENTIONS: The binding affinities of oxytocin, arginine vasopressin, atosiban (1-deamino-2-D-Tyr(OEt)-4-Thr-8-Om-oxytocin), SR 49059 and SR 121463 for the human oxytocin and different subtypes of vasopressin receptors were determined. Concentration-response curves with oxytocin and arginine vasopressin were recorded on myometrium from preterm- and term-delivered women in control experiments and in the presence of 2.5 and 10 nmol/L of SR 49059. Furthermore, using term myometrium, the influence of SR 49059 and SR 121463 in concentrations of 3, 10, 30 and 100 nmol/L on responses to the EC50 concentrations of oxytocin and vasopressin were compared. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Receptor binding affinities. In vitro contractile effects and their inhibitions. RESULTS: Oxytocin had a high affinity for the oxytocin receptor (K(i) in mean = 6.8 nmol/L) and bound, to some extent, to the vasopressin V1a receptor (K(i) = 34.9 nmol/L). Vasopressin displayed higher affinities for vasopressin V1a, V1b and V2 receptors (K(i) = 1.4, 0.8 and 4.2 nmol/L, respectively) than for the oxytocin receptor (K(i) = 48 nmol/L). Atosiban and SR 49059 both had a high affinity for the vasopressin V1a receptor (K(i) = 4.7 and 7.2 nmol/L, respectively, and a moderate one for the oxytocin receptor (K(i) = 397 and 340 nmol/L, respectively). SR 121463 exerted a predominant binding to the V2 receptor (K(i) = 3.0 nmol/L). In the concentration-response experiments levels of up to 10 nmol/L of SR 49059 had no influence on the effect of oxytocin on myometrium from women preterm and at term pregnancy. However, a concentration-dependent inhibition of the responses of both these type of tissues to vasopressin was seen. The effects of EC50 concentrations of oxytocin and vasopressin on term pregnant myometrium were markedly inhibited by 10 nmol/L and higher concentrations of SR 49059, the inhibition of the response to vasopressin being more pronounced than that of the oxytocin response. SR 121463 at maximal concentration only caused slight inhibitions of the oxytocin and vasopressin responses. CONCLUSIONS: Atosiban and SR 49059 both have moderate binding affinities for the human oxytocin receptor and high binding affinities for the vasopressin V1a one. We demonstrated that SR 49059 inhibits the response of term myometrium to oxytocin and that of both preterm and term myometrium to vasopressin. These observations suggest a therapeutic potential of SR 49059 in preterm labour. The vasopressin V2 receptor is apparently not involved to any significant degree in the activation of the pregnant human uterus.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Ischemic postconditioning protects the reperfused heart from infarction, and this protection is dependent on the occupancy of adenosine receptors. We further explored the role of adenosine receptors in this salvage. METHODS: In situ rabbit hearts underwent 30 min of regional ischemia and 3 h of reperfusion, and postconditioning was effected with four cycles of 30-s reperfusion/30-s coronary artery occlusion at the end of ischemia. RESULTS: Postconditioning reduced infarct size from 40.2+/-3.4% of the risk zone in untreated hearts to 15.5+/-2.5%. Protection by postconditioning was blocked by either the non-selective adenosine receptor blocker 8-p-(sulfophenyl)theophylline or the A2b-selective antagonist MRS 1754, injected intravenously 5 min before reperfusion. The protein kinase C (PKC) antagonist chelerythrine also aborted postconditioning's salvage, indicating a PKC-dependent mechanism. Neither the A1-selective antagonist 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine nor the A2a-selective antagonist 8-(13-chlorostyryl)caffeine had an effect on protection. The non-selective but A2b-potent adenosine agonist 5'-(N-ethylcarboxamido)adenosine (NECA) infused from 5 min before to 1h after reperfusion mimicked postconditioning's effect on infarct size (17.2+/-2.7% infarction) and MRS 1754 blocked the NECA-induced cardioprotection, confirming that A2b activation was protective. The PKC activator phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate delivered just before reperfusion also duplicated the protective effect of postconditioning (16.3+/-4.1% infarction), and co-administration of the PKC antagonist chelerythrine aborted PMA's protection, confirming that the protection was the result of PKC activation. NECA's protective effect was not affected by chelerythrine, but rather MRS 1754 blocked PMA's salutary effect (42.8+/-1.0% infarction), suggesting that the A2b receptor's effect is under control of PKC. Finally, wortmannin, a blocker of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, also abrogated protection by PMA. CONCLUSIONS: Salvage of ischemic myocardium by postconditioning is dependent on activation of A2b receptors, which in turn depends on activation of PKC. It is still unclear why PKC activation is required to make the heart's adenosine become protective.",

        "abstract": "Calcium channel blockers are a group of drugs used for the treatment of hypertension. Carbonic anhydrase (CA) I detected in vascular smooth muscle and in other cells in the organism has a major role in the acid-base balance and in vascular processes. Our previous work has proven that verapamil inhibits CA activity by a direct mechanism of action. Starting from our results in this article we studied in vitro and in vivo the effect of calcium channel blockers (verapamil and amlodipine) on erythrocyte CA I, on vascular smooth muscles CA I, and on arterial blood pressure values in human and in animals. Our in vitro and in vivo results have proved that verapamil and amlodipine are strong CA I inhibitors both in human erythrocytes and also in vascular smooth muscles in animals. In humans, calcium channel blockers studied here progressively reduce arterial blood pressure in hypertensive subjects, in parallel with progressive lowering of erythrocyte CA I activity in the normal range in normotensive subjects. From our point of view verapamil and amlodipine possess a dual mechanism of action: the first well-known action consists of their action on calcium channels. The second mechanism, suggested by us, directly acts on the vascular smooth muscle CA I isozyme, so that its inhibition should ensure an adequate pH for calcium ions transport through the channels, having as result vasodilation. This double mechanism could explain the hypotensive effect of verapamil and amlodipine, with a mechanism that partially dependent on CA I inhibition.",

        "title": "Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate: a nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor for the treatment of HIV infection.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (DF) is the first nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor approved for use in combination with other antiretroviral agents in the treatment of HIV-1 infection in the United States. Unlike the nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, which must undergo 3 intracellular phosphorylation steps for activation. nucleotide analogues such as tenofovir require only 2 such steps. This reduction in the phosphorylation requirement has the potential to produce more rapid and complete conversion of the drug to its pharmacologically active metabolite. OBJECTIVE: This article describes the pharmacologic properties and potential clinical usefulness of tenofovir DF. METHODS: Relevant information was identified through searches of MEDLINE (1996-April 2002), Iowa Drug Information Service (1996-April 2002), and International Pharmaceutical Abstracts (1970-April 2002), as well as from meeting abstracts of major HIV/AIDS conferences (1996-2002), using the search terms tenofovir tenofovir disoproxil fumarate, PMPA, bis(POC)PMPA, GS-4331-05, acyclic nucleoside phosphonate, and nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor. Additional information was obtained from material submitted to the US Food and Drug Administration by the manufacturer of tenofovir DF in support of its New Drug Application. RESULTS: In vitro, tenofovir DF has exhibited anti-HIV activity in various HIV-infected cell lines and has produced a synergistic or additive effect against HIV when combined with other antiretroviral agents. In adult humans, tenofovir has a volume of distribution of 0.813 L/kg, is minimally bound to plasma protein (7.2%), has a plasma elimination half-life of 12.0 to 14.4 hours, and is mainly excreted unchanged in urine (70%-80%). Dose adjustment based on sex or body weight does not appear to be necessary, although dose reduction may be necessary in the elderly; there are currently no data on tenofovir DF in renal or hepatic insufficiency. The results of clinical trials suggest the efficacy of tenofovir DF in reducing plasma levels of HIV-1 RNA when used as an add-on to a stable antiretroviral regimen. The most commonly (&gt;3%) reported adverse events in clinical trials have included nausea, diarrhea, asthenia, headache, vomiting, flatulence, abdominal pain, and anorexia. The most commonly (&gt;2%) reported laboratory abnormalities (grade III or IV) included increases in creatine kinase, triglycerides, amylase, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase, as well as hyperglycemia and glucosuria. Serious adverse events leading to discontinuation of tenofovir DF were infrequent (5%), occurring with an incidence similar to that with placebo (8%). The recommended dosage of tenofovir DF in adults is 300 mg/d PO; pharmacokinetic and efficacy studies in children are ongoing. CONCLUSION: Although additional studies are needed, tenofovir DF appears to be a promising agent for the treatment of HIV infection.",

        "abstract": "Human UMP/CMP kinase (cytidylate kinase; EC 2.7.4.14) is responsible for phosphorylation of CMP, UMP, and deoxycytidine monophosphate (dCMP) and also plays an important role in the activation of pyrimidine analogs, some of which are clinically useful anticancer or antiviral drugs. Previous kinetic data using recombinant or highly purified human UMP/CMP kinase showed that dCMP, as well as pyrimidine analog monophosphates, were much poorer substrates than CMP or UMP for this enzyme. This implies that other unidentified mechanisms must be involved to make phosphorylation of dCMP or pyrimidine analog monophosphates inside cells by this enzyme possible. Here, we reevaluated the optimal reaction conditions for human recombinant human UMP/CMP kinase to phosphorylate dCMP and CMP (referred as dCMPK and CMPK activities). We found that ATP and magnesium were important regulators of the kinase activities of this enzyme. Free magnesium enhanced dCMPK activity but inhibited CMPK activity. Free ATP or excess ATP/magnesium, on the other hand, inhibited dCMPK but not CMPK reactions. The differential regulation of dCMPK versus CMPK activities by ATP or magnesium was also seen in other 2'-deoxypyrimidine analog monophosphates (deoxyuridine monophosphate, 5-fluorodeoxyuridine monophosphate, 1-beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine monophosphate, and gemcitabine monophosphate) versus their ribose-counterparts (UMP and 5-fluorouridine monophosphate), in a similar manner. The data suggest that the active sites of human UMP/CMP kinase for dCMP and for CMP cannot be identical. Furthermore, enzyme inhibition studies demonstrated that CMP could inhibit dCMP phosphorylation in a noncompetitive manner, with Ki values much higher than its own Km values. We thus propose novel models for the phosphorylation action of human UMP/CMP kinase.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The active metabolite of the anti-inflammatory drug nabumetone has been characterized as a selective inhibitor of the inducible prostaglandin H synthase (PGHS). The aim of this study was to investigate the rate of eicosanoid biosynthesis after oral dosing with nabumetone in nine healthy subjects. METHODS: We measured the urinary excretion of products of platelet (11-dehydro-thromboxane B2 [TXB2]) and renal (prostaglandin IF2 alpha [PGF2 alpha]) arachidonate metabolism as in vivo indexes of the constitutive PGHS-1 pathway. Moreover, the production of TXB2 during whole blood clotting was assessed as an index of the cyclooxygenase activity of platelet PGHS-1 ex vivo. RESULTS: At steady state, nabumetone (500 and 1000 mg daily for 7 days) was associated with statistically significant dose-dependent reduction in the urinary excretion of 11-dehydro-TXB2 and serum TXB2 levels by approximately 50% to 70%. However, the drug did not significantly affect the urinary excretion of PGF2 alpha. After discontinuation of nabumetone, urinary 11-dehydro-TXB2 excretion and whole blood TXB2 production returned to predrug levels with a similar timecourse that was consistent with the elimination half-life of its active metabolite. The daily administration of low-dose aspirin (40 mg), a selective inhibitor of platelet PGHS-1, caused a cumulative inhibition of urinary 11-dehydro-TXB2 and whole blood TXB2 production that recovered with a timecourse consistent with platelet turnover. CONCLUSIONS: Nabumetone does dose-dependently inhibit the cyclooxygenase activity of platelet PGHS-1 of healthy subjects both in vivo and ex vivo. Thus it is unlikely that its safety profile in patients may be related to selective inhibition of the inducible PGHS-2.",

High concentrations of antagonists of histamine H2 receptors, muscarinic receptors, alpha 1-adrenoceptors and serotonin receptors did not inhibit the effect. The histamine H1-receptor antagonists mepyramine, triprolidine, promethazine, d-chlorpheniramine and the tricyclic antidepressant doxepin inhibited the response with Ki values corresponding to an interaction with histamine H1-receptors. The EC50 for the response was about three times lower than the Ki value (approximately 300 microM) for the inhibition by histamine of [3H]mepyramine binding to membranes from rat brain cortex. Partial inactivation of H1-receptors with the alkylating antagonist phenoxybenzamine resulted in similar reductions in [3H]mepyramine binding sites and in the maximal histamine-induced [3H]inositol 1-phosphate accumulation, without affecting the KD for the radioligand or the EC50 for the response. The apparent dissociation constant for histamine calculated from these experiments (KA = 92.2 microM) was not different from the EC50 value. The present results indicate that histamine-stimulated phosphoinositide hydrolysis in rat brain cortex is mediated by H1-receptors and that no receptor reserve is present.",

        "title": "The effects of methylphenidate on knockin mice with a methylphenidate-resistant dopamine transporter.",
        "abstract": "Methylphenidate (Ritalin) is one of the most commonly abused prescription drugs. It is a psychostimulant that inhibits the dopamine and norepinephrine transporters with high affinity. In mice, methylphenidate stimulates locomotor activity, is self-administered, and produces conditioned place preference, typical properties of an addictive drug. We have generated a knockin mouse line bearing a mutant dopamine transporter that is approximately 80-fold less sensitive to cocaine inhibition than wild type. It is interesting to note that this mutant is also almost 50-fold less sensitive to methylphenidate inhibition, suggesting similarities in the binding site for cocaine and methylphenidate. Because methylphenidate is not effective at inhibiting the mutant dopamine transporter, we hypothesized that it would not stimulate locomotor activity or produce reward in the knockin mice. In these knockin mice, doses up to 40 mg/kg methylphenidate either inhibit or fail to stimulate locomotor activity and do not produce conditioned place preference. Doses up to 40 mg/kg methylphenidate also fail to produce stereotypy in the knockin mice. Nisoxetine and desipramine, selective norepinephrine transporter inhibitors, also reduce locomotor activity in wild-type and knockin mice. These results indicate that enhanced dopaminergic neurotransmission is required for methylphenidate's stimulating and rewarding effects. In addition, we observed that drugs enhancing noradrenergic neurotransmission inhibit locomotor activity in mice, which is consistent with the notion that methylphenidate's ability to inhibit the norepinephrine transporter may contribute to its efficacy in treating attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.",

        "abstract": "The alpha(2C)-adrenergic receptor (alpha(2C)AR) is known to be poorly trafficked to the cell surface when expressed in a variety of cell types. We tested the hypothesis that the surface expression and signaling of alpha(2C)AR might be enhanced by heterodimerization with other G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Cotransfection of alpha(2C)AR with more than 25 related GPCRs revealed that only coexpression with the beta(2)-adrenergic receptor (beta(2)AR) increased the surface localization of alpha(2C)AR in human embryonic kidney-293 cells. Coimmunoprecipitation of alpha(2C)AR with beta(2)AR confirmed a physical interaction between the two receptors. Confocal microscopy studies demonstrated that alpha(2C)AR expressed alone was mainly intracellular, whereas alpha(2C)AR coexpressed with beta(2)AR was predominantly localized to the plasma membrane. Ligand binding studies revealed a significant increase in alpha(2C)AR binding sites upon coexpression with beta(2)AR, with no apparent change in affinity for alpha(2)AR ligands. Functional assays with the alpha(2)AR-specific agonist brimonidine (UK 14,304) revealed that coexpression of beta(2)AR with alpha(2C)AR enhanced alpha(2C)AR-mediated activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2. Furthermore, analyses of agonist-promoted receptor endocytosis demonstrated enhanced alpha(2C)AR internalization in response to alpha(2)AR agonists when alpha(2C)AR and beta(2)AR were coexpressed. In addition, substantial cointernalization of alpha(2C)AR in response to betaAR agonists was observed when alpha(2C)AR was coexpressed with beta(2)AR. These data reveal that alpha(2C)AR can interact with beta(2)AR in cells in a manner that regulates alpha(2C)AR surface expression, internalization, and functionality.",

        "abstract": "The pharmacodynamic profile of the new angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor moexipril and its active diacid, moexiprilat, was studied in vitro and in vivo. In vitro, moexiprilat exhibited a higher inhibitory potency than enalaprilat against both plasma ACE and purified ACE from rabbit lung. Upon oral administration of moexipril (10 mg/kg/day) to spontaneously hypertensive rats, plasma angiotensin II concentration decreased to undetectable levels, plasma ACE activity was inhibited by 98% and plasma angiotensin I concentration increased 8.6-fold 1 h after dosing. At 24 h, plasma angiotensin I and angiotensin II concentrations had returned to pretreatment levels, whereas plasma ACE activity was still inhibited by 56%. Four-week oral administration of moexipril (0.1-30 mg/kg/day) to spontaneously hypertensive rats lowered blood pressure and differentially inhibited ACE activity in plasma, lung, aorta, heart and kidney in a dose-dependent fashion. Equidose treatment (10 mg/kg/day) with moexipril and enalapril over 4 weeks led to comparable decreases in blood pressure, inhibition of plasma ACE and reduction of plasma angiotensinogen and to a similar attenuation of the pressor responses to angiotensin I and potentiation of the depressor responses to bradykinin. In contrast, ACE inhibition in aorta, heart and lung was significantly greater with moexipril than with enalapril, whereas in the kidney both drugs inhibited ACE activity to a similar extent. In summary, moexipril is an orally active ACE inhibitor that is comparable to enalapril in potency and duration of antihypertensive activity. The results of the present study demonstrate that 1) the antihypertensive potency of a given ACE inhibitor cannot be predicted from its in vitro characteristics and 2) the degree of blood pressure reduction does not correlate with tissue ACE inhibition.",

        "abstract": "The chemistry, pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, clinical efficacy, adverse effects, and dosages of the nonsedating histamine H1-receptor antagonists terfenadine, astemizole, loratadine, and acrivastine are reviewed. Terfenadine and astemizole are chemically unrelated to histamine H1-receptor antagonists such as diphenhydramine and chlorpheniramine. Loratadine is structurally related to the antihistamine azatadine, and acrivastine is a side-chain-reduced metabolite of the antihistamine triprolidine. Like other histamine H1-receptor antagonists, they competitively block histamine receptor sites rather than inhibiting histamine release. All four drugs have relatively long half-lives and are rapidly absorbed after oral administration. Terfenadine, astemizole, and loratadine are metabolized extensively in the liver; terfenadine and astemizole are both 97% protein bound. Terfenadine 60 mg twice daily has been shown to be as effective as conventional antihistamines for the treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis. In clinical trials, astemizole 10 mg daily was comparable to or better than chlorpheniramine for treatment of chronic rhinitis. Both terfenadine and astemizole were effective for treatment of chronic urticaria. For treatment of seasonal allergic rhinitis, loratadine combined with pseudoephedrine may be preferable to triprolidine-pseudoephedrine and acrivastine-pseudoephedrine combinations that require more frequent dosing. Acrivastine must be administered more frequently than the other nonsedating antihistamines. None of these four agents impairs psychomotor activity. Infrequently reported adverse effects include dry mouth, skin reactions, and weight gain. The absence of substantial sedative effects and the less-frequent dosing schedules make these agents good alternatives to the classic antihistamines for treatment of seasonal and chronic rhinitis and chronic urticaria.",

In this study, we assessed the antinociceptive effects of the atypical neuroleptic drug amisulpride, which acts as a selective blocker of dopamine D2 and D3 receptors. Furthermore, at low doses amisulpride has a selective preference for presynaptic dopamine autoreceptors, while at high doses it manifests a preferential action at post-synaptic dopamine receptors. We found amisulpride to be a potent antinociceptor agent in the mouse tail-flick assay, with an ED50 of 36.6 mg/kg. This effect was antagonized by naloxone (P&lt;0.05), indicating an involvement of opioid mechanisms as mediators of the antinociceptive effect of amisulpride. Beta-funaltrexamine (mu1- and mu2-opioid receptor antagonist), naloxonazine (selective mu1-opioid receptor antagonist), naltrindole (selective delta-opioid receptor antagonist), Nor-binaltorphamine (kappa1-opioid receptor antagonist) reversed amisulpride antinociception at the same dose that they antagonized morphine's antinociceptive effect (all P&lt;0.005). We found that the sensitivity of amisulpride-induced antinociception is mediated through selective involvement of all three opioid receptor subtypes. Based on previous studies with risperidone, clozapine and olanzapine we tend to attribute this global interaction with the opioid system to amisulpride's action at the dopamine D2 receptor sites.",

Treatment of the human breast cancer cell lines MDA-MB-453, ZR-75-1 and T47-D with high dose (100 nM) MPA resulted in 26-30% inhibition of cell growth, which was partially reversed by co-treatment with a 10-fold excess of the synthetic antiandrogen, anandron. Scatchard analysis demonstrated specific, high affinity (non-PR) binding of [3H]MPA to cytosols prepared from the PR-/AR+ MDA-MB-453 and PR+/AR+ ZR-75-1, but not the PR-/AR- BT-20 breast cancer cell lines. Competition of [3H]MPA binding to MDA-MB-453 cytosols by equimolar concentrations of androgens (5alpha-dihydrotestosterone (DHT), R1881) and the antiandrogen, anandron was consistent with binding of MPA to the AR. In ZR-75-1 cell cytosol fractions, DHT, R1881 and anandron only partially competed out [3H]MPA binding, suggesting that androgens displace [3H]MPA binding to AR but not to PR. Induction by MPA of AR transactivation was demonstrated in MDA-MB-453 and ZR-75-1 cells, and in the CV-1 cell line transfected with a full-length AR. In these cell lines the increased activity of the androgen responsive reporter gene (MMTV-CAT) by 1 nM MPA was fully (MDA-MB-453, CV-1) or partially (ZR-75-1) inhibited by co-culture with 1 microM anandron. These findings indicate that MPA is an AR agonist and suggest that the in vivo effects of MPA in breast cancer patients may in part be mediated by the AR.",

        "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Entacapone is a potent and specific peripheral catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) inhibitor. It has been shown to improve the clinical benefits of levodopa plus an aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase inhibitor (AADC) when given to patients with Parkinson's disease and end-of-dose deterioration in the response to levodopa (the 'wearing off' phenomenon). The efficacy of entacapone is currently being assessed in patients with stable Parkinson's disease. In 2 well conducted trials of 6 months' duration and smaller short term studies, treatment with entacapone (200 mg with each dose of levodopa/AADC inhibitor) was associated with significant increases in daily 'on' time and decreases in 'off' time. Changes in Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) scores concurred with changes in 'on' and 'off' times: entacapone improved total, activities of daily living and motor function scores, but it had no effect on mentation scores. Entacapone also provided benefits when given with controlled release levodopa/ AADC inhibitor or with standard levodopa/AADC inhibitor and selegiline in small trials. Dopaminergic events, including dyskinesia and nausea, are among the most common events with entacapone, and are related to the drug's ability to potentiate the effects of levodopa. Diarrhoea, abdominal pain, constipation and urine discolouration are the most common nondopaminergic events, although the latter event is the only one to occur consistently more frequently with entacapone than with placebo. However, adverse events of any type infrequently led to study discontinuation. CONCLUSIONS: The efficacy and tolerability of entacapone administered with levodopa/AADC inhibitor have not yet been compared with those of other strategies for the treatment of Parkinson's disease. However, once the decision to initiate levodopa therapy has been made, studies generally support the use of entacapone as an adjunct to levodopa in patients with Parkinson's disease and the 'wearing off' phenomenon.",

        "abstract": "A new approach in the treatment of Parkinson's disease is the inhibition of catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) with new generation COMT inhibitors, entacapone and tolcapone. Entacapone acts mainly peripherally whereas tolcapone acts both peripherally and centrally. They induce a dose-dependent inhibition of COMT activity in erythrocytes and a significant decrease in the plasma levels of 3-O-methyldopa, indicating their effectiveness as COMT inhibitors. Consequently, they increase the elimination half-life of levodopa and thus prolong the availability of levodopa to the brain without significantly affecting the Cmax or tmax of levodopa. Clinically, the improved levodopa availability is seen as prolonged motor response to levodopa/DDC inhibitor and also as prolonged duration of dyskinesias in Parkinson's disease patients with end-of-dose fluctuations. The dyskinesias are managed by decreasing the daily levodopa dose in Parkinson's disease patients with end-of-dose fluctuations. Both pharmacokinetically and clinically the 200-mg dose of entacapone is the most effective dose compared with placebo. For tolcapone 100 and 200 mg have most often proved to be the optimal doses. Based on the duration of COMT inhibition entacapone is administered with each levodopa/DDC inhibitor dose whereas tolcapone is given three times daily. Both entacapone and tolcapone are well-tolerated. However, there seems to be a trend for tolcapone to induce more often diarrhoea and increase in liver transaminases compared with entacapone. Thus, COMT inhibitors are clinically significant and beneficial adjunct to levodopa therapy in Parkinson's disease patients with end-of-dose fluctuations. Their effects and significance also in the treatment of de novo patients need to be clarified.",

        "abstract": "Dopamine partial agonism and functional selectivity have been innovative strategies in the pharmacological treatment of schizophrenia and mood disorders and have shifted the concept of dopamine modulation beyond the established approach of dopamine D2 receptor (D2R) antagonism. Despite the fact that aripiprazole was introduced in therapy more than 12 years ago, many questions are still unresolved regarding the complexity of the effects of this agent on signal transduction and intracellular pathways, in part linked to its pleiotropic receptor profile. The complexity of the mechanism of action has progressively shifted the conceptualization of this agent from partial agonism to functional selectivity. From the induction of early genes to modulation of scaffolding proteins and activation of transcription factors, aripiprazole has been shown to affect multiple cellular pathways and several cortical and subcortical neurotransmitter circuitries. Growing evidence shows that, beyond the consequences of D2R occupancy, aripiprazole has a unique neurobiology among available antipsychotics. The effect of chronic administration of aripiprazole on D2R affinity state and number has been especially highlighted, with relevant translational implications for long-term treatment of psychosis. The hypothesized effects of aripiprazole on cell-protective mechanisms and neurite growth, as well as the differential effects on intracellular pathways [i.e. extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK)] compared with full D2R antagonists, suggest further exploration of these targets by novel and future biased ligand compounds. This review aims to recapitulate the main neurobiological effects of aripiprazole and discuss the potential implications for upcoming improvements in schizophrenia therapy based on dopamine modulation beyond D2R antagonism.",

        "abstract": "Cefdinir, a new oral 2-amino-5-thiazolyl cephalosporin, inhibited the luminol-amplified chemiluminescence (LACL) response of human neutrophils stimulated by PMA but not opsonized zymosan, in a concentration-dependent but not time-dependent manner. The LACL response to opsonized zymosan in cytochalasin B-treated neutrophils was, however, inhibited by cefdinir. Various cephalosporins, regardless of the presence of a 2-amino-5-thiazolyl moiety, did not significantly alter the neutrophil LACL response triggered by PMA and zymosan. The LACL response induced by the calcium ionophore A23187 and FMLP was also impaired by cefdinir, and this impairment was increased in cytochalasin B-treated neutrophils. Superoxide anion generation by neutrophils, measured in terms of lucigenin-amplified chemiluminescence and cytochrome c reduction, was not altered. Spontaneous and FMLP-induced neutrophil degranulation, assessed by lysozyme and beta-glucuronidase release, were not modified by cefdinir. Furthermore, cefdinir inhibited LACL generation in cell-free systems consisting of H2O2, NaI, and either horseradish peroxidase or a myeloperoxidase-containing neutrophil extract. Orthodianisidine oxidation in these two acellular systems was inhibited by cefdinir. Cefdinir did not alter neutrophil bacterial killing at concentrations that inhibited myeloperoxidase-containing neutrophil extract-dependent reactions induced by soluble stimuli. Taken together, these data strongly suggest that cefdinir directly inhibits the activity of myeloperoxidase-containing neutrophil extract released into the extracellular medium during neutrophil stimulation by soluble mediators, but has no effect on that released into the phagolysosome during phagocytosis. This unusual property of a member of the beta-lactam family could be of interest in modulating the exaggerated inflammatory process often associated with infectious diseases.",

Calculated inhibition constants (Ki) for the antidepressants were in the range of 2.6 x 10(-11) to 2.3 x 10(-7) M and correlated very well with their equilibrium dissociation constants derived from biological assays of the H1-receptor. Increasing the concentration of receptors present in the binding assay resulted in an overestimation of the calculated Ki's for doxepin, amitriptyline, and nortriptyline, but not for the lower affinity compounds of the series, imipramine, protriptyline, and desipramine.

        "abstract": "This study investigated the action of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) mimetics on short-term memory function. The objective was to determine whether two closely related tasks could differentiate between partial 5-HT(1A) receptor activation, full 5-HT(1A) receptor activation and generalised enhanced serotonin (5-HT) activity. Male hooded Lister rats were trained to perform an operant-based combined delayed matching/non-matching to position task. Drugs used were: fluoxetine (3 mg/kg, i.p.), a selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitor; the full 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist, 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-OH-DPAT; 0.3 mg/kg, s.c.); and the partial 5-HT(1A) receptor agonist, buspirone (1 mg/kg, i.p.). Buspirone differentially disrupted response accuracy depending on the style of trial. There was no such difference in the case of 8-OH-DPAT, which impaired accuracy in both delayed matching/non-matching to position task, while fluoxetine affected neither. Thus, the findings suggest that partial 5-HT(1A) receptor activation compromises cognitive function to a greater extent than full 5-HT(1A) receptor activation, although a dopaminergic component cannot be excluded since buspirone possesses some dopamine D2 receptor antagonist activity. Furthermore, it suggests that there is a differential role for 5-HT in these two closely related behavioural tasks.",

Twenty-five different antidepressants were studied at all but the D-2 receptor at which the number was 13 (including a metabolite of an antidepressant).

At the human brain histamine H1 receptor, antidepressants remained among the most potent histamine H1 antagonists known, although their affinities for human receptors were lower than those for animal receptors. The most potent and the least potent compounds at the receptors were doxepin (KD = 0.24 nM) and fluvoxamine (KD = 109 microM) at the histamine H1 receptor, amitriptyline (KD = 18 nM) and trazodone (KD = 324 microM) at the muscarinic receptor, doxepin (KD = 24 nM) and viloxazine (KD = 14 microM) at the alpha-1 receptor, mianserin (KD = 73 nM) and bupropion (KD = 81 microM) at the alpha-2 receptor and amoxapine (KD = 160 nM) and trazodone (KD = 3800 nM) at the D-2 receptor, respectively.

Selective inhibition of PTGR2 may contribute to the improvement of insulin sensitivity with fewer side effects. PTGR2 belongs to the medium-chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily. The crystal structures reported here reveal features of the NADPH binding-induced conformational change in a LID motif and a polyproline type II helix which are critical for the reaction. Mutation of Tyr64 and Tyr259 significantly reduces the rate of catalysis but increases the affinity to substrate, confirming the structural observations. Besides targeting cyclooxygenase, indomethacin also inhibits PTGR2 with a binding mode similar to that of 15-keto-PGE(2).

        "abstract": "Prourokinase-induced plasminogen activation is complex and involves three distinct reactions: (1) plasminogen activation by the intrinsic activity of prourokinase; (2) prourokinase activation by plasmin; (3) plasminogen activation by urokinase. To further understand some of the mechanisms involved, the effects of epsilon-aminocaproic acid (EACA), a lysine analogue, on these reactions were studied. At a low range of concentrations (10-50 microM), EACA significantly inhibited prourokinase-induced (Glu-/Lys-) plasminogen activation, prourokinase activation by Lys-plasmin, and (Glu-/Lys-) plasminogen activation by urokinase. However, no inhibition of plasminogen activation by Ala158-prourokinase (a plasmin-resistant mutant) occurred. Therefore, the overall inhibition of EACA on prourokinase-induced plasminogen activation was mainly due to inhibition of reactions 2 and 3, by blocking the high-affinity lysine binding interaction between plasmin and prourokinase, as well as between plasminogen and urokinase. These findings were consistent with kinetic studies which suggested that binding of kringle 1-4 of plasmin to the N-terminal region of prourokinase significantly promotes prourokinase activation, and that binding of kringle 1-4 of plasminogen to the C-terminal lysine158 of urokinase significantly promotes plasminogen activation. In conclusion, EACA was found to inhibit, rather than promote, prourokinase-induced plasminogen activation due to its blocking of the high-affinity lysine binding sites on plasmin(ogen).",

While this overall process causes an inhibition of fibrinolysis, the converse was observed with a 26-residue synthetic peptide (AP26) corresponding to the carboxy-terminal region of alpha(2)AP. The AP26 peptide, in fact, accelerated urokinase-induced lysis of (1) fully crosslinked fibrin with complete gamma-dimer and alpha-polymer formation; (2) partially crosslinked fibrin that had undergone only gamma-dimerization; and (3) noncrosslinked fibrin. The AP26 peptide also inhibited factor XIIIa-catalyzed crosslinking of fibrin alpha-chains, and this also accelerated lysis of fibrin. EACA had no effect. In the presence of noncrosslinked fibrin, AP26 promoted plasminogen activation by urokinase and fibrinolysis. EACA only slightly increased the rate of plasminogen activation, and as expected, it inhibited fibrinolysis. Since AP26 peptide enhanced the lysis of partially crosslinked and noncrosslinked fibrin, our results indicate that inhibition of factor XIIIa-catalyzed alpha-polymer formation by AP26, although associated with accelerated fibrinolysis, is not the primary mechanism. Instead, our data support the conclusion that AP26 enhances the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin approximately 5-fold, probably by inducing a conformational change in plasminogen structure just as occurs with low concentrations of lysine or EACA. At higher concentrations, however, AP26 apparently does not approach the avidity or affinity of lysine or EACA for the kringle structures of plasminogen or plasmin so that their binding to fibrin is blocked. Whether AP26 alone, or as part of another molecule, could have potential for enhancing thrombolysis will require further study.",

The hypothesis was that the dopamine D2 receptor antagonist activity of buspirone would attenuate the rate-decreasing effects of nicotine. When administered alone, buspirone (0.3-10mg/kg) and (-)-nicotine (0.1-3.0mg/kg) decreased response rates in a dose-related manner, with ED(50) values (+/-95% C.L.) of 3.0 (1.7-5.1) mg/kg and 1.0 (0.7-1.5) mg/kg, respectively. Low doses of buspirone (0.3-1.0mg/kg) did not significantly shift the nicotine dose-response function, while doses of buspirone (3.0-10mg/kg) that produced rate-decreasing effects shifted the nicotine dose-response function to the left. There was no significant statistical interaction between buspirone and nicotine indicating that the shifts in the nicotine dose-response function were parallel. The buspirone analog gepirone (0.3-10mg/kg), which like buspirone is a serotonin (5-HT(1A)) agonist, but unlike buspirone is relatively devoid of D2 antagonist activity, was also tested in combination with nicotine. Gepirone was less potent in decreasing response rates compared with buspirone, with an ED(56) value of 4.5 (3.1-6.7) mg/kg. Rate-decreasing doses of gepirone (3.0-10mg/kg) in combination with nicotine resulted in parallel shifts to the left of the nicotine dose-response function. There was no statistically significant difference between the effects of buspirone and those of gepirone on the nicotine dose-response function. Isobolograms indicated that the pharmacological interactions between buspirone or gepirone and nicotine were not different from additivity. These results suggest that the combined effects of buspirone and nicotine on schedule-controlled behavior are independent of antagonism at D2 receptors.",

Previous studies have demonstrated that fluid shear stress (flow) inhibits cytokine-induced JNK activation in endothelial cells (ECs). In the present study, we show JNK activation by ROS in ECs and hypothesized that flow inhibits ROS-induced JNK activation in ECs via modulation of cellular protection systems against ROS. JNK was activated by 300 micro mol/L hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in bovine lung microvascular ECs (BLMVECs) with a peak at 60 minutes after stimulation (6.3+/-1.2-fold increase). Preexposure of BLMVECs to physiological steady laminar flow (shear stress=12 dyne/cm2) for 10 minutes significantly decreased H2O2-induced JNK activation. Thioredoxin and glutathione are cellular antioxidants that protect cells against ROS. Flow induced a significant increase in the ratio of reduced glutathione to oxidized glutathione consistent with a 1.6-fold increase in glutathione reductase (GR) activity. Preincubation of BLMVECs with the GR inhibitor, 1,3 bis-(2 chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea, abolished the inhibitory effect of flow. In contrast, preincubation of BLMVECs with azelaic acid, a specific inhibitor for thioredoxin reductase, did not alter the effect of flow on H2O2-induced JNK activation. Overexpression of GR mimicked the effect of flow to inhibit JNK activation. These results suggest that flow activates GR, an important regulator of the intracellular redox state of glutathione, and exerts a protective mechanism against oxidative stress in endothelial cells.",

        "title": "Impaired activation of the fibrinolytic system in children with Henoch-Schonlein purpura: beneficial effect of hydrocortisone plus Sigma-aminocaproic acid therapy on disappearance rate of cutaneous vasculitis and fibrinolysis.",
        "abstract": "Systemic vasculitis is a predominant clinical symptom in Henoch-Schonlein purpura (HSP), and some studies suggested that decreased blood fibrinolytic activity, as well as blood platelets, is of importance in the development of cutaneous vasculitis. Although patients with HSP have normal blood coagulation, little is known about the fibrinolytic system. On the other hand, it is known that the focus of Sigma-aminocaproic acid (EACA) activity in vivo is probably the blood platelet-vessel wall interaction or a vascular component alone. The aim of this study was, therefore, to investigate blood coagulation and fibrinolytic system as well as the effect of hydrocortisone (H) plus EACA therapy (Group I) on plasma antithrombin-III (AT-III), alpha1-proteinase inhibitor (alpha1-PI), alpha2-antiplasmin (alpha2-A), alpha2-macroglobulin (alpha2-M) activity, fibrinogen and plasminogen concentrations in plasma, euglobulin clot lysis time (ELT), and disappearance rate of cutaneous vasculitis in 14 children with HSP aged 7.6 +/- 3.1 (SD) years. Ten patients (8.6 +/- 2.5 years old) were treated with H alone (Group II), and 8 healthy, age-matched children served as controls. Plasma proteinase inhibitor activity was estimated with the kinetic method using Boehringer chromozyme tests before administration of H (9.2 +/- 3.3 mg/kg/d, i.v.) plus EACA (140 +/- 52 mg/kg/d, p.o.) for 5.93 +/- 2.05 days, and 24 hours after the last dose of EACA, as well as before and after treatment with H alone (8.25 +/- 1.74 mg/kg/24 h, i.v.) for 7.1 +/- 1.2 days. It was found that patients with HSP had the initial fibrinogen and plasminogen plasma concentrations significantly increased compared with the controls (Group I: 3.93 +/- 1.3 g/L and 124 +/- 38%; Group II: 4.24 +/- 0.89 g/L and 134 +/- 42% vs. 2.96 +/- 0.34 g/L, and 90 +/- 14%, respectively). Also, there was a marked decrease of the initial plasma alpha2-A activity in Group II compared with the controls (0.69 +/- 0.29 vs. 0.94 +/- 0.11 IU/mL, respectively, t = 2.33, P &lt;.045). Both treatment regimens significantly improved fibrinolysis, which manifested as a shortening of ELT, but the mean values of this parameter remained within normal range. After treatment with H plus EACA, the skin lesions started to disappear significantly faster compared with the H alone regimen (2.28 +/- 0.45 days vs. 4.12 +/- 1.05, t = 4.41, P &lt;.0023). In four of six patients receiving H plus EACA therapy, an approximately 20% decrease of systolic and diastolic arterial blood pressure lasting for 5 to 7 hours after administration of EACA was observed. These results may suggest that children with HSP have impaired plasma fibrinolytic activity and that an increased release of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) might be, at least in part, responsible for this phenomenon. Concomitant use of H (approximately 10 mg/kg/d) plus EACA (approximately 100 mg/kg/d) for a few days opens new therapeutic possibilities in some children with HSP.",

        "abstract": "Azelaic acid (AZA) has been reported to have an inhibitory effect on DNA synthesis of melanoma cell lines. In order to elucidate the mechanism(s) underlying this inhibitory effect, I elected to study the effects of AZA and, for control purposes, adipic acid (ADA) on DNA synthesis rate of nuclei isolated from melanoma cells and keratinocytes cultured in the presence of different concentrations of the dicarboxylic acids. Before doing so, I found, by autoradiography, that [3H]AZA is incorporated into the nuclei in a time-dependent manner. AZA, and to a lesser extent ADA, caused a dose-dependent inhibition of DNA synthesis, regardless of whether these substances were present in cell cultures before isolation of nuclei, or were incubated with already isolated nuclei. In searching for the target for this inhibitory effect on nuclear DNA synthesis, I found that AZA, and to a lesser extent ADA, is a potent inhibitor of both bacterial DNA polymerase and of multienzyme complexes isolated from cultured melanoma cells and keratinocytes. These data suggest that the inhibitory effect of the dicarboxylic acids AZA and ADA on DNA synthesis of several cell lines is due to the interference of these substances with the activation of enzymes (e.g. DNA polymerases) required for DNA synthesis.",

        "abstract": "Azelaic acid (C9- -dicarboxylic acid) is a competitive inhibitor of tyrosinase and some oxidoreductase in vitro, and in vivo has a beneficial effect on lentigo maligna and malignant melanoma. A definite cytotoxic effect in cultures of malignant melanocytes was also reported. In order to establish if the cytotoxic effect of the diacid is exerted equally in the absence of tyrosinase, lymphoma- and leukemia-derived cell lines were cultured for 72 hr with 10(-3) M, 10(-2) M and 5 X 10(-2) M C9 disodium salt. Normal resting lymphocytes, lymphocytes activated by phytohemoagglutinin, and mouse Balb/c 3T3 fibroblasts were also tested to study a possible effect of azelaic acid on DNA synthesis and cell duplication. At 10(-3) M C9 had no effect on the viability of all the cells tested; at 10(-2) M and 5 X 10(-2) M, C9 2Na had a 50-80% cytotoxic effect on lymphoma- and leukemia-derived cell lines, while at the same concentrations it was not toxic to normal lymphocytes, either resting or stimulated, or to 3T3 fibroblasts. The experiments on cellular incorporation of (1-9 14C) azelaic acid showed that the radiocarbon uptake was two to three times higher for lymphoma- and leukemia-derived cell lines than for lymphocytes, either resting or stimulated, or 3T3 fibroblasts. Biochemical analysis revealed that the diacid underwent beta-oxidation in all the cell cultures. Fractionated centrifugations of 3T3 fibroblasts cultured in the presence of radiolabelled azelaic acid (2 X 10(-4) M) plus cold C9 2Na (10(-2) M), showed that the radioactivity was mainly concentrated in the cytoplasm. The results, being similar to those obtained by adding azelaic acid to cultures of melanoma cells, suggest that the cytotoxic effect of azelaic acid may be due to interference with mitochondrial oxido-reductase enzymes, rather than with tyrosinase. The difference in reaction between lymphoma- and leukemia-derived cell lines and normal or stimulated lymphocytes, and 3T3 fibroblasts, could be explained on the basis of a different degree of permeability of the cell membrane, and/or to a possible different sensitivity of reaction of mitochondrial functions. A similar argument could be used to explain the absence of an effect of dicarboxylic acids upon normal as compared with hyperactive or malignant melanocytes in vivo.",

In vitro, risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone had similar binding profiles, and their highest affinity was for 5-HT2A receptors (cloned human, Ki 0.4 nM); affinities for other 5-HT-receptor subtypes were at least 100 times lower. Risperidone bound to 5-HT2A receptors with 20 times greater affinity than clozapine and 170 times greater affinity than haloperidol. Clozapine primarily bound to histamine H1 receptors and haloperidol to dopamine D2 receptors. The binding affinity of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone for the D2 family of receptors (D2L, D2S, D3, D4) was one order of magnitude lower than their affinity for 5-HT2A receptors. Risperidone bound to D2 and D3 receptors with 50 and 20 times greater affinity than clozapine and was only 2 to 3 times less potent than haloperidol. All compounds bound with similar affinities to D4 receptors (Ki 5-9 nM), and their affinities for D1 receptors were 100 times lower than for D4 receptors. The ex vivo receptor occupancy profile of the compounds matched the in vitro receptor binding profile. A conspicuous property of risperidone, not seen for the other compounds, was the shallow occupancy curve at D2 receptors in the striatum and mesolimbic brain area. Moreover, it was observed that antagonism of strong D2-receptor stimulation by apomorphine in rats was achieved at less than 50% D2 occupancy by the antipsychotics.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

These two neuraminidase inhibitors, oseltamivir and zanamivir, are recommended for the treatment and prophylaxis of influenza A and B in children and adults. Zanamivir, which is the focus of this review, is an inhaled antiviral that has shown benefit in the community, household, and nursing home population for post-exposure prophylaxis. Zanamivir protection rates range from 67%-84% in clinical trials of adults and children.

We analyzed enzyme properties of the D197 and E197 NAs and compared these to a D197N NA, known to arise after oseltamivir treatment. Zanamivir and peramivir bound slowly to the wild type NA, but binding of oseltamivir was more rapid. The D197E/N mutations resulted in faster binding of all three inhibitors. Analysis of the crystal structures of D197 and E197 NAs with and without inhibitors showed that the D197E mutation compromised the interaction of neighboring R150 with the N-acetyl group, common to the substrate sialic acid and all NA inhibitors. Although rotation of the E275 in the NA active site occurs upon binding peramivir in both the D197 and E197 NAs, this does not occur upon binding oseltamivir in the E197 NA. Lack of the E275 rotation would also account for the loss of slow binding and the partial resistance of influenza B wild type NAs to oseltamivir.",

        "abstract": "A role of the potent and long-acting vasoconstrictor peptide endothelin-1 and the pathophysiology of chronic human heart failure has been postulated based upon indirect evidence such as elevated plasma endothelin-1 levels and their with the degree of hemodynamic impairment. The advent of specific of endothelin-1 receptor antagonists has provided the opportunity not only to directly evaluate its pathophysiological role but also to assess its potential role as a new approach to heart failure therapy. This brief review summarizes the evidence linking endothelin-1 to the pathophysiology of chronic heart failure and the clinical results obtained in patients during acute, intravenous and more prolonged, oral administration with bosentan, a mixed ET(A)/ET(B)-receptor antagonist. Bosentan acutely and during short-term oral therapy markedly improved hemodynamics in patients in addition to standard heart failure therapy, including an ACE-inhibitor. These effects were associated with a reduced responsiveness of the renin-angiotensin system to diuretic therapy and reduced basal plasma aldosterone levels. Although the hemodynamic and neurohumoral profile of short-term bosentan therapy looks promising for the treatment of patients with chronic heart failure appropriate trials will have to be performed to document clinical benefit during long-term therapy. Finally, the question remains open whether mixed endothelin-1 receptor antagonists like bosentan will have similar effects as compared to antagonists which block the ET(A) receptor only.",

        "abstract": "The interaction of dopaminergic antagonists with the D(1A) dopamine receptor was assessed in PC2 cells that transiently express this receptor. The maximal binding and dissociation constants for the D(1A) dopamine receptor, using the ligand [(125)I]SCH23982 were 0.38 +/- 0.09 nM and 1 to 4 pmol/mg, respectively, when assessed 48 h after transfection with cDNA encoding the rat D(1A) receptor. Basal adenylyl cyclase activity increased 50 to 60% in membranes of transfected PC2 cells compared with control membranes. The dopaminergic antagonists clozapine, cis-flupenthixol, (+)-butaclamol, haloperidol, chlorpromazine, and fluphenazine inhibited constitutive adenylyl cyclase activity in membranes of cells expressing the D(1A) receptor. SCH23390, a selective D(1) dopamine receptor antagonist, and (-)-butaclamol did not alter basal cyclase activity, whereas dopamine increased enzyme activity in membranes expressing the D(1A) dopamine receptor. The coupling of D(1A) receptors with G(s) proteins was examined by immunoprecipitation of membrane G(salpha) followed by immunoblotting with a D(1A) dopamine receptor monoclonal antibody. Clozapine, cis-flupenthixol, (+)-butaclamol, haloperidol, and fluphenazine but not SCH23390 or (-)-butaclamol decreased D(1A) receptor-G(salpha) coupling by 70 to 80%, and SCH23390 was able to prevent the receptor-G(salpha) uncoupling induced by haloperidol or clozapine. These results indicate that some dopaminergic antagonists suppress basal signal transduction and behave as inverse agonists at the D(1A) dopamine receptor. This action of the dopamine receptor antagonists may contribute to their antidopaminergic properties that seem to underlie their clinical actions as antipsychotic drugs.",

        "abstract": "Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs), either plant constituents or contaminants deriving from industrial products, may interfere with the thyroid hormone (TH) axis. Here, we examined whether selected EDCs inhibit the key reactions of TH biosynthesis catalyzed by thyroid peroxidase (TPO). We used a novel in vitro assay based on human recombinant TPO (hrTPO) stably transfected into the human follicular thyroid carcinoma cell line FTC-238. F21388 (synthetic flavonoid), bisphenol A (building block for polycarbonates), and the UV filter benzophenone 2 (BP2) inhibited hrTPO. BP2 is contained in numerous cosmetics of daily use and may be in regular contact with human skin. Half-maximal inhibition in the guaiacol assay occurred at 450 nmol/liter BP2, a concentration 20- and 200-fold lower than those required in case of the TPO-inhibiting antithyroid drugs methimazole and propylthiouracil, respectively. BP2 at 300 nmol/liter combined with the TPO substrate H(2)O(2) (10 mumol/liter) inactivated hrTPO; this was, however, prevented by micromolar amounts of iodide. BP2 did not inhibit iodide uptake into FRTL-5 cells. In BP2-treated rats (333 and 1000 mg/kg body weight), serum total T(4) was significantly decreased and serum thyrotropin was significantly increased. TPO activities in the thyroids of treated animals were unchanged, a finding also described for methimazole and propylthiouracil. Thus, EDCs, most potently BP2, may disturb TH homeostasis by inhibiting or inactivating TPO, effects that are even more pronounced in the absence of iodide. This new challenge for endocrine regulation must be considered in the context of a still prevailing iodide deficiency in many parts of the world.",

N,N'-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET) is the active ingredient in most insect repellents and is thought to interact synergistically with PB. Since PB can inhibit the binding of organophosphates to tubulin and since organophosphates inhibit microtubule assembly, we decided to examine the effects of PB and DEET on microtubule assembly as well as their interactions with tubulin, the subunit protein of microtubules. We found that PB binds to tubulin with an apparent Kd of about 60 microM. PB also inhibits microtubule assembly in vitro, although at higher concentrations PB induces formation of tubulin aggregates of high absorbance. Like PB, DEET is a weak inhibitor of microtubule assembly and also induces formation of tubulin aggregates. Many tubulin ligands stabilize the conformation of tubulin as measured by exposure of sulfhydryl groups and hydrophobic areas and stabilization of colchicine binding. PB appears to have very little effect on tubulin conformation, and DEET appears to have no effect. Neither compound interferes with colchicine binding to tubulin. Our results raise the possibility that PB and DEET may exert some of their effects in vivo by interfering with microtubule assembly or function, although high intracellular levels of these compounds would be required.",

The efficacy of bosentan, a mixed ETA-ETB endothelin receptor antagonist, in protecting the myocardium from ischemia-reperfusion injury and oxidative stress was studied in open-chest Wistar rats. Anesthetized adult male rats (175-250 g b wt) underwent sham operation (SHAM group) or were subjected to 40 min of myocardial ischemia (MI) induced by temporary occlusion of the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD) followed by 2 h reperfusion (R). Rats submitted to the MI-R protocol were administered bosentan at a dose of 3 mg/kg i.v. 20 min (BOS group) or saline (CON group) 20 min post-occlusion of LAD. After the 2 h reperfusion period the animals were euthanized and the heart rapidly excised. Cardiac tissue samples were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen for biochemical assay and were fixed in 10% formalin solution for histologic evaluation. Myocardial I-R resulted in a significant increase (p &lt; 0.05) in the myocardial malondialdehyde levels and a decrease (p &lt; 0.01) in the myocardial reduced glutathione content. These changes were associated with significant decreases in the myocardial activity of antioxidant enzymes superoxide dismutase (p &lt; 0.05) and catalase (p &lt; 0.01) and severe tissue damage in the jeopardized myocardium in the CON group as compared with the non-myocardial ischemia-reperfusion (NMI-R) SHAM group. Bosentan exerted marked tissue protective effect as assessed by histologic evaluation of the myocardium. The drug significantly (p &lt; 0.05) attenuated myocardial oxidative stress and restored the cellular antioxidant defense mechanisms as compared with the saline-treated controls subjected to the MI-R protocol. Furthermore, bosentan also exerted a marked effect on peripheral hemodynamics and heart rate during the reperfusion phase (data reported elsewhere). These results are consistent with the concept that endothelin-1 may be involved in the pathogenesis of myocardial ischemia and infarction. This study demonstrates the antioxidant effect of non-selective endothelin receptor antagonism elucidating that, part of the aetiology of ischemia and reperfusion induced myocardial injury involves impaired antioxidant defenses.",

Then follicles were exposed to MMI or PTU in the presence of 0.1 microM Kl for 2 days. TPO activity was measured in the 100,000 x g-pellet of the thyroid sonicate by the guaiacol oxidation method. Exposure to MMI (1 microM and 10 microM) or PTU (10 microM and 100 microM) for 2 days caused a significant increase in cellular TPO activity; 100 microM MMI inhibited cellular TPO activity. The presence of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-generating system (forskolin) in TSH-free medium increased MMI-mediated TPO activity. Cyclohexamide inhibited MMI-mediated TPO activation, indicating that new protein synthesis is required for increased TPO activity. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) showed an increase in TPO mRNA by PTU or MMI. In conclusion, MMI and PTU at therapeutic concentrations can increase TPO mRNA and cellular TPO activity, although the 2 drugs inhibit the TPO-H2O2-mediated catalytic reaction.",

        "title": "A reexamination of the proposed inactivation of thyroid peroxidase in the rat thyroid by propylthiouracil.",
        "abstract": "The antithyroid drug 6-propylthiouracil (PTU) was previously shown in our laboratory to have an unexpectedly prolonged inhibitory effect on iodination in the thyroid glands of rats. Eighteen hours after injection of a relatively small dose, iodination in the thyroid remained inhibited by more than 90%. We previously suggested that the prolonged inhibitory effect might be due to inactivation of thyroid peroxidase (TPO), a reaction previously shown to occur under certain conditions in an in vitro iodinating system containing highly purified TPO. However, the analytical procedure used in our earlier study did not exclude the possibility that sufficient PTU remained in the thyroid even after 18 h to inhibit TPO-catalyzed iodination by a reversible mechanism. Development of an improved analytical procedure, based on HPLC, led us to reexamine the mechanism of the prolonged inhibitory effect of PTU on iodination in rat thyroid glands. Rats were injected with [35S]PTU (1 mumol/100 g BW), and ultrafiltrates prepared from their homogenized thyroid glands were analyzed by HPLC. The major 35S-labeled metabolites were identified as sulfate/sulfite, PTU sulfinate, and PTU sulfonate. However, even after 18 h, a significant amount of unchanged [35S]PTU was also present. The calculated mean concentration of residual PTU was 20 microM, a sufficiently high level to explain the observed inhibition of iodination on the basis of a reversible mechanism. Experiments were also performed to examine the intrathyroidal distribution of 35S at intervals after the injection of [35S]PTU. All of the oxidation products of PTU showed marked increases between 2 and 16 h after injection. Based on our view that TPO is the major mediator of intrathyroidal metabolism of PTU, this observation is inconsistent with our previous proposal that TPO is inactivated after PTU injection. The results of the present study, therefore, lead us to withdraw our previous suggestion that TPO is inactivated after injection of PTU into rats. It is more likely that inhibition of iodination by PTU in the rat thyroid involves competition between PTU and tyrosyl residues of thyroglobulin for oxidized iodine, comparable to the reversible mechanism of inhibition observed in the TPO model system.",

        "abstract": "We examined the antisecretory and antilesion activities of nizatidine in rats. Male SD or Donryu rats (200-260 g) were used under fasted or fed conditions. Nizatidine, given orally or parenterally (intraperitoneally, subcutaneously or intraduodenally) at 0.3-150 mg/kg, inhibited both basal (pylorus-ligation preparations) and histamine-stimulated gastric acid secretion (acute fistula preparations) in a dose-dependent manner. The potency of nizatidine was 2 to 8 times greater than cimetidine when the ED50 values (mg/kg or mu mole/kg) of each agent were compared. The antisecretory activity of nizatidine, given orally, persisted for more than 3.5 hr, but disappeared 6 hr later. Nizatidine, given orally or subcutaneously at 0.3-150 mg/kg, prevented development of gastric lesions induced by water immersion, pylorus ligation (Shay), histamine, aspirin, or indomethacin in a dose-dependent manner. Duodenal ulcers induced by mepirizole were also markedly prevented with nizatidine. The potency of nizatidine on stress lesions or duodenal ulcers was about 20 or 14 times greater than that of cimetidine, respectively. Nizatidine, given orally 3 times a day for 4 weeks, significantly (P less than 0.05) accelerated the healing of acetic acid-induced gastric ulcers which were delayed by prolonged treatment with indomethacin. These results suggest that nizatidine is a useful drug for the treatment of peptic ulcers in man.",

Based upon the hypothesis that serotonin (5-HT)-steroid hormone interactions are important in mood regulation, we have compared six SERMs (tamoxifen, raloxifene, levormeloxifene, NNC 45-0781, NNC 45-0320, NNC 45-1506) with 17beta-estradiol (E(2)) in terms of their ability to regulate mRNA levels of estrogen receptor (ER)alpha, ER beta, 5-HT(1A) receptor, and 5-HT reuptake transporter (SERT) in the midbrain, amygdala, and hypothalamus of ovariectomized (OVX) rats. Female rats (n = 6/group, 8 groups total) were OVX and allowed to recover for 2 weeks. During the third post-OVX week, rats were injected subcutaneously with E(2) (0.1 mg/kg) or one of the SERMs (5 mg/kg) once per day for 7 days. Twenty-four hours after the last injection, tissue was collected for the determination of mRNA levels by ribonuclease protection assay (RPA). E(2) treatment significantly decreased mRNA levels for ER alpha, ER beta, and SERT in midbrain and ER alpha in hypothalamus. Tamoxifen increased ER beta mRNA levels in hypothalamus, while raloxifene increased ER beta mRNA levels in amygdala. NNC 45-0320 decreased ER alpha mRNA in hypothalamus and decreased ER beta mRNA in amygdala. These results suggest that while SERMs are not full estrogen receptor agonists in the brain, the agonist/antagonist profiles for individual SERMs may differ among brain areas. This raises the possibility of developing new SERMs for selective functions in specific brain areas.",

        "abstract": "The purpose of the present study was to test our hypothesis that amiloride, a specific u-PA inhibitor, effectively decreases u-PA activity in cornea as well as in tear fluid and favourably affects corneal healing. Therefore, comparative histochemical and biochemical studies of u-PA and the effects of amiloride were performed on rabbit corneas and tear fluid using the sensitive fluorogenic substrate Z-Gly-Gly-Arg-7-amino-4-trifluoromethylcoumarin. Rabbit eyes were repeatedly irradiated with UVB for 9 days and during the irradiation topically treated with amiloride (1 mg/ml saline) or placebo (saline) (dropwise, 5 times daily). Results show that in placebo-treated eyes, UVB evoked the appearance of u-PA activity in cornea and tear fluid in early stages of irradiation, and u-PA levels increased during irradiation. Corneal epithelium was gradually lost and remnants of the epithelium as well as keratocytes in the upper part of corneal stroma showed high u-PA activity. Finally, corneas lost their epithelium completely. In corneal stroma, numerous u-PA-containing inflammatory cells were present. Corneas were vascularized. When amiloride was dropped on the eye surface on the first day of irradiation and subsequently daily until the end of the experiment, u-PA activity in both cornea and tear fluid was strongly inhibited. Corneas were covered with a continuous epithelium until the end of the experiment. The number of inflammatory cells was significantly decreased. Corneal vascularization was reduced by 50%. In conclusion, early application of amiloride inhibited u-PA activity in UVB-irradiated corneas as well as in tear fluid and diminished the development of corneal pathology.",

The endosomal acidification inhibitors, chloroquine or bafilomycin A, inhibited CpG ODN-induced TNF-alpha, TNFR-II, and MMP-9 expression. CpG ODN induced the phosphorylation of Akt, and the inhibition of Akt by LY294002 suppressed CpG ODN-induced TNF-alpha, TNFR-II, and MMP-9 expressions. Moreover, neutralizing TNF-alpha antibody significantly suppressed CpG ODN-induced MMP-9 expression, suggesting the involvement of TNF-alpha.

The discovery of high mobility group box 1 (HMGB1) as a late mediator of lethal sepsis has prompted investigation into the development of new therapeutics which specifically target this protein. Here, we show that chloroquine, an anti-malarial drug, prevents lethality in mice with established endotoxemia or sepsis. This effect is still observed even if administration of chloroquine is delayed. The protective effects of chloroquine were mediated through inhibition of HMGB1 release in macrophages, monocytes, and endothelial cells, thereby preventing its cytokine-like activities. As an inhibitor of autophagy, chloroquine specifically inhibited HMGB1-induced Ikappa-B degradation and NF-kappaB activation. These findings define a novel mechanism for the anti-inflammatory effects of chloroquine and also suggest a new potential clinical use for this drug in the setting of sepsis.",

        "abstract": "Raloxifene, a selective estrogen receptor (ER) modulator, is a mixed estrogen agonist/antagonist that has been shown to prevent osteoporosis and breast cancer in women. Because the prostate contains a high level of ER-beta, the present study investigated the effect of raloxifene in the androgen-sensitive human prostate cancer cell line LNCaP. Previously, it has been demonstrated that LNCaP cells express ER-beta but not ER-alpha and that tamoxifene induces apoptosis in these cells. After treatment with raloxifene, a dramatic increase in cell death occurred in a dose-dependent manner (10(-9) to 10(-6) M range). Using the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated nick end labeling apoptotic assay, we demonstrated that the nuclear fragmentation was due to apoptosis. The dramatic change in cellular morphology after treatment with raloxifene was no longer observed when cells were pretreated with a pan-caspase inhibitor, Z-VAD-FMK, and a specific caspase-9 inhibitor, Z-LEHD-FMK. Furthermore, immunoblot demonstrated an activation of caspase-9 in LNCaP cells. Because LNCaP cells contain a mutated androgen receptor that allows cellular proliferation in the presence of antiandrogens, prostate-specific antigen assay and transfection with a reporter construct containing luciferase gene under the control of androgen response element (pARE) were carried out. The results demonstrated that raloxifene does not significantly alter androgen receptor activity in LNCaP cells. Taken together, these results demonstrate that raloxifene, a selective ER modulator, induces apoptosis in the androgen-sensitive human prostate cancer cell line LNCaP through an androgen-independent pathway.",

Quercetin, the major pentahydroxyflavone, was observed to inhibit human lens aldose reductase by 50% at a concentration of 5 X 10(-6) M. The inhibitory activity of its 3-O-glucoside was similar to that of the parent aglycon. Glycosidation with L-sugar (quercitrin and guaijaverin), however, improved the inhibitory activity (the IC50 values being 1 X 10(-6) M and 2.5 X 10(-6) M respectively). The improvement in inhibitory activity with glycosidation with L-sugar was also apparent from the high inhibitory activity of myricitrin as compared to myricetin, although the improvement in this case of hexahydroxy flavone glycosidation was significantly less than in the case of penthahydroxy flavone glycosidation. The structure-activity relationship observed for human lens enzyme was similar to that reported previously for rat lens enzyme. Inhibitory activity on the whole however, was lower with human lens enzyme. Some known inhibitors of cyclo-oxygenase such as indomethacin, aspirin and sulindac also inhibited human lens aldose reductase. Thus, an inhibitor of one of the enzymes may actually inhibit both and, when administered, may exert mixed physiological effects.",

A few smaller studies have shown beneficial effects on the symptoms of allergic conjunctivitis and chronic urticaria (but not atopic dermatitis). While astemizole appears to share with other H1-histamine receptor antagonists a tendency to increase appetite and cause weight gain after prolonged use, it offers the important advantage of an absence of significant central nervous system depression or anticholinergic effects with usual doses.

Celecoxib and rofecoxib were among the molecules developed from these efforts. We report here the pharmacological properties of a third selective COX-2 inhibitor, valdecoxib, which is the most potent and in vitro selective of the marketed COX-2 inhibitors that we have studied. Recombinant human COX-1 and COX-2 were used to screen for new highly potent and in vitro selective COX-2 inhibitors and compare kinetic mechanisms of binding and enzyme inhibition with other COX inhibitors. Valdecoxib potently inhibits recombinant COX-2, with an IC(50) of 0.005 microM; this compares with IC values of 0.05 microM for celecoxib, 0.5 microM for rofecoxib, and 5 microM for etoricoxib. Unique binding interactions of valdecoxib with COX-2 translate into a fast rate of inactivation of COX-2 (110,000 M/s compared with 7000 M/s for rofecoxib and 80 M/s for etoricoxib). The overall saturation binding affinity for COX-2 of valdecoxib is 2.6 nM (compared with 1.6 nM for celecoxib, 51 nM for rofecoxib, and 260 nM for etoricoxib), with a slow off-rate (t(1/2) approximately 98 min). Valdecoxib inhibits COX-1 in a competitive fashion only at very high concentrations (IC(50) = 150 microM). Collectively, these data provide a mechanistic basis for the potency and in vitro selectivity of valdecoxib for COX-2. Valdecoxib showed similar activity in the human whole-blood COX assay (COX-2 IC(50) = 0.24 microM; COX-1 IC(50) = 21.9 microM). We also determined whether this in vitro potency and selectivity translated to significant potency in vivo. In rats, valdecoxib demonstrated marked potency in acute and chronic models of inflammation (air pouch ED(50) = 0.06 mg/kg; paw edema ED(50) = 5.9 mg/kg; adjuvant arthritis ED(50) = 0.03 mg/kg). In these same animals, COX-1 was spared at doses greater than 200 mg/kg. These data provide a basis for the observed potent anti-inflammatory activity of valdecoxib in humans.",

Galantamine has been licensed for use in the symptomatic treatment of Alzheimer's disease patients, after proving its efficacy in a number of well-designed clinical trials. It has to be administered twice daily and has shown good tolerability, which typically for drugs of this class, is improved by slow titration.

Novobiocin at 500 micrograms/ml or at higher concentrations irreversibly inactivated DNA polymerase alpha primase complex. The accuracy of in vitro DNA synthesis in the absence of repair mechanisms was determined from amber-revertant assays with phi X174am16(+) DNA as template. The antimicrobial agents did not significantly increase the frequencies of base pairing mismatches during the course of replication, indicating that the basal mutation rate is not affected by novobiocin and the 4-quinolones.

The antinociceptive effects of (+/-)pentazocine in both diabetic and non-diabetic mice were significantly antagonized by s.c. administration of nor-binaltorphimine, a selective kappa-opioid receptor antagonist. On the other hand, the antinociceptive effects of (+/-)pentazocine were potentiated when non-diabetic mice were pretreated with beta-funaltrexamine, a selective mu-opioid receptor antagonist. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in the antinociceptive effect of (+/-)pentazocine between diabetic mice and beta-funaltrexamine-treated non-diabetic mice.

Determinants of binding specificity of spironolactone to the MR were investigated using chimeras created between the ligand-binding domains (LBDs) of the MR and the GR. These chimeras had previously been used to investigate aldosterone binding specificity to the MR. Spironolactone was able to compete strongly for [(3)H]-aldosterone and [(3)H]-dexamethasone binding to a chimera containing amino acids 804-874 of the MR, and weakly for [(3)H]-dexamethasone binding to a chimera containing amino acids 672-803 of the MR. Amino acids 804-874 were also critical for aldosterone binding specificity. Models of the MR LBD bound to aldosterone and spironolactone were created based on the crystal structure of the progesterone receptor LBD. The ligand-binding pocket of the MR LBD model consisted of 23 amino acids and was predominantly hydrophobic in nature. Analysis of this model in light of the experimental data suggested that spironolactone binding specificity is not governed by amino acids in the ligand-binding pocket.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Aprepitant is a novel neurokinin 1 (NK(1)) antagonist that has been shown to improve control of chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) when added to a standard antiemetic regimen of a 5-hydroxytriptamine-3 antagonist plus a corticosteroid. The authors sought to evaluate further the efficacy and tolerability of aprepitant plus standard therapy in a large clinical trial. METHODS: This was a multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-groups, Phase III study. Patients with cancer who were scheduled to receive treatment with high-dose cisplatin chemotherapy were randomized to receive 1 of 2 treatment regimens; the standard therapy group received intravenous ondansetron 32 mg and oral dexamethasone 20 mg on Day 1, and oral dexamethasone 8 mg twice daily on Days 2-4. The aprepitant group received oral aprepitant 125 mg, intravenous ondansetron 32 mg, and oral dexamethasone 12 mg on Day 1; oral aprepitant 80 mg and oral dexamethasone 8 mg once daily on Days 2-3; and oral dexamethasone 8 mg on Day 4. Patients recorded episodes of emesis, use of rescue therapy, and severity of nausea in a diary. A modified intent-to-treat approach was used to analyze the efficacy data. The primary endpoint was complete response (no emesis and no rescue therapy) during the 5-day period postcisplatin. Treatment comparisons were made using logistic regression models, and reported adverse events and physical and laboratory assessments were used to assess tolerability. RESULTS: A total of 523 patients were evaluated for efficacy, and 568 patients were evaluated for safety. During the 5 days after chemotherapy, the percentages of patients who achieved a complete response were 62.7% in the aprepitant group (163 of 260 patients) versus 43.3% in the standard therapy group (114 of 263 patients; P &lt; 0.001). For Day 1, the complete response rates were 82.8% for the aprepitant group and 68.4% for the standard therapy group (P &lt; 0.001); for Days 2-5, the complete response rates were 67.7% in the aprepitant group and 46.8% in the standard therapy group (P &lt; 0.001). The overall incidence of adverse events was similar between the 2 treatment groups (72.8% in the aprepitant group [206 of 283 patients] and 72.6% in the standard therapy group [207 of 285 patients]) as were rates of serious adverse events, discontinuations due to adverse events, and deaths. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with cancer who are receiving high-dose cisplatin-based chemotherapy, therapy consisting of aprepitant (125 mg on Day 1 and 80 mg on Days 2-3) plus a standard regimen of ondansetron and dexamethasone provided superior antiemetic protection compared with standard therapy alone and was generally well tolerated.",

        "title": "Selective inhibitors of butyrylcholinesterase: a valid alternative for therapy of Alzheimer's disease?",
        "abstract": "The brain of mammals contains two major forms of cholinesterases (ChEs): acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE). The two forms differ genetically, structurally and in their kinetics. Butyrylcholine is not a physiological substrate in mammalian brains which makes the function of BuChE difficult to interpret. In human brains, BuChE is found in neurons and glial cells as well as in neuritic plaques and tangles in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD). While AChE activity decreases progressively in the brain of patients with AD, BuChE activity shows some increase. In order to study the function of BuChE, we perfused intracortically the rat brain with a selective BuChE inhibitor. We found that extracellular acetylcholine levels increased 15-fold from 5 nmol/L to 75 nmol/L concentrations, with little cholinergic adverse effect in the animal. Based on these data, we postulated that two pools of ChEs may be present in the brain: one mainly neuronal and AChE dependent; and one mainly glial and BuChE dependent. The two pools show different kinetic properties with regard to regulation of acetylcholine concentration in the brain and can be separated with selective inhibitors. The recent development of highly selective BuChE inhibitors will allow us to test these new agents in patients with AD in order to find out whether or not they represent an advantage for the treatment of patients with AD as compared with selective (donepezil) or relatively non-selective (rivastigmine, galantamine) ChE inhibitors presently in use. The association between a BuChE-K variant and AD has not been confirmed in several studies. In conclusion, additional experimental and clinical work is necessary in order to elucidate the role of BuChE in normal brain function and in the brains of patients with AD. In the future, it may be possible that selective BuChE inhibitors will have a role in treatment of patients with advanced AD.",

In the present studies, cytosol preparations of colon or hippocampus were incubated with [3H]aldosterone or [3H]progesterone, alone or with excess RU-486, and the ability of each steroid to compete for MR was determined. In guinea pigs, progesterone has equivalent affinity to aldosterone for MR in vitro, and in rats three times of that aldosterone, with no differences between tissues. In vivo, in both epithelial (kidney, colon) and nonepithelial tissues (heart, hippocampus), progesterone was 10- to 100-fold less potent a competitor than aldosterone for MR, both in the absence of transcortin (8-day-old rats) and in adult mice. Bolus injection of [3H]progesterone was not specifically bound in any of the four tissues. Whether progesterone at steady state may bid for MR occupancy under conditions of high circulating free levels (in utero, luteal phase, pregnancy), presumably to act as an antagonist to cortisol/corticosterone in unprotected nonepithelial receptors, thus remains to be determined.",

        "abstract": "Nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTI) are a group of structurally diverse compounds that bind to a single site in HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT), termed the NNRTI-binding pocket (NNRTI-BP). NNRTI binding to RT induces conformational changes in the enzyme that affect key elements of the polymerase active site and also the association between the two protein subunits. To determine which conformational changes contribute to the mechanism of inhibition of HIV-1 reverse transcription, we used transient kinetic analyses to probe the catalytic events that occur directly at the enzyme's polymerase active site when the NNRTI-BP was occupied by nevirapine, efavirenz, or delavirdine. Our results demonstrate that all NNRTI-RT-template/primer (NNRTI-RT-T/P) complexes displayed a metal-dependent increase in dNTP binding affinity (K(d) ) and a metal-independent decrease in the maximum rate of dNTP incorporation (k (pol)). The magnitude of the decrease in k (pol) was dependent on the NNRTI used in the assay: Efavirenz caused the largest decrease followed by delavirdine and then nevirapine. Analyses that were designed to probe direct effects on phosphodiester bond formation suggested that the NNRTI mediate their effects on the chemistry step of the DNA polymerization reaction via an indirect manner. Because each of the NNRTI analyzed in this study exerted largely similar phenotypic effects on single nucleotide addition reactions, whereas each of them are known to exert differential effects on RT dimerization, we conclude that the NNRTI effects on subunit association do not directly contribute to the kinetic mechanism of inhibition of DNA polymerization.",

The synthesized compounds were evaluated for their ability to inhibit mammalian DHFR in vitro and for their antitumor activity in a standard in vitro tissue culture assay panel.

        "abstract": "Tardive dyskinesia develops as a common complication of long-term neuroleptic use. The emergence of such dyskinesias may reflect a shift in the balance of dopamine D(1) and D(2) receptor-mediated activity, with a relative increase in activity in the D(1) receptor-regulated direct striatonigral pathway. In rats, chronic treatment with the antipsychotic fluphenazine triggers a syndrome of vacuous chewing movements, which are attenuated by dopamine D(1) receptor antagonists. A similar syndrome can be seen in drug-naive animals following acute administration of selective dopamine D(1) receptor agonists. However, not all dopamine D(1) receptor agonists elicit these mouth movements. Thus, some investigators have suggested the existence of novel subtypes of the dopamine D(1) receptor. In these studies, we sought to clarify the role of the dopamine D(1A) receptor in vacuous chewing movements induced both by the selective dopamine D(1) receptor agonist SKF 38393, as well as by chronic neuroleptic administration, using in vivo oligonucleotide antisense to dopamine D(1A) receptor messenger RNA. Intrastriatal antisense treatment significantly and selectively attenuated striatal dopamine D(1) receptor binding, accompanied by reductions in SKF 38393- and chronic fluphenazine-induced vacuous chewing movements. These findings suggest that the dopamine D(1A) receptor plays an important role in the expression of vacuous chewing movements in a rodent model of tardive dyskinesia and may contribute to the pathogenesis of the human disorder. This may have important implications for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia in humans.",

        "abstract": "beta-adrenergic receptors (betaAR) regulate numerous functions throughout the body, however G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK)-dependent desensitization of betaAR has long been recognized as a maladaptive process in the progression of various disease states. Thus, the development of small molecule inhibitors of GRKs for the study of these processes and as potential therapeutics has been at the forefront of recent research efforts. Via structural and biochemical analyses, the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) paroxetine was identified as a GRK2 inhibitor that enhances betaAR-dependent cardiomyocyte and cardiac contractility and reverses cardiac dysfunction and myocardial betaAR expression in mouse models of heart failure. Despite these functional outcomes, consistent with diminished betaAR desensitization, the proximal betaAR signaling mechanisms sensitive to paroxetine have not been reported. In this study, we aimed to determine whether paroxetine prevents classic betaAR desensitization-related signaling mechanisms at a molecular level. Therefore, via immunoblotting, radioligand binding, fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and microscopy assays, we have performed an assessment of the effect of paroxetine on proximal betaAR signaling responses. Indeed, paroxetine treatment inhibited ligand-induced beta2AR phosphorylation in a concentration-dependent manner. Additionally, for both beta1AR and beta2AR, paroxetine decreased ligand-induced betaarrestin2 recruitment and subsequent receptor internalization. Thus, paroxetine inhibits betaAR desensitization mechanisms consistent with GRK2 inhibition and provides a useful pharmacological tool for studying these proximal GPCR signaling responses.",

The inhibitor binds at the base of the active site gorge of TcAChE, interacting with both the choline-binding site (Trp-84) and the acyl-binding pocket (Phe-288, Phe-290). The tertiary amine group of GAL does not interact closely with Trp-84; rather, the double bond of its cyclohexene ring stacks against the indole ring. The tertiary amine appears to make a non-conventional hydrogen bond, via its N-methyl group, to Asp-72, near the top of the gorge. The hydroxyl group of the inhibitor makes a strong hydrogen bond (2.7 A) with Glu-199. The relatively tight binding of GAL to TcAChE appears to arise from a number of moderate to weak interactions with the protein, coupled to a low entropy cost for binding due to the rigid nature of the inhibitor.",

        "abstract": "Although agonist binding in adrenergic receptors is fairly well understood and involves residues located in transmembrane domains 3 through 6, there are few residues reported that are involved in antagonist binding. In fact, a major docking site for antagonists has never been reported in any G-protein coupled receptor. It has been speculated that antagonist binding is quite diverse depending upon the chemical structure of the antagonist, which can be quite different from agonists. We now report the identification of two phenylalanine residues in transmembrane domain 7 of the alpha(1a)-adrenergic receptor (Phe-312 and Phe-308) that are a major site of antagonist affinity. Mutation of either Phe-308 or Phe-312 resulted in significant losses of affinity (4-1200-fold) for the antagonists prazosin, WB4101, BMY7378, (+) niguldipine, and 5-methylurapidil, with no changes in affinity for phenethylamine-type agonists such as epinephrine, methoxamine, or phenylephrine. Interestingly, both residues are involved in the binding of all imidazoline-type agonists such as oxymetazoline, cirazoline, and clonidine, confirming previous evidence that this class of ligand binds differently than phenethylamine-type agonists and may be more antagonist-like, which may explain their partial agonist properties. In modeling these interactions with previous mutagenesis studies and using the current backbone structure of rhodopsin, we conclude that antagonist binding is docked higher in the pocket closer to the extracellular surface than agonist binding and appears skewed toward transmembrane domain 7.",

        "abstract": "Recent evidence suggests that the dopamine D4 receptor may play a role in schizophrenia, and that the atypical properties of the antipsychotic clozapine may be attributable in part to its antagonistic actions at this receptor. In the present study, clozapine and three other compounds having D4 dopamine receptor antagonist properties were examined for their effectiveness in reducing losses in prepulse inhibition (PPI) induced in rats by the dopamine receptor agonist apomorphine. Previously, activity in the PPI model has been shown to correlate highly with the antipsychotic potency of a number of neuroleptics. As previously reported, clozapine (1-5.6 mg/kg) significantly reduced apomorphine-induced PPI deficits. The three D4-selective compounds, CP-293,019 (5.6-17.8 mg/kg), U-101,387 (3-30 mg/kg) and L-745,870 (1-10 mg/kg), also significantly blocked the losses in PPI produced by apomorphine. Taken together, these results suggest that dopamine receptor antagonists with selectivity for the D4 dopamine receptor subtype may be effective in the treatment of schizophrenia, while being less likely to produce dyskinesias associated with D2 receptor antagonists.",

Spironolactone is a non-selective mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist with moderate affinity for both progesterone and androgen receptors. The latter property increases the likelihood of endocrine side effects with spironolactone including loss of libido, menstrual irregularities, gynecomastia and impotence. Eplerenone is a next generation aldosterone receptor antagonist selective for aldosterone receptors alone. This lesser affinity for progesterone and androgen receptors was arrived at by replacing the 17-alpha -thioacetyl group of spironolactone with a carbomethoxy group. Eplerenone is further distinguished from spironolactone by its shorter half-life and the fact that it does not have any active metabolites. Both eplerenone and spironolactone are effective antihypertensive agents and each has been shown to improve the morbidity and mortality of heart failure. Eplerenone or spironolactone use can increase serum potassium values and occasionally results in clinically relevant hyperkalemia. This is more apt to occur with spironolactone due to the very long half-life of several of its active metabolites.",

        "abstract": "Adenosine modulates a variety of physiological functions through interaction with A1 and A2 adenosine receptors, where agonists mediate inhibition and stimulation, respectively, of adenylate cyclase. In the cardiovascular system, A2 receptors mediate vasodilation and reduction in blood pressure, while A1 receptors mediate cardiac depression. The involvement of adenylate cyclase in these responses remains unresolved. Adenosine analogs in particular the N6-substituted compounds are more potent at A1 receptors than at A2 receptors. The subregion of the adenosine receptor that interacts with the N6-substituent is different for A1 and A2 receptors, particularly with respect to phenyl interactions, bulk tolerance and stereoselectivity. A series of para-substituted N6-phenyladenosines have been synthesized based on a \"functionalized congener\" approach in which a chemically reactive group, such as an amine or carboxylic acid, is introduced at the terminus of a chain. From the \"functionalized congener\" are synthesized a variety of conjugates each containing a common pharmacophore. Certain of the adenosine conjugates are highly selective for A1 receptors. Xanthines are classical antagonists for adenosine receptors for many of their pharmacological actions may be due to blockade of adenosine receptors. Caffeine and theophylline are virtually non-selective for A2 and A2 receptors. Replacement of the methyl groups of theophylline with n-propyl or larger alkyl groups yields xanthines with selectivity for A1 receptors, particularly when combined with an 8-phenyl moiety. Most 1,3-dialkyl-8-phenyl xanthines are very insoluble, but incorporation of polar aryl substituents, such as sulfo or carboxy to increase solubility, results in marked reduction in potency and selectivity. A new series of more hydrophilic 1,3-dipropyl-8-phenylxanthines has been synthesized using the \"functionalized congener\" approach. Certain conjugates of 8-[4-(carboxymethyloxy)phenyl 1]1,3-dipropylxanthine display A1 selectivity in biochemical and cardiovascular models. Certain analogs of caffeine in which the methyl group at the 1- or 7-position is replaced with a propargyl or propyl group display selectivity for A2 receptors. The profile of a series of adenosine analogs or of xanthine antagonists can be used to define the nature of adenosine receptors.",

        "title": "Atypical antipsychotics: mechanism of action.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Although the principal brain target that all antipsychotic drugs attach to is the dopamine D2 receptor, traditional or typical antipsychotics, by attaching to it, induce extrapyramidal signs and symptoms (EPS). They also, by binding to the D2 receptor, elevate serum prolactin. Atypical antipsychotics given in dosages within the clinically effective range do not bring about these adverse clinical effects. To understand how these drugs work, it is important to examine the atypical antipsychotics' mechanism of action and how it differs from that of the more typical drugs. METHOD: This review analyzes the affinities, the occupancies, and the dissociation time-course of various antipsychotics at dopamine D2 receptors and at serotonin (5-HT) receptors, both in the test tube and in live patients. RESULTS: Of the 31 antipsychotics examined, the older traditional antipsychotics such as trifluperazine, pimozide, chlorpromazine, fluphenazine, haloperidol, and flupenthixol bind more tightly than dopamine itself to the dopamine D2 receptor, with dissociation constants that are lower than that for dopamine. The newer, atypical antipsychotics such as quetiapine, remoxipride, clozapine, olanzapine, sertindole, ziprasidone, and amisulpride all bind more loosely than dopamine to the dopamine D2 receptor and have dissociation constants higher than that for dopamine. These tight and loose binding data agree with the rates of antipsychotic dissociation from the human-cloned D2 receptor. For instance, radioactive haloperidol, chlorpromazine, and raclopride all dissociate very slowly over a 30-minute time span, while radioactive quetiapine, clozapine, remoxipride, and amisulpride dissociate rapidly, in less than 60 seconds. These data also match clinical brain-imaging findings that show haloperidol remaining constantly bound to D2 in humans undergoing 2 positron emission tomography (PET) scans 24 hours apart. Conversely, the occupation of D2 by clozapine or quetiapine has mostly disappeared after 24 hours. CONCLUSION: Atypicals clinically help patients by transiently occupying D2 receptors and then rapidly dissociating to allow normal dopamine neurotransmission. This keeps prolactin levels normal, spares cognition, and obviates EPS. One theory of atypicality is that the newer drugs block 5-HT2A receptors at the same time as they block dopamine receptors and that, somehow, this serotonin-dopamine balance confers atypicality. This, however, is not borne out by the results. While 5-HT2A receptors are readily blocked at low dosages of most atypical antipsychotic drugs (with the important exceptions of remoxipride and amisulpride, neither of which is available for use in Canada) the dosages at which this happens are below those needed to alleviate psychosis. In fact, the antipsychotic threshold occupancy of D2 for antipsychotic action remains at about 65% for both typical and atypical antipsychotic drugs, regardless of whether 5-HT2A receptors are blocked or not. At the same time, the antipsychotic threshold occupancy of D2 for eliciting EPS remains at about 80% for both typical and atypical antipsychotics, regardless of the occupancy of 5-HT2A receptors. RELEVANCE: The \"fast-off-D2\" theory, on the other hand, predicts which antipsychotic compounds will or will not produce EPS and hyperprolactinemia and which compounds present a relatively low risk for tardive dyskinesia. This theory also explains why L-dopa psychosis responds to low atypical antipsychotic dosages, and it suggests various individualized treatment strategies.",

        "abstract": "Previous studies have demonstrated the virtual lack of analgesia in mu opioid receptor knockout mice after systemic administration of morphine. Thus, it has been suggested that analgesic actions of morphine are produced via the mu opioid receptor, despite its ability to bind to kappa and delta receptors in vitro. However, it is not clear whether the results of these studies reflect the effect of morphine in the spinal cord. In the present study, we report study of the analgesic actions of spinally-administered morphine and other opioid receptor agonists in mu opioid receptor knockout and wild type mice. Morphine produced a dose-dependent antinociceptive effect in the tail flick test in the knockout mice, although higher doses were needed to produce antinociception than in wild type mice. The antinociceptive effect of morphine was completely blocked by naloxone (a non-selective opioid antagonist) and nor-binaltorphimine (nor-BNI, a selective kappa-opioid receptor antagonist), but not by naltrindole (a selective delta-opioid receptor antagonist). U-50,488H (a selective kappa-opioid receptor agonist) also produced a dose-dependent antinociceptive effect in knockout mice but presented lower analgesic potency in knockout mice than in wild type mice. Analgesic effects of [d-Pen2,d-Pen5]enkephalin (DPDPE, a selective delta-opioid receptor agonist) were observed in wild type mice but abolished in knockout mice. SNC80 (a selective delta-opioid receptor agonist) was not antinociceptive even in wild type mice. The present study demonstrated that morphine can produce thermal antinociception via the kappa opioid receptor in the spinal cord in the absence of the mu opioid receptor. Lower potency of U50,488H in mu opioid receptor knockout mice suggests interaction between kappa and mu opioid receptors at the spinal level.",

        "abstract": "Synthetic local anesthetics (LAs) have been found to have cocaine-like characteristics with some psychotomimetic action, possibly through monoaminergic neurotransmission. To gain insight into the relation between LA action and monoamine transporters, we investigated the effect of synthetic LAs on neurotransmitter transporters, including monoamine transporters. We used cloned transporter cDNAs and examined transient functional expression in COS cells and stable expression in HeLa cells. Among the LAs tested, procaine and other ester-type LAs inhibited [3H]DA uptake and binding of [3H]2-beta-carbomethoxy-3-beta-(4-fluorophenyl)tropane (CFT), a cocaine analogue, in COS cells expressing rat dopamine transporter (DAT). The inhibition was concentration-dependent. The inhibitory effect on [3H]DA uptake was reversible and not dependent on pH, as observed in HeLa cells stably expressing DAT. Procaine also inhibited uptake of norepinephrine (NE) and serotonin (5-HT) by the norepinephrine transporter (NET) or serotonin transporter (SERT) expressed in COS cells. On the other hand, procaine and other LAs had little or no effect on [3H]GABA and [3H]glutamate uptake in COS cells expressing mouse GABA or rat glutamate/aspartate transporter. IC50 values for [3H]DA uptake inhibition correlated well with those for [3H]CFT binding inhibition, but not with intrinsic anesthetic potency. Kinetic analysis of monoamine uptake inhibition by procaine in COS cells expressing rat DAT, NET or SERT revealed a competitive action similar to that of cocaine. These results demonstrate that certain LAs selectively inhibit monoamine transporters. This might contribute to the cocaine-like psychotomimetic action of certain LAs.",

        "abstract": "The effect of a pro-erectile dose of apomorphine, a mixed dopamine receptor agonist, and of PD-168077 (N-[4-(2-cyanophenyl)piperazin-1-ylmethyl]-3-methylbenzamide maleate), a selective dopamine D4 receptor agonist, injected into the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus on the concentration of extra-cellular dopamine and its main metabolite 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid (DOPAC) in the dialysate from the nucleus accumbens was studied in male rats. As expected, apomorphine (0.1microg) and PD-168077 (0.1microg) induced penile erection episodes, which occurred concomitantly to an increase in extra-cellular dopamine and DOPAC concentration in the dialysate from the shell of the nucleus accumbens, as measured by intracerebral microdialysis. When induced by apomorphine, these effects were reduced by 80% by raclopride, a selective D2/D3 receptor antagonist (1microg) and only by 40-45% by L-745,870 (1microg), a selective dopamine D4 receptor antagonist. When induced by PD-168077, these effects were reduced by more than 80% by L-745,870 (1microg), but only by 35-40% by raclopride. Irrespective of the dopamine agonist used to induce penile erection, the pro-erectile effect and the concomitant increase in dopamine and DOPAC concentration in the nucleus accumbens dialysate were almost completely abolished by d(CH(2))(5)Tyr(Me)(2)-Orn(8)-vasotocin(1microg), a potent oxytocin receptor antagonist, given into the lateral ventricles. The present results suggest that stimulation of dopamine receptors (mainly of the D2 to D4 subtype) in the paraventricular nucleus induces the release of oxytocin in brain areas that influence the activity of mesolimbic dopaminergic neurons mediating the appetitive and reinforcing effects of sexual activity. This provides evidence for a role of oxytocin in neural circuits that integrate the activity of neural pathways controlling the consummatory aspects of sexual behaviour (e.g., penile erection) with those controlling sexual motivation and sexual arousal.",

Major emphasis was given in the use of these two and also of other chelators in conditions of iron overload, imbalance and toxicity, as well as the incidence and possible causes of toxic side effects in both animals and humans. The chemical basis of chelation and the interaction of these chelators with the iron pools are discussed within the context of clinical application in iron overload and other conditions such as renal dialysis, rheumatoid arthritis, cancer, heart disease, malaria, etc. The design and development of new orally active alpha-ketohydroxypyridine and other chelators are considered and compared with 14 other chelators which have been previously tested in man for the removal of iron, most of which, however, were later abandoned because of low efficacy or major toxicity. The design of new therapeutic protocols based on the pharmacological, toxicological and metabolic transformation properties of the chelating drugs is also being considered, within the context of maximising their efficacy and minimising their toxicity. Overall, oral deferiprone appears to be as effective as s.c. desferrioxamine in the removal of iron and aluminium in man and to have a similar but different toxicity profile from desferrioxamine in both animals and man. The low cost and oral activity of deferiprone will make it the drug of choice for the vast majority of patients, who are not currently being chelated either because they cannot afford the high cost of desferrioxamine therapy or are not complying or have toxic side effects with its s.c. administration.",

The DA turnover was reduced remarkably by diphenhydramine, tripelennamine, and promethazine, and also significantly by chlorpheniramine, mepyramine, clemizole, and homochlorcyclizine, at doses used in the ordinary animal experiments. The 5-HT turnover was reduced markedly by mepyramine, tripelennamine, and chlorpheniramine. In contrast, the NA turnover was increased by promethazine and homochlorcyclizine, possibly due to their antagonistic effects on alpha-adrenoceptors. These results suggest that (1) the degree of inhibition of the uptake of DA and 5-HT by histamine H1-receptor antagonists is considerably different, (2) most H1-antagonists have little influence on NA uptake and some compounds enhance NA release, and that (3) carbinoxamine, clemastine, triprolidine, and meclizine have comparatively weak influences on monoamine metabolism. These effects on brain monoamine systems may be related to some central actions of histamine H1-receptor antagonists, such as an addiction to these compounds combined with opioids.",

        "abstract": "Organophosphorus compounds (OPs) are used as pesticides and developed as warfare nerve agents such as tabun, soman, sarin, VX and others. Exposure to even small amounts of an OP can be fatal and death is usually caused by respiratory failure. The mechanism of OP poisoning involves inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) leading to inactivation of the enzyme which has an important role in neurotransmission. AChE inhibition results in the accumulation of acetylcholine at cholinergic receptor sites, producing continuous stimulation of cholinergic fibers throughout the nervous systems. During more than five decades, pyridinium oximes have been developed as therapeutic agents used in the medical treatment of poisoning with OP. They act by reactivation of AChE inhibited by OP. However, they differ in their activity in poisoning with pesticides and warfare nerve agents and there is still no universal broad-spectrum oxime capable of protecting against all known OP. In spite of enormous efforts devoted to development of new pyridinium oximes as potential antidotes against poisoning with OP only four compounds so far have found its application in human medicine. Presently, a combination of an antimuscarinic agent, e.g. atropine, AChE reactivator such as one of the recommended pyridinium oximes (pralidoxime, trimedoxime, obidoxime and HI-6) and diazepam are used for the treatment of OP poisoning in humans. In this article the available data related to medical treatment of poisoning with OP pesticides are reviewed and the current recommendations are presented.",

        "abstract": "The MAO inhibitor phenelzine (2-phenylethylhydrazine; PLZ) is used widely in psychiatry for the treatment of depression and panic disorder. Its N-acetyl metabolite, N2-acetylphenelzine (N2AcPLZ) is a reasonably potent nonselective inhibitor of monoamine oxidase (MAO) that causes elevation in brain levels of the biogenic amines. In the studies reported here, PLZ (0.05 mmol/kg/day), N2AcPLZ (0.10 mmol/kg/day) or vehicle were administered to male rats for 28 days s.c. with Alzet minipumps, and their effects on GABAergic function were examined. Whole brain concentrations of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) were significantly elevated in the PLZ but not in the N2AcPLZ-treated group. PLZ was found to inhibit the anabolic enzyme glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) and, to a greater extent, the catabolic enzyme GABA transaminase (GABA-T). The results of these investigations suggest that the free hydrazine moiety in PLZ is crucial to producing the elevated levels of GABA, probably through inhibition of GABA-T. Despite the considerable increase in whole brain GABA levels in the PLZ-treated rats, there were no significant differences in GABAA or benzodiazepine receptor binding parameters (KD or Bmax) between the groups as measured using 3H-muscimol and 3H-flunitrazepam in radioligand binding assays.",

        "abstract": "The organophosphorus insecticides, including malathion, are used indiscriminately in large amounts, causing environmental pollution and risk to human health. Classically, this toxicity is attributed mainly to the accumulation of acetylcholine (ACh), due to inhibition of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), and consequently overstimulation of the nicotinic and muscarinic receptors. The present study investigated the effects of acute and chronic malathion administration in immobility time in the forced swimming test (FST), open-field test and AChE activity in neural tissue of rats. Malathion was administered intraperitoneally once a day for one day (acute) or for 28 days (chronic) (in both protocols malathion was administered at 25, 50, 100 and 150 mg/kg). No significant effect was seen in immobility time in the FST after acute malathion treatment. The chronic malathion treatment induced an increase in the time of immobility in the FST. Both treatments do not interfere in locomotor activity evaluated in a novel environment. The inhibition of AChE activity was significant in the hippocampus (25, 50, 100 and 150 mg/kg), cortex (100 and 150 mg/kg) and striatum (150 mg/kg) after chronic treatment, but not significantly after acute treatment. These data suggest a possible interaction between increased immobility time in the FST and activation of cholinergic receptors by accumulated ACh subsequent to AChE inhibition.",

In the present study, we have examined the contribution of three variant forms of ABCG2 to SN-38 resistance. Exogenous expression of the Arg482 (wild type), Gly482, and Thr482 variants of ABCG2 conferred HEK293 cells resistance to SN-38 by 15.0-, 5.0-, and 5.3-fold, respectively. In plasma membrane vesicles prepared from the ABCG2 variant cDNA-transfected HEK293 cells, [Arg482]ABCG2 transported SN-38 and its glucuronide conjugate in an ATP-dependent manner; however, only minimal transport activities were observed with the other variants (Gly482 and Thr482). In addition, we have screened natural flavonoids to find potent inhibitors of [Arg482]ABCG2. Quercetin was found to be the strongest inhibitor (Ki = 0.28 microM) among natural flavonoids tested in the plasma membrane system in this study. When [Arg482]ABCG2-transfected HEK293 cells were incubated with SN-38 in the presence of 20 microM quercetin, cellular resistance to SN-38 was partly reversed. In this context, certain flavonoid derivatives are considered to be good candidates for development of ABCG2 inhibitors.",

Although some studies have reported neurotoxicity signs after the in utero exposure to OP pesticides, there is no evidence of the exclusive contribution of the lactational exposure to malathion as a possible cause of neurotoxicity in the offspring. In this study, we investigated the exclusive contribution of malathion exposure through maternal milk on the activity of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), as well as on biochemical parameters related to the oxidative stress (glutathione levels, lipid peroxidation and glutathione reductase and glutathione peroxidase activities) in the brain of suckling mice. The same parameters were also evaluated in the brains of the respective mothers, which where directly exposed to malathion during the lactational period (daily s.c. injections; doses of 20, 60 and 200mg/kg of body weight). Our results showed that the lactational exposure to malathion caused a high inhibitory effect of the brain AChE activity in the offspring, even when dams were exposed to the lowest malathion dose (20mg/kg). Brain AChE activity was also inhibited in mothers; however, only at the highest malathion dose (200mg/kg). No changes were observed in the biochemical parameters related to the oxidative stress for both dams and pups brains. The present study shows, for the first time, that the exposure of neonatal mice to malathion via lactation inhibits the activity of brain AChE in the offspring. These data, summed to the fact that OP pesticides are excreted in human milk, makes relevant the lactational exposure to these xenobiotics in terms of human health concerns.",

        "abstract": "Irinotecan (CPT-11, 7-ethyl-10-[4-(1-piperidino)-1-piperidino] carbonyloxycamptothecin) has exhibited clinical activities against a broad spectrum of carcinomas by inhibiting DNA topoisomerase I (Topo I). However, severe and unpredictable dosing-limiting toxicities (mainly myelosuppression and severe diarrhea) hinder its clinical use. The latter consists of early and late-onset diarrhea, occurring within 24 hr or &gt; or = 24 hr after CPT-11 administration, respectively. This review highlights novel agents potentially inhibiting CPT-11-induced diarrhea, which are designed and tested under guidance of disposition pathways and potential toxicity mechanisms. Early-onset diarrhea is observed immediately after CPT-11 infusion and probably due to the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase activity, which can be eliminated by administration of atropine. Late-onset diarrhea appears to be associated with intestinal exposure to SN-38 (7-ethyl-10-hydroxycamptothecin), the major active metabolite of CPT-11, which may bind to Topo I and induce apoptosis of intestinal epithelia, leading to the disturbance in the absorptive and secretory functions of mucosa. CPT-11 and SN-38 may also stimulate the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and prostaglandins (PGs), thus inducing the secretion of Na(+) and Cl(-). Early treatment of severe late-onset diarrhea with oral high-dose loperamide has decreased patient morbidity. Extensive studies have been conducted to identify other potential agents to ameliorate diarrhea in preclinical and clinical models. These include intestinal alkalizing agents, oral antibiotics, enzyme inducers, P-glycoprotein (PgP) inhibitors, cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) inhibitors, or blockers of biliary excretion of SN-38. Further studies are needed to identify the molecular targets associated with CPT-11 toxicity and safe and effective agents for alleviating CPT-11-induced diarrhea.",

With few exceptions all xanthine derivatives with 7-position substituents such as diprophylline, proxyfylline, pentoxifylline and etofylline were less potent antagonists than xanthine itself which had Ki-values of 170 mumol/l (A1) and 93 mumol/l (A2). Theophylline, caffeine and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine were more potent than xanthine but nearly equipotent antagonists at both receptor subtypes. 8-Phenyl substituents considerably increased the antagonist potency at A1 and A2 receptors. 1,3-Diethyl-8-phenylxanthine was the most potent A2 antagonist (Ki 0.2 mumol/l) in human platelets. At A1 receptors 1,3-dipropyl-8-(2-amino-4-chlorophenyl)xanthine (PACPX) was the most potent antagonist in all three tissues with Ki-values from 0.3 to 8.6 nmol/l. Several 8-phenylxanthine derivatives were remarkably selective antagonists at A1 receptors. 8-Phenyltheophylline was approximately 700 times more potent as antagonist at A1 receptors (bovine brain) than at A2 receptors (human platelets), and PACPX was even 1,600 times more potent as A1 adenosine receptor antagonist. These compounds offer a possibility for a subtype-selective blockade of adenosine receptors.",

        "abstract": "Butorphanol and nalbuphine have substantial affinity for mu and kappa-opioid receptor sites, yet their behavioral effects in monkeys are largely consistent with a mu receptor mechanism of action. Using ethylketocyclazocine (EKC) discrimination and diuresis assays in rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta), the purpose of the current investigation was to characterize the in vivo kappa-opioid activity of these compounds through the use of an insurmountable mu-opioid receptor antagonist, clocinnamox. Alone, butorphanol (0.001-0.032 mg/kg i.m.) failed to generalize to EKC, and pretreatment with the competitive opioid receptor antagonist quadazocine (0.1 or 0.32 mg/kg i.m.) did not alter this generalization. At 24 h after clocinnamox (0.1 mg/kg i.m.) administration, butorphanol fully generalized to EKC, and this generalization was maintained in two of three monkeys at 72 h. Parallel results were observed in diuresis: butorphanol alone and in the presence of quadazocine (1 mg/kg i.m.) did not alter urine output, and a marked diuretic effect was demonstrated 24 h to 2 weeks after clocinnamox administration. Clocinnamox did not alter the discriminative stimulus or diuretic effects of nalbuphine or of the kappa-opioid receptor agonists EKC or U69593. These results are consistent with an in vivo agonist activity of butorphanol at kappa-opioid receptors that can only be demonstrated when an insurmountable antagonist has substantially eliminated the dominant receptor population through which it exerts its action.",

In the present study, the effects of combined treatment with opioids and H1-antagonists on discriminative stimulus effects were examined in rats trained to discriminate between cocaine (10 mg/kg) or morphine (3.0 mg/kg) and saline, since it is believed that discriminative stimulus effects of abused drugs are related to their rewarding effects. Tripelennamine and chlorpheniramine, but not pentazocine or dihydrocodeine, generalized to the discriminative stimulus effects of cocaine. Pentazocine (3.0 mg/kg) and dihydrocodeine (5.6 mg/kg) significantly potentiated the cocaine-like discriminative stimulus effects of low doses of tripelennamine and chlorpheniramine, respectively. On the other hand, pentazocine and dihydrocodeine, but not tripelennamine or chlorpheniramine, generalized to the discriminative stimulus effects of morphine. Neither 1.0 or 3.0 mg/kg tripelennamine nor chlorpheniramine affected the morphine-like discriminative stimulus effects of pentazocine and dihydrocodeine, respectively. These results suggest that the potentiation of the cocaine-like discriminative stimulus effects of H1-antagonists by opioids may be involved in the enhanced rewarding effects of combinations of opioids and H1-antagonists.",

        "abstract": "During more than five decades, pyridinium oximes have been developed as therapeutic agents used in the medical treatment of poisoning with organophosphorus compounds. Their mechanism of action is reactivation of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibited by organophosphorus agents. Organophosphorus compounds (OPC) are used as pesticides and developed as warfare nerve agents such as tabun, soman, sarin, VX and others. Exposure to even small amounts of an OPC can be fatal and death is usually caused by respiratory failure resulting from paralysis of the diaphragm and intercostal muscles, depression of the brain respiratory center, bronchospasm, and excessive bronchial secretions. The mechanism of OPC poisoning involves phosphorylation of the serine hydroxyl group at the active site of AChE leading to the inactivation of this essential enzyme, which has an important role in neurotransmission. AChE inhibition results in the accumulation of acetylcholine at cholinergic receptor sites, producing continuous stimulation of cholinergic fibers throughout the central and peripheral nervous systems. Presently, a combination of an antimuscarinic agent, e.g. atropine, AChE reactivator such as one of the standard pyridinium oximes (pralidoxime, trimedoxime, obidoxime, HI-6) and diazepam has been used for the treatment of organophosphate poisoning in humans. Despite enormous efforts devoted to synthesis and development of new pyridinium oximes as potential antidotes against poisoning with OPC, only four compounds have found their application in human medicine so far. However, they differ in their activity in poisoning with warfare nerve agents and pesticides and there is still no universal broad-spectrum oxime capable of protecting against all known OPC. In this article, we review data on structure-activity relationship of pyridinium oximes and discuss their pharmacological and toxicological significance.",

Pretreatment with either cyproheptadine (a serotonin and histamine antagonist) or methysergide (a serotonin antagonist) prevented the formation of gastric mucosal lesions with attenuation of reduced gastric mucosal blood flow at 0.5 h after compound 48/80 injection, while pretreatment with either amitriptyline (a selective inhibitor of histamine release from mast cells), tripelennamine (a histamine H1-receptor antagonist), famotidine (a histamine H2-receptor antagonist) or cimetidine (a histamine H2-receptor antagonist) had no effect. Pretreatment with either cyproheptadine, methysergide, amitriptyline or tripelennamine prevented the development of gastric mucosal lesions at 3 h after compound 48/80 injection, while pretreatment with either famotidine or cimetidine had no effect. These results indicate that in unanaesthetised rats with a single compound 48/80 treatment, acutely released endogenous serotonin causes gastric mucosal lesions, while released endogenous histamine mainly contributes to the lesion development and that gastric acid plays little role in the pathogenesis of the compound 48/80-induced acute gastric lesions.",

METHODS: The functional role of aquaporin-1 (AQP1) was investigated in tumor tissues by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. The effect of acetazolamide on tumor metastasis was analyzed by Lewis-lung-carcinoma model. Differential protein was identified by SDS-PAGE, isoelectrofocusing (IEF) methods, and peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF). RESULTS: Acetazolamide (40 mg/kg/d po for 21 d) dramatically reduced the numbers of lung metastasis after sc inoculating Lewis lung carcinoma. The inhibition rate of lung metastases was 83.9 %. Simultaneously, the AQP1 protein level and actin-cytoplasmic in lungs containing metastatic tumor deposits were found to be higher than that in the normal tissue. After treated with acetazolamide for 21 d, the expression of AQP1 was obviously inhibited. CONCLUSION: Acetazolamide can suppress tumor metastasis, at least in part, by inhibiting the expression of AQP1. AQP1 and actin-cytoplasmic may be new prognostic molecules as well as new therapeutic targets for the prevention and treatment of metastatic tumor.",

        "abstract": "Drugs that antagonize D2-like receptors are effective antipsychotics, but the debilitating movement disorder side effects associated with these drugs cannot be dissociated from dopamine receptor blockade. The \"atypical\" antipsychotics have a lower propensity to cause extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS), but the molecular basis for this is not fully understood nor is the impact of inverse agonism upon their clinical properties. Using a cell-based functional assay, we demonstrate that overexpression of Galphao induces constitutive activity in the human D2-like receptors (D2, D3, and D4). A large collection of typical and atypical antipsychotics was profiled for activity at these receptors. Virtually all were D2 and D3 inverse agonists, whereas none was D4 inverse agonist, although many were potent D4 antagonists. The inverse agonist activity of haloperidol at D2 and D3 receptors could be reversed by mesoridazine demonstrating that there were significant differences in the degrees of inverse agonism among the compounds tested. Aripiprazole and the principle active metabolite of clozapine NDMC [8-chloro-11-(1-piperazinyl)-5H-dibenzo [b,e] [1,4] diazepine] were identified as partial agonists at D2 and D3 receptors, although clozapine itself was an inverse agonist at these receptors. NDMC-induced functional responses could be reversed by clozapine. It is proposed that the low incidence of EPS associated with clozapine and aripiprazole used may be due, in part, to these partial agonist properties of NDMC and aripiprazole and that bypassing clozapine blockade through direct administration of NDMC to patients may provide superior antipsychotic efficacy.",

        "abstract": "Following the discovery of the weak, competitive and reversible acetylcholinesterase (AChE)-inhibiting activity of minaprine (3c) (IC50 = 85 microM on homogenized rat striatum AChE), a series of 3-amino-6-phenylpyridazines was synthesized and tested for inhibition of AChE. A classical structure-activity relationship exploration suggested that, in comparison to minaprine, the critical elements for high AChE inhibition are as follows: (i) presence of a central pyridazine ring, (ii) necessity of a lipophilic cationic head, (iii) change from a 2- to a 4-5-carbon units distance between the pyridazine ring and the cationic head. Among all the derivatives investigated, 3-[2-(1-benzylpiperidin-4-yl)ethylamino]-6-phenylpyridazine (3y), which shows an IC50 of 0.12 microM on purified AChE (electric eel), was found to be one of the most potent anti-AChE inhibitors, representing a 5000-fold increase in potency compared to minaprine.1",

        "abstract": "Organophosphates inactivate acetylcholinesterase by reacting covalently with the active center serine. We have examined the reactivation of a series of resolved enantiomeric methylphosphonate conjugates of acetylcholinesterase by two oximes, 2-pralidoxime (2-PAM) and 1-(2'-hydroxyiminomethyl-1'-pyridinium)-3-(4'-carbamoyl-1-pyridinium) (HI-6). The S(p) enantiomers of the methylphosphonate esters are far more reactive in forming the conjugate with the enzyme, and we find that rates of oxime reactivation also show an S(p) versus R(p) preference, suggesting that a similar orientation of the phosphonyl oxygen toward the oxyanion hole is required for both efficient inactivation and reactivation. A comparison of reactivation rates of (S(p))- and (R(p))-cycloheptyl, 3,3-dimethylbutyl, and isopropyl methylphosphonyl conjugates shows that steric hindrance by the alkoxy group precludes facile access of the oxime to the tetrahedral phosphorus. To facilitate access, we substituted smaller side chains in the acyl pocket of the active center and find that the Phe295Leu substitution enhances the HI-6-elicited reactivation rates of the S(p) conjugates up to 14-fold, whereas the Phe297Ile substitution preferentially enhances 2-PAM reactivation by as much as 125-fold. The fractional enhancement of reactivation achieved by these mutations of the acyl pocket is greatest for the conjugated phosphonates of the largest steric bulk. By contrast, little enhancement of the reactivation rate is seen with these mutants for the R(p) conjugates, where limitations on oxime access to the phosphonate and suboptimal positioning of the phosphonyl oxygen in the oxyanion hole may both slow reactivation. These findings suggest that impaction of the conjugated organophosphate within the constraints of the active center gorge is a major factor in influencing oxime access and reactivation rates. Moreover, the individual oximes differ in attacking orientation, leading to the presumed pentavalent transition state. Hence, their efficacies as reactivating agents depend on the steric bulk of the intervening groups surrounding the tetrahedral phosphorus.",

Emedastine (0.1%) failed to significantly attenuate either serotonin or platelet-activating-factor induced vascular permeability changes indicating high selectivity for the histamine H1 receptor. In a passive conjunctival anaphylaxis model in guinea pigs, significant inhibition of the allergic response was observed following topical ocular administration of emedastine 5 min or 30 min prior to antigen challenge (ED50s 0.0046% and 0.00022%, respectively).

        "abstract": "Estrogen receptor-alpha (ER) antagonists have been widely used for breast cancer therapy. Despite initial responsiveness, hormone-sensitive ER-positive cancer cells eventually develop resistance to ER antagonists. It has been shown that in most of these resistant tumor cells, the ER is expressed and continues to regulate tumor growth. Recent studies indicate that tamoxifen initially acts as an antagonist, but later functions as an ER agonist, promoting tumor growth. This suggests that targeted ER degradation may provide an effective therapeutic approach for breast cancers, even those that are resistant to conventional therapies. With this in mind, we previously demonstrated that proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs) effectively induce degradation of the ER as a proof-of-concept experiment. Herein we further refined the PROTAC approach to target the ER for degradation. The ER-targeting PROTACs are composed of an estradiol on one end and a hypoxia-inducing factor 1alpha (HIF-1alpha)-derived synthetic pentapeptide on the other. The pentapeptide is recognized by an E3 ubiquitin ligase called the von Hippel Lindau tumor suppressor protein (pVHL), thereby recruiting the ER to this E3 ligase for ubiquitination and degradation. Specifically, the pentapeptide is attached at three different locations on estradiol to generate three different PROTAC types. With the pentapeptide linked through the C7alpha position of estradiol, the resulting PROTAC shows the most effective ER degradation and highest affinity for the estrogen receptor. This result provides an opportunity to develop a novel type of ER antagonist that may overcome the resistance of breast tumors to conventional drugs such as tamoxifen and fulvestrant (Faslodex).",

        "abstract": "Endometriosis is a disorder that affects 5% of the normal population but is present in up to 40% of women with pelvic pain and/or infertility. Recent evidence suggests that the endometrium of women with endometriosis exhibits progesterone insensitivity. One endometrial protein that fluctuates in response to progesterone is the estrogen receptor-alpha (ER alpha), being down-regulated at the time of peak progesterone secretion during the window of implantation. Here we demonstrate that the biomarker of uterine receptivity, beta 3 integrin subunit, is reduced or absent in some women with endometriosis and that such defects are accompanied by inappropriate over-expression of ER alpha during the mid-secretory phase. Using a well-differentiated endometrial cell line we showed that the beta 3 integrin protein is negatively regulated by estrogen and positively regulated by epidermal growth factor (EGF). By competing against estrogen with various selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs) and estrogen receptor agonists and antagonists, inhibition of expression of the beta 3 integrin by estrogen can be mitigated. In conclusion, we hypothesize that certain types of uterine receptivity defects may be caused by the loss of appropriate ER alpha down-regulation in the mid-secretory phase, leading to defects in uterine receptivity. Such changes might be effectively treated by timely administration of the appropriate anti-estrogens to artificially block ER alpha and restore normal patterns of gene expression. Such treatments will require further clinical studies.",

The racemate and the (--)-isomer were found to be potent partial agonists of alpha adrenergic receptors in rat aorta. The (+)-isomer lacked alpha agonist activity. The affinities of (+/-)-, (+)- and (--)-dobutamine for the alpha adrenergic receptor were high (--log KB values of 7.01, 7.02 and 7.07, respectively) and not significantly different from one another. These data indicate that (+)- and (--)- dobutamine bind equally to the alpha adrenergic receptor, however, subsequent to binding, only the (--)-isomer is capable of activating the receptor and eliciting an alpha adrenergic response. The (+)-isomer, which has the same affinity as the (--)-isomer but which lacks agonist activity, is a potent competitive alpha blocker. Both stereoisomers of dobutamine were agonists of beta adrenergic receptors of cat papillary muscle and right atria. In contrast to the alpha adrenergic effects, the more potent isomer at the beta adrenergic receptor was (+)- dobutamine. The isomeric activity ratio for the stereoisomers of dobutamine was approximately 1 log unit in favor of the (+)-isomer with respect to both inotropic and chronotropic responses. Dose-response curves to the racemate were always situated between the stereoisomers, approximately 2-fold to the right of (+)-dobutamine. These results indicate that the stereochemical requirements of alpha and beta adrenergic receptors are opposite for the stereoisomers of dobutamine with the alpha receptor favoring the (--)-isomer and the beta receptor favoring the (+)-isomer.",

Recently a subunit of F0F1-ATP synthase, oligomycin sensitivity-conferring protein, was identified as a new estradiol-binding protein. Estradiol could directly modulate mitochondrial ATP synthase activity through this subunit. In addition, intracellular ATP levels play a role in apoptotic death, which is an energy-dependent process requiring functioning mitochondria. Here we examined the effect of 17 beta-estradiol on F0F1-ATP synthase directly (in permeabilized cells) and in intact osteoclastic FLG 29.1 cells, a model of inducible apoptosis. The baseline F0F1-ATP synthase activity of FLG 29.1 cells was 4.485 nmol/min per mg. Estradiol rapidly inhibited F0F1-ATP synthase activity in the physiological range (half-inhibition concentration, IC50, of 30 nmol/l). With 1 nmol/l of estradiol, the inhibition was already significant (8-10% inhibition, p &lt; 0.01) and with 100 nmol/l residual enzyme activity was only 15% (85% inhibition, p &lt; 0.01). In addition, the effect of estradiol appeared to be directed towards F0F1-ATP synthase, since succinate-sustained respiration, uncoupled from the electron transport chain, was unaffected by estradiol. We assayed F0F1-ATP synthase activity in FLG 29.1 cells during inducible apoptosis. No significant difference of ATP synthesis was detected in apoptotic cells versus controls. In conclusion, we showed a new non-genomic effect of estradiol on a key mitochondrial enzyme, which thereby directly modulates cellular energy metabolism.",

Studies on pemetrexed have concluded that not only is the compound a TS inhibitor but also a potent inhibitor of human dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). The results suggest that pemetrexed acts upon multiple intracellular targets and that the antitumor effect may be derived from its simultaneous inhibition of multiple folate-requiring enzymes [203662]: this compound has been designated as a multitargeted antifolate (MTA) [386680]. The drug also causes concentration- and time-dependent apoptosis [284380]. Other studies in which the 4-oxo group of the pyrimidine ring portion of pemetrexed was replaced with a hydrogen atom, demonstrated that the resulting analogs were potent DHFR inhibitors with very little activity against the enzymes glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GARFT) and TS [310674]. In phase II European studies in 64 patients with advanced breast cancer, encouraging responses were seen in anthracycline-failure (23%) and anthracycline-refractory (19%) patients. Responses were observed in 28% of patients who had been previously treated with a taxane [326097]. Data from a phase II trial of pemetrexed (500 mg/m2 once every 21 days as a 10 min i.v. infusion) as a salvage therapy in advanced breast cancer showed that supplementation of the treatment regime with folic acid (FA) and vitamin B12 reduced its already manageable and tolerable toxicities [408821], [409650]. At doses of 500 mg/m2, the drug was also safely administered to 35 patients with impaired renal function [409953]. Phase I and II trials have shown that the main side effects include neutropenia, thrombocytopenia, mucositis, nausea and vomiting [203666], [272241].

Inhibition as a function of subphase concentration of anesthetic was in the order: dibucaine greater than tetracaine greater than butacaine greater than lidocaine = procaine. Inhibition as a function of surface concentration showed no obvious correlation; procaine inhibited at a very low surface concentration, followed by lidocaine at a somewhat higher concentration, and tetracaine, butacaine and dibucaine only at rather high concentrations. Ultraviolet difference spectroscopy indicated an interaction between lidocaine and enzyme in the subphase. Fluorescence studies showed that lidocaine is a competitive inhibitor of enzyme-lipid interface interaction. It is proposed that the more surface-active anesthetics inhibit by surface effects while the less surface-active anesthetics (lidocaine and procaine) inhibit by interaction with the enzyme in the subphase, which prevents enzyme penetration at the monolayer interface.",

SAMPLE POPULATION: Blood samples from 30 healthy horses, 48 healthy dogs, and 9 healthy cats. PROCEDURE: Activities of COX-1 and COX-2 were determined by measuring coagulation-induced thromboxane and lipopolysaccharide-induced prostaglandin E2 concentrations, respectively, in whole blood with and without the addition of various concentrations of phenylbutazone, flunixin meglumine, ketoprofen, diclofenac, indomethacin, meloxicam, carprofen, 5-bromo-2[4-fluorophenyl]-3-14-methylsulfonylphenyl]-thiophene (DuP 697), 5,5-dimethyl-3-(3-fluorophenyl)-4-(4-methylsulphonyl) phenyl-2(5H)-furan one (DFU), 3-(3,4-difluorophenyl)-4-(4-(methylsulfonyl)phenyl)-2-(5H)-furanone (MF-tricyclic), and celecoxib. Potency of each test compound was determined by calculating the concentration that resulted in inhibition of 50% of COX activity (IC50). Selectivity was determined by calculating the ratio of IC50 for COX-1 to IC50 for COX-2 (COX-1/COX-2 ratio). RESULTS: The novel compound DFU was the most selective COX-2 inhibitor in equine, canine, and feline blood; COX-1/COX-2 ratios were 775, 74, and 69, respectively. Carprofen was the weakest inhibitor of COX-2, compared with the other COX-2 selective inhibitors, and did not inhibit COX-2 activity in equine blood. In contrast, NSAID such as phenylbutazone and flunixin meglumine were more potent inhibitors of COX-1 than COX-2 in canine and equine blood. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The novel COX-2 inhibitor DFU was more potent and selective in canine, equine, and feline blood, compared with phenylbutazone, flunixin meglumine, and carprofen. Compounds that specifically inhibit COX-2 may result in a lower incidence of adverse effects, compared with NSAID, when administered at therapeutic dosages to horses, dogs, and cats.",

        "abstract": "Previous studies by this research team proved that vasodilating prostaglandins (PGs) E1, E2 and I2 inhibit carbonic anhydrase (CA) in vitro and in vivo, which suggested involvement of CA in gastric acid secretion inhibition and the increase of gastric mucosa blood flow produced by this group of PGs. Relying on these findings, as well as on our clinical observations, we studied in vitro and in vivo the effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) on CA I and CA II. We also followed in vitro the effects on these isozymes of NSAIDs associated to histamine, Ca, PGE2 and acetazolamide. The results show that the NSAIDs used here, which reduce the activity of cyclooxygenase and PG production, activated CA I and CA II in a dose-dependent manner by a mechanism of the noncompetitive type. Histamine and Ca added to NSAIDs amplified the activating effect of the latter on CA II. Association of PGE2 or acetazolamide to NSAIDs reduced NSAID-induced activation of CA I and CA II. Indomethacin abolished the inhibitory effect of acetazolamide on CA I and CA II. Our data imply that between CA and cyclooxygenase there is an inverse relationship, CA activation being accompanied by reduction of cyclooxygenase activity, a reduction achieved by the pH modifications induced by CA activation. In this way, cyclooxygenase, inhibition occurs \"via CA,\" with the pH variations it brings about.",

        "abstract": "The dopamine D4 receptor, which is considered a close variant of the dopamine D2 receptor, has recently been cloned. Receptor binding studies demonstrated that clozapine, which is an effective antipsychotic agent but atypical in that it lacks the usual side effects of other antipsychotic agents, has high selectivity for the dopamine D4 receptor versus the dopamine D2 receptor. Comparative binding affinity studies have been carried out for a number of interesting dopaminergic agents using membranes prepared from cloned dopamine D2 and D4 receptor containing cells. It was found that clozapine is selective for the dopamine D4 vs. the D2 receptor by a factor of 2.8. Other compounds with dopamine D4 receptor selectivity were (+)-apomorphine (8.7), (+)-N-propyl-norapomorphine (NPA) (2.4) and melperone (1.3). Compounds with considerable selectivity for the dopamine D2 receptor were haloperidol (0.31), chlorpromazine (0.084), trifluoperazine (0.034) and raclopride (0.001). Overall, the results with the antipsychotic agents tested, support the concept that dopamine D4 receptor selectivity may confer clozapine-like antipsychotic efficacy and furthermore that dopamine D2 receptor selectivity may confer side effect liability (extrapyramidal side effects and tardive dyskinesia).",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To establish an in vitro assay and determine the differential suppressive activity of non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) on cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and COX-2 isoenzymes in dogs. PROCEDURE: COX activity was evaluated in the presence and absence of 4 NSAID (meloxicam, tolfenamic acid, carprofen, and ketoprofen), using a canine monocyte/macrophage cell line that constitutively expresses COX-1, but can be induced to express COX-2 when incubated with lipopolysaccharide. Inhibition of prostaglandin E2 TPGE2) synthesis by each NSAID was measured by enzyme immunoassay and attributed to specific COX-1 or COX-2 activity through assessment of COX messenger RNA expression by use of northern blot analysis and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The COX selectivity of each drug was evaluated from dose-response curves by calculating a ratio (COX-1:COX-2) of inhibitory concentration values on the basis of concentrations that reduced PGE2 by 50% in each COX model. RESULTS: Meloxicam and tolfenamic acid preferentially inhibited COX-2, with meloxicam inhibiting COX-2 activity 12 times more effectively than COX-1 activity. Carprofen was only 1.75 times more selective for COX-2 than for COX-1, and ketoprofen was slightly more selective for COX-1. CONCLUSIONS: COX-1 and COX-2 were differentially sensitive to inhibition in vitro by NSAID. Meloxicam and tolfenamic acid were selective for COX-2. Effects of carprofen and ketoprofen approached equipotency against both isoenzymes. Selective COX-2 inhibitors are a new class of drugs with anti-inflammatory effects similar to conventional NSAID but with fewer adverse effects. Development of these agents for veterinary use would be facilitated by the convenience of using a canine cell line as a model system to screen COX-1 and COX-2 inhibitor activities in vitro.",

        "title": "The muscarinic receptor antagonist tropicamide suppresses tremulous jaw movements in a rodent model of parkinsonian tremor: possible role of M4 receptors.",
        "abstract": "RATIONALE: Nonselective muscarinic acetylcholine antagonists have been used for several years as antiparkinsonian drugs. However, there are at least five subtypes of muscarinic receptor (M1-5). Neostriatal M4 receptors have been implicated in aspects of motor function, and it has been suggested that M4 antagonists could be used as treatments for parkinsonism. OBJECTIVE: Currently, there is a lack of highly selective M4 antagonists that readily penetrate the blood brain barrier. Thus, the present studies focused upon the effects of tropicamide, a muscarinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist with moderate binding selectivity for the M4 receptor subtype. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Tremulous jaw movements were used as a model of parkinsonian tremor in these studies, and the effects of tropicamide were compared with those of the nonselective muscarinic antagonist atropine. RESULTS: Tropicamide suppressed the tremulous jaw movements induced by the muscarinic agonist pilocarpine and the dopamine antagonist pimozide. Analysis of the dose-response curves indicated that tropicamide showed approximately the same potency as atropine for suppression of pilocarpine-induced jaw movements but was more potent than atropine on the suppression of pimozide-induced jaw movements. In contrast, atropine was more potent than tropicamide in terms of impairing performance on visual stimulus detection and delayed nonmatch-to-position tasks. CONCLUSIONS: These studies demonstrate that tropicamide, which currently is used clinically for ophthalmic purposes, can exert actions that are consistent with antiparkinsonian effects. Moreover, the different pattern of effects shown by tropicamide compared to those of atropine on motor vs cognitive tasks could be due to the modest M4 selectivity shown by tropicamide.",

        "abstract": "Pseudoephedrine (PSE) is a stereoisomer of ephedrine that is commonly used as a nasal decongestant in combination with other anti-inflammatory drugs for the symptomatic treatment of some common pathologies such as common cold. Herein, we describe for the first time the effects of PSE on T-cell activation events. We found that PSE inhibits interleukin-2 (IL-2) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha-gene transcription in stimulated Jurkat cells, a human T-cell leukemia cell line. To further characterize the inhibitory mechanisms of PSE at the transcriptional level, we examined the transcriptional activities of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB), nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT), and activator protein-1 (AP-1) transcription factors and found that PSE inhibited NF-kappaB-dependent transcriptional activity without affecting either the phosphorylation, the degradation of the cytoplasmic NF-kappaB inhibitory protein, IkappaBalpha or the DNA-binding activity. However, phosphorylation of the p65/RelA subunit was clearly inhibited by PSE in stimulated cells. In addition, PSE inhibited the transcriptional activity of NFAT without interfering with the calcium-induced NFAT dephosphorylation event, which represents the major signaling pathway for its activation. NFAT cooperates with c-Jun, a compound of the AP-1 complex, to activate target genes, and we also found that PSE inhibited both JNK activation and AP-1 transcriptional activity. These findings provide new mechanistic insights into the potential immunomodulatory activities of PSE and highlight their potential in designing novel therapeutic strategies to manage inflammatory diseases.",

We describe here similar opiate actions in humans. Increasing doses of the potent mu opioid receptor agonist fentanyl (FE), 0.1, 0.2, and 0.25 mg/70 kg body weight (bw), induced a significant, dose-dependent increase of noradrenaline (NA) and adrenaline (A) plasma concentrations in healthy male individuals. Whereas NA increased continuously with increasing FE dose, a maximum A response was already reached at the lowest dose. These dose-related NA and A response patterns, showing a higher A sensitivity to opiate receptor stimulation, corresponded closely to those reported from animal studies. Furthermore, comparing the CA releasing potency of 0.2 mg FE/70 kg bw to analgetically equipotent doses of the less selective mu opioid receptor agonist morphine and the kappa agonist/mu antagonist nalbuphine in different groups of male individuals, we found similar effects of these opiates on CA plasma concentrations. These data suggest that the opiate-induced CA release in humans is not only mediated by mu opioid receptors, but may also involve kappa opioid receptor subtypes.",

In the present study, we investigated the pro-apoptotic activities of donepezil in HL-60 human promyelocytic leukemia cells and the underlying molecular mechanism involved. It was found that donepezil induced the apoptosis of HL-60 and U937 cells in a dose- and time-dependent manner, as evidenced by the formation of DNA fragmentation and the accumulation of positive cells for Annexin V. In addition, the activations of caspase-8, -9, and -3 were significantly increased 36 h after donepezil treatment. Furthermore, the broad caspase inhibitor (z-VAD-fmk) blocked donepezil-induced apoptosis. In addition, donepezil was found to cause the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsi(m)), to increase the release of cytochrome c to the cytosol, and to alter the expressions of Bcl-2 family proteins. Taken together, these results demonstrate for the first time that donepezil displayed an induction of apoptosis in HL-60 cells via a mitochondria-mediated caspase-dependent pathway.",

        "title": "Human physiologically based pharmacokinetic model for ACE inhibitors: ramipril and ramiprilat.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors have complicated and poorly characterized pharmacokinetics. There are two binding sites per ACE (high affinity \"C\", lower affinity \"N\") that have sub-nanomolar affinities and dissociation rates of hours. Most inhibitors are given orally in a prodrug form that is systemically converted to the active form. This paper describes the first human physiologically based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model of this drug class. METHODS: The model was applied to the experimental data of van Griensven et. al for the pharmacokinetics of ramiprilat and its prodrug ramipril. It describes the time course of the inhibition of the N and C ACE sites in plasma and the different tissues. The model includes: 1) two independent ACE binding sites; 2) non-equilibrium time dependent binding; 3) liver and kidney ramipril intracellular uptake, conversion to ramiprilat and extrusion from the cell; 4) intestinal ramipril absorption. The experimental in vitro ramiprilat/ACE binding kinetics at 4 degrees C and 300 mM NaCl were assumed for most of the PBPK calculations. The model was incorporated into the freely distributed PBPK program PKQuest. RESULTS: The PBPK model provides an accurate description of the individual variation of the plasma ramipril and ramiprilat and the ramiprilat renal clearance following IV ramiprilat and IV and oral ramipril. Summary of model features: Less than 2% of total body ACE is in plasma; 35% of the oral dose is absorbed; 75% of the ramipril metabolism is hepatic and 25% of this is converted to systemic ramiprilat; 100% of renal ramipril metabolism is converted to systemic ramiprilat. The inhibition was long lasting, with 80% of the C site and 33% of the N site inhibited 24 hours following a 2.5 mg oral ramipril dose. The plasma ACE inhibition determined by the standard assay is significantly less than the true in vivo inhibition because of assay dilution. CONCLUSION: If the in vitro plasma binding kinetics of the ACE inhibitor for the two binding sites are known, a unique PBPK model description of the Griensven et. al. experimental data can be obtained.",

        "abstract": "Bronchial epithelial cells play an important role in amplifying and perpetuating airway inflammation and may be a target for inhaled steroids. We have characterized glucocorticoid receptors in primary human bronchial epithelial cells. Northern and western blot analyses demonstrated the expression of glucocorticoid receptor mRNA and protein, respectively, in primary bronchial epithelial cells. The activity of these receptors was shown using a radioligand binding assay. High-affinity binding with pharmacological specificity was demonstrated for [3H]dexamethasone. The equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) and density of binding sites (Bmax) for [3H]dexamethasone determined from saturation isotherms were 4.4 nM x/divided by 0.95 (SEM) and 30.1 fmol/mg protein +/-6.4 (SEM). Glucocorticoid receptors were activated by dexamethasone as assessed using a glucocorticoid-responsive reporter plasmid, pTAT3-CAT. Transfection of primary human bronchial epithelial cells with this reporter plasmid resulted in 35-fold activation of transcription following dexamethasone stimulation (10(-6) M). The glucocorticoid receptor antagonist RU-486 (mifepristone) significantly counteracted the effect of dexamethasone on glucocorticoid receptor activation, indicating that the dexamethasone effect is specific and is mediated through the glucocorticoid receptor. In summary, our study demonstrated that primary cultures of human bronchial epithelial cells possess glucocorticoid receptors that function as a ligand-activated transcriptional regulator. The presence of glucocorticoid receptors confers their responsiveness to glucocorticoids and indicates that the airway epithelium may be a target for the anti-inflammatory effects of inhaled steroids.",

        "abstract": "The term neuroenhancement refers to improvement in the cognitive, emotional and motivational functions of healthy individuals through, inter alia, the use of drugs. Of known interventions, psychopharmacology provides readily available options, such as the anti-dementia drugs, e.g. acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, galantamine, rivastigmine) and memantine. Based on a systematic review we found that expectations about the potential of these drugs exceed their actual effects, as has been demonstrated in randomised controlled trials. Both single and repeated dose trials were included in the systematic review, however repeated dose trials have only been conducted for donepezil. In six small trials lasting 14-42 days, the following results emerged: donepezil improved the retention of training on complex aviation tasks and verbal memory for semantically processed words. In one study episodic memory was improved, whereas in others it remained unaffected by donepezil. In a sleep deprivation trial, donepezil reduced the memory and attention deficits resulting from 24h of sleep deprivation. Two studies reported even transient negative effects. Regarding the safety profile of donepezil, these studies found that it was rather well tolerated. In any case, since large longitudinal studies are not available no conclusions can be drawn. Seven small studies about the effects of a single dose of memantine, and one study with a single dose of rivastigmine have been reported. Again, these studies are not adequate to answer our research question. If, as here and elsewhere suggested, the concept of pharmaceutical neuroenhancement is not to be rejected in principle, the decision of healthy individuals to take drugs for the purpose of neuroenhancement should be based on exhaustive information. At the moment, the research that would support or oppose the use of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors and memantine for neuroenhancement by healthy individuals has not yet been performed.",

Although administration of LY235959 alone generally does not produce antinociception, LY235959 potentiates the antinociceptive effects of morphine in squirrel monkeys. The present study was designed to determine whether LY235959 would potentiate the acute antinociceptive effects of morphine as well those of the opioid receptor agonists l-methadone, levorphanol, butorphanol, and buprenorphine. A squirrel monkey titration procedure was used in which shock (delivered to the tail) increased in intensity every 15 s (0.01-2.0 mA) in 30 increments. Five lever presses during any given 15-s shock period (fixed ratio 5) produced a 15-s shock-free period after which shock resumed at the next lower intensity. Morphine (0.3-3.0 mg/kg i.m.), l-methadone (0.1-0.56 mg/kg i.m.), levorphanol (0.1-1.0 mg/kg i.m.), butorphanol (1.0-10 mg/kg i.m.), and buprenorphine (0.01-0.03 mg/kg i.m.), but not LY235959 (0.1-1.0 mg/kg i.m.), dose and time dependently increased the intensity below which monkeys maintained shock 50% of the time (median shock level, MSL). LY235959 dose dependently potentiated the effect of each opioid agonist on MSL when concurrently administered to monkeys. Although LY235959 potentiated the antinociceptive effect of each opioid examined in a statistically significant manner, LY235959 seemed more potent and effective when combined with higher efficacy opioids. The present data suggest that the N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist, LY235959, can potentiate the antinociceptive effects of a range of opioid receptor agonists independently of nonspecific motor effects.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study was to examine the influence of the topical carbonic anhydrase-II-inhibitor dorzolamide hydrochloride (Trusopt) in regarding to behaviour of intraocular eyepressure after Nd:YAG-laser-capsulotomy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study was carried out as a double-blind-test. In a period of nine months, 120 patients underwent Nd:YAG-laser-capsulotomy. One group was given dorzolamide hydrochloride (Trusopt), the other group (placebo) remained without medication. The intraocular pressure was measured before capsulotomy and four hours post-op. For statistical evaluation the t-test of not-associated spot-checks was performed. RESULTS: The prophylactic use of the topical carbonic anhydrase-II-inhibitor dorzolamide hydrochloride (Trusopt) after nd:YAG-laser-capsulotomy shows a highly significant lowering of intraocular pressure, i.e. 1.09 mm Hg in the average. CONCLUSIONS: It was demonstrated that a single dose of dorzolamide hydrochloride (Trusopt) after Nd:YAG-laser-capsulotomy could lower intraocular pressure significantly. Prophylactical usage of dorzolamide hydrochloride (Trusopt) is a useful method to prevent the increase of intraocular pressure and thus to protect the eye against hazardous damage.",

        "title": "Betaxolol, a selective beta(1)-adrenergic receptor antagonist, diminishes anxiety-like behavior during early withdrawal from chronic cocaine administration in rats.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Anxiety has been indicated as one of the main symptoms of the cocaine withdrawal syndrome in human addicts and severe anxiety during withdrawal may potentially contribute to relapse. As alterations in noradrenergic transmission in limbic areas underlie withdrawal symptomatology for many drugs of abuse, the present study sought to determine the effect of cocaine withdrawal on beta-adrenergic receptor (beta(1) and beta(2)) expression in the amygdala. METHODS: Male Sprague Dawley rats were administered intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of cocaine (20 mg/kg) once daily for 14 days. Two days following the last cocaine injection, amygdala brain regions were micro-dissected and processed for Western blot analysis. Results showed that beta(1)-adrenergic receptor, but not beta(2)-adrenergic receptor expression was significantly increased in amygdala extracts of cocaine-withdrawn animals as compared to controls. This finding motivated further studies aimed at determining whether treatment with betaxolol, a highly selective beta(1)-adrenergic receptor antagonist, could ameliorate cocaine withdrawal-induced anxiety. In these studies, betaxolol (5 mg/kg via i.p. injection) was administered at 24 and then 44 h following the final chronic cocaine administration. Anxiety-like behavior was evaluated using the elevated plus maze test approximately 2 h following the last betaxolol injection. Following behavioral testing, betaxolol effects on beta(1)-adrenergic receptor protein expression were examined by Western blotting in amygdala extracts from rats undergoing cocaine withdrawal. RESULTS: Animals treated with betaxolol during cocaine withdrawal exhibited a significant attenuation of anxiety-like behavior characterized by increased time spent in the open arms and increased entries into the open arms compared to animals treated with only saline during cocaine withdrawal. In contrast, betaxolol did not produce anxiolytic-like effects in control animals treated chronically with saline. Furthermore, treatment with betaxolol during early cocaine withdrawal significantly decreased beta(1)-adrenergic receptor protein expression in the amygdala to levels comparable to those of control animals. CONCLUSIONS: The present findings suggest that the anxiolytic-like effect of betaxolol on cocaine-induced anxiety may be related to its effect on amygdalar beta(1)-adrenergic receptors that are up-regulated during early phases of drug withdrawal. These data support the efficacy of betaxolol as a potential effective pharmacotherapy in treating cocaine withdrawal-induced anxiety during early phases of abstinence.",

We also compared the inhibition of brain AChE and the brain concentrations of these drugs. Donepezil at 2.5 mg/kg and tacrine at 5 mg/kg showed significant effects for more than 6 h. At these doses, the maximum increases were observed at about 1.5 h after administration of donepezil, and at about 2 h with tacrine, and were 499% and 422% of the pre-level, respectively. ENA-713 produced significant effects at doses of 0.625, 1.25 and 2.5 mg/kg, which lasted for about 1, 2 and 4 h, respectively. The maximum increases produced by these doses at about 0.5 h after administration were 190, 346 and 458% of the pre-level, respectively. The time courses of brain AChE inhibition with donepezil at 2.5 mg/kg, tacrine at 10 mg/kg and ENA-713 at 2.5 mg/kg were mirror images of the extracellular acetylcholine-increasing action at the same doses. The time courses of the brain concentrations of drugs after oral administration of donepezil at 2.5 mg/kg and tacrine at 10 mg/kg were consistent with those of brain AChE inhibition at the same doses, and there was a linear relation between these parameters. Brain concentration of ENA-713 at 2.5 mg/kg was below the limit of quantification at all time points measured. These results suggest that oral administration of donepezil, tacrine and ENA-713 increases acetylcholine concentration in the synaptic cleft of the hippocampus mostly through AChE inhibition, and that donepezil has a more potent activity than tacrine and a longer-lasting effect than ENA-713 on the central cholinergic system.",

        "abstract": "Metoclopramide (MCP) is a dopamine receptor antagonist and serotonin receptor agonist widely used as an antiemetic and gastric prokinetic drug. In addition MCP is a weak and reversible inhibitor of cholinesterases. We have shown that MCP has a cholinesterase protective effect against inhibition by organophosphates. The putative mode of protective action of MCP is competition for the active site of the enzyme with the more potent organophosphate. In the present paper we present our results using another weak inhibitor of cholinesterases: ranitidine (RAN). The purpose of the study was to quantify in vitro the extent of RAN-conferred protection, using paraoxon (POX) as an inhibitor. Paraoxon is a non-neuropathic organophosphate responsible for a large number of accidental or suicidal exposures. Red blood cell (RBC) acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activities in whole blood and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE) activities in human plasma were measured photometrically in the presence of different POX and RAN concentrations and the IC50 was calculated. Determinations were repeated in the presence of increasing RAN concentrations. The IC50 shift induced by the presence of RAN increases with the RAN concentration in a linear manner. The shift was more pronounced with RBC-AChE. The protective effect of RAN on cholinesterase could be of practical relevance in the treatment of POX poisoning. We conclude that in vivo testing of RAN as an organophosphate protective agent is warranted.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of steroidal and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAID) on cyclooxygenase (COX-1 and COX-2) activity in human articular chondrocytes. METHODS: Chondrocytes were isolated from articular cartilage of donors with no articular disease. Unstimulated and interleukin 1 (IL-1) stimulated chondrocytes were used as models to study the effects of drugs on COX-1 and COX-2. Cells were incubated with vehicle or drugs; supernatants were removed and the level of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) in each sample was determined by enzyme immunoassay. IC50 were calculated from the reduction in PGE2 content by different concentrations of the test substance by linear regression analysis. RESULTS: COX- mRNA was detected in unstimulated cells, but stimulation with IL-1 for up 12 h did not modify the levels of COX-1 mRNA. In contrast, COX-2 mRNA was not detectable in unstimulated cells, but it was induced by IL-1. Dexamethasone inhibited COX-2 mRNA expression induced by IL-1. COX-2 protein levels correlated with mRNA expression. Dexamethasone was the strongest drug inhibitor of COX-2 (IC50 = 0.0073 microM). However, it did not inhibit COX-1 activity. Among all NSAID tested, meloxicam and aspirin were the least potent inhibitors of COX-1 (IC50 = 36.6 microM and 3.57 microM, respectively). Indomethacin and diclofenac were the most potent inhibitors of COX-1 (IC50 = 0.063 microM and 0.611 microM, respectively) and COX-2 isoforms (IC50 = 0.48 microM and IC50 = 0.63 microM, respectively). Meloxicam was a more potent inhibitor of COX-2 (IC50 = 4.7 microM) than aspirin (IC50 = 29.3 microM) and similar to piroxicam (IC50 = 4.4 microM). Among all drugs tested dexamethasone showed the greatest selectivity for COX-2 and meloxicam was the NSAID with the best COX-2/COX-1 ratio (r = 0.12). Aspirin and piroxicam were about 8 times more active against COX-1 than COX-2, indomethacin was 7 times more active, and diclofenac was an equipotent inhibitor of COX-1 and COX-2. CONCLUSION: We found that COX-1 and COX-2 isoforms are expressed in human chondrocytes at rest and in IL-1 stimulated cells, respectively. Antiinflammatory drugs have different capacities to inhibit COX enzyme in human articular chondrocytes.",

        "abstract": "Treatment with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) for 72 h was shown to dose-dependently increase nitric oxide production from 6-day-old retinal cultures. Cell death, as determined by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) release and an increase in neuronal labelling for TUNEL, was elevated concurrently. During treatment there was an increase of both inducible nitric oxide synthase and glial fibrillary acidic protein labelling in glial cells and a reduction in the number of gamma-aminobutyric acid-positive neurones. The NOS inhibitors, N-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester, dexamethasone and indomethacin potently inhibited both nitric oxide stimulation and cell death caused by LPS. In this study, the beta(2)- (ICI-18551), beta(1)- (betaxolol) and mixed beta(1)/beta(2)- (timolol, metipranolol) adrenergic receptor antagonists were all shown to attenuate LPS-induced LDH release from these cultures, but to have no effect on LPS-stimulated nitric oxide production. This effect was mimicked by the calcium channel blocker, nifedipine. Interestingly, the beta-adrenergic receptor agonists, salbutamol, arterenol and isoproterenol were also able to attenuate cell death caused by LPS. Moreover, these compounds also inhibited LPS-stimulated nitric oxide release. These studies suggest that LPS stimulates nitric oxide release from cultured retinal glial cells and that this process leads to neurone death. beta-adrenergic receptor agonists prevent the effects of LPS by inhibiting the stimulation of nitric oxide production. The data also suggest that beta-adrenergic receptor antagonists can attenuate LPS-induced death of neurones, but that these compounds act in a manner that is neurone-dependent, is mimicked by blockade of calcium channels and is independent of the stimulation of nitric oxide release.",

To confirm that the seizures were due to histamine H1 receptors blockade, d-chlorpheniramine was administered with monitoring electroencephalography (EEG). Administration of d-chlorpheniramine significantly increased the number of epileptic discharges in the patient, compared with those before administration. Plasma noradrenaline and dopamine levels were not affected by treatment with d-chlorpheniramine. These findings indicate that histamine H1 receptors blockade produced convulsions and increased epileptic discharges on EEG. Recently, several experimental reports have shown that histamine has an inhibitory role on convulsions through histamine H1 receptors. Experimental findings and present results show that histamine H1 antagonists have proconvulsant effects, especially in the developmental period. Thus, it is recommended that centrally-acting histamine H1 antagonists should be avoided in epileptic patients, especially in children of pre-school age.",

        "abstract": "Our earlier observation that the antipsychotic drug haloperidol in the absence of dopamine increases cAMP formation and prolactin release in two prolactin-producing cell lines expressing rat dopamine D2 receptors (GH3, GH4ZR7), but not in similar cells devoid of D2 receptors (GH4C1), prompted us to suggest that haloperidol may act as an inverse (or negative) agonist, rather than as a neutral antagonist, at the D2 receptor (Nilsson and Eriksson 1993). In the present study it is shown that haloperidol elicits a dose-dependent increase in prolactin release also in prolactin-producing GH4C1 cells transfected with the human dopamine D2 receptor (short isoform) (GH4C1-hD2s); in addition, it is shown that another antipsychotic drug, flupenthixol, also causes prolactin release per se in this cell line. The effect of haloperidol on prolactin release in GH4C1-hD2s is calcium dependent and counteracted by pretreatment either with the D2 receptor agonist R(-)-n-propylnorapomorphine or with a D2 receptor antagonist that does not affect prolactin release per se (raclopride). In addition, pretreatment with the alkylating compound phenoxybenzamine at a concentration causing a marked reduction of D2 receptor density in GH4C1-hD2s cells significantly counteracted haloperidol-induced prolactin release.",

        "abstract": "Glucocorticoids have significant effects on endothelium mediated vascular function throughout life. The baboon model has been used extensively to study cellular responses to glucocorticoids at several stages of the lifespan. Endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) is a major regulator of endothelium dependent arterial vasodilation. We have previously demonstrated that synthetic glucocorticoids down regulate eNOS in the baboon placenta. We have now conducted studies to determine whether glucocorticoids would alter eNOS expression in adult systemic vascular endothelial cells in this important animal model. We explored this potential mechanism in endothelial cells from femoral arteries of adult baboons at necropsy and cultured to the fourth passage. Endothelial cells were treated with 10-100nM betamethasone for 24h at 37 degrees C. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) was used as a positive control and medium as negative controls. The role of glucocorticoid receptor mediation in betamethasone-induced eNOS changes was investigated with the glucocorticoid receptor antagonist mifepristone. RNA (real-time quantitative RT-PCR) and protein (ELISA) were extracted and measured for eNOS. Expression and subcellular distribution of glucocorticoid receptor were detected with fluorescence labeled antibody microscopy. eNOS mRNA and protein in baboon endothelial cells were downregulated 25% by betamethasone treatment. This effect was attenuated by pre-incubation with mifepristone (P &lt; 0.01). VEGF upregulated eNOS transcription and translation (P &lt; 0.001), medium did not alter eNOS expression. We observed that mifepristone and VEGF increased glucocorticoid receptor cytoplasmic accumulation by fluorescence microscopy.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Despite the availability of a growing number of potent antiretroviral agents, efforts to completely suppress viral replication in patients with HIV-1 infection are limited because of the increasing risk of resistance. Tipranavir (TPV) is the first in a class of antiretroviral agents known as nonpeptidic protease inhibitors (PIs). TPV exhibits a resistance profile distinct from that of other currently available PIs, making it a potential option for treatment experienced patients with resistance to multiple Pls. OBJECTIVE: This article discusses the clinical pharmacology and efficacy of TPV in the treatment of HIV-1 infection in patients who are highly treatment experienced or harbor PI-resistant virus. METHODS: A search was conducted of English language, peer-reviewed articles and abstracts indexed on the MEDLINE and Current Contents databases (1966-May 2007) using the terms tipranavir, Aptivus, nonpeptidic protease inhibitor, human immunodeficiency virus, and protease resistance. Product information and abstracts from national and international AIDS and retrovirus meetings (2005-2006) were also reviewed. RESULTS: Use of TPV in combination with ritonavir (TPV/r) was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration based on 2 Phase III studies. In these studies, HIV-infected patients with extensive treatment experience with antiretroviral agents, including PIs, nucleoside analogues, and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors, were randomized to receive TPV/r or a ritonavir-boosted comparator PI. All patients had evidence of resistance to multiple PIs. The specific comparator (amprenavir, indinavir, lopinavir, or saquinavir) was selected for each patient with the aid of resistance testing. Each patient also received an optimized background regimen of antiretroviral agents, which could include enfuvirtide. At 24, 48, and 96 weeks, the TPV/r group had higher rates of virologic response (defined as &gt; or =1 log10 decrease in HIV RNA) and viral suppression (to &lt;400 and &lt;50 copies/mL) than did the comparator group. CONCLUSIONS: Although TPV has a mechanism of action similar to that of earlier-generation PIs, it has activity against HIV-1 strains with resistance to multiple PIs. Currently, TPV/r is indicated for use in highly treatment experienced patients with multiple PI resistance.",

        "abstract": "1 In rats anaesthetized with pentobarbitone, intravenous administration of desipramine (0.1 mg/kg), maprotiline (0.5 mg/kg) or mianserin (0.3-3.0 mg/kg) did not modify the blood pressure lowering effects of acetylcholine (0.25-1.0 micrograms/kg, i.v.) which were significantly reduced by atropine (3.0 micrograms/kg, i.v.). 2 Maprotiline and mianserin, like promethazine (0.1 mg/kg, i.v.), inhibited the vasodepressor responses evoked by histamine (2.5-10.0 micrograms/kg,i.v.). however, desipramine was inactive against histamine. 3 In pithed rats, the pressor effects of intravenous 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT: 5.0-20.0 micrograms/kg) were antagonized by mianserin (0.01-0.3 mg/kg, i.v.) and cyproheptadine (0.01 mg/kg) but were unaffected by maprotiline and desipramine. 4 In syrosingopine pretreated rats given mianserin 0.1 mg/kg, intravenously, 5-HT (20.0 micrograms/kg, i.v.) produced a significant fall in blood pressure which could be reduced by a large dose of mianserin (10.0 mg/kg, i.v.). 5 In conclusion, desipramine, maptrotiline and mianserin, in doses previously found to inhibit noradrenaline neuronal reuptake in the rat cardiovascular system, lack muscarinic receptor antagonist properties.

Whilst maprotiline and mianserin blocked vascular histamine receptors, only mianserin, like cyproheptadine, was a potent antagonist of the 5-HT receptors that mediate increases in blood pressure in rats. Finally, the vasodepressor effects of 5-HT in syrosingopine pretreated rats given a small dose of mianserin were antagonized by a large dose of mianserin, suggesting that 5-HT may activate two distinct types of receptors in the rat.",

        "abstract": "1. The effects of six local anaesthetics have been studied on the activities of soluble phospholipases A2 (EC 3.1.1.4) and lysophospholipase (EC 3.1.1.5). 2. Phospholipase A2 activity in human seminal plasma towards sonicated radioactively-labelled phosphatidylethanolamine was slightly stimulated a low and inhibited at high concentrations of all anaesthetic compounds employed. The order of decreasing potency was chlorpromazine, dibucaine, tetracaine, lidocaine, cocaine and procaine. In line with previous findings, the mode of inhibition was seen to be competitive with respect to Ca2+. 3. Phospholipase A2 activity in crude venom of Crotalus adamanteus was not affected or slightly stimulated by local anaesthetics up to 10(-2) M concentrations, when egg yolk was used as substrate. However, with sonicated radioactively-labelled phosphatidylcholine or phosphatidylethanolamine as substrate, stimulation of phospholipase activity was seen with all local anaesthetics up to 10(-2) M, the order of decreasing potency again being chlorpromazine, dibucaine, tetracaine, lidocaine, cocaine and procaine. The mode of stimulation was seen to be un-competitive with respect to substrate and probably independent of any involvement of Ca2+. 4. As in seminal plasma phospholipase A2, the activity in crude Naja naja venom towards sonicated radioactively labelled phosphatidylcholine was stimulated at low and inhibited at high concentrations of dibucaine and chloropromazine, for example. The mode of inhibition was seen to be competitive with respect to Ca2+, whereas stimulation by the anaesthetic drugs was independent of Ca2+. Binding between drug and enzyme was demonstrated by equilibration filtration of purified phospholipase A2 of Naja naja venom through a Sephadex G 25-fine column, previously equilibrated with 0.5 mM radioactively labelled chlorpromazine. 5. Lysophospholipase activity in rat liver cytosol towards radioactively labelled lysophosphatidylcholine was  inhibited by all local anaesthetics used; the order of decreasing potency was chlorpromazine, dibucaine, tetracaine, cocaine, lidocaine and procaine. The inhibition was un-competitive with respect to substrate. 6.

        "abstract": "Clinical studies have shown that pindolol can enhance the effects of antidepressant drugs, presumably by acting as an antagonist at somatodendritic 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)(1A) autoreceptors, which regulate the firing rate of central serotonergic neurons. The current study characterized the action of pindolol on the single-unit activity of serotonergic neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus of freely moving cats. (+/-)-Pindolol produced a dose-dependent inhibition of neuronal activity after i.v. (ED(50) = 0.25 mg/kg) and s.c. (ED(50) = 1.23 mg/kg) administration. The active enantiomer (-)-pindolol (1 mg/kg i.v.) also suppressed neuronal activity (maximal decrease, 88%). Upon p.o. administration, (+/-)-pindolol (10 mg/kg) produced a marked, long-acting suppression of neuronal activity similar to that observed after s.c. administration. In all cases, the reduction in firing rate produced by pindolol was completely reversed by low doses of N-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]-ethyl]-N-(2-pyridinyl)cycloh exanecarboxamide (WAY-100635) (0.1 mg/kg i.v. or 0.2 mg/kg s.c.), a selective 5-HT(1A) antagonist. Systemic administration of (-)-tertatolol (1-5 mg/kg i.v.), another beta-adrenoceptor blocker/putative 5-HT(1A) antagonist, had no significant effect on neuronal activity. The ability of i.v.

        "title": "Unique thermodynamic response of tipranavir to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 protease drug resistance mutations.",
        "abstract": "Drug resistance is a major problem affecting the clinical efficacy of antiretroviral agents, including protease inhibitors, in the treatment of infection with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)/AIDS. Consequently, the elucidation of the mechanisms by which HIV-1 protease inhibitors maintain antiviral activity in the presence of mutations is critical to the development of superior inhibitors. Tipranavir, a nonpeptidic HIV-1 protease inhibitor, has been recently approved for the treatment of HIV infection. Tipranavir inhibits wild-type protease with high potency (K(i) = 19 pM) and demonstrates durable efficacy in the treatment of patients infected with HIV-1 strains containing multiple common mutations associated with resistance. The high potency of tipranavir results from a very large favorable entropy change (-TDeltaS = -14.6 kcal/mol) combined with a favorable, albeit small, enthalpy change (DeltaH = -0.7 kcal/mol, 25 degrees C). Characterization of tipranavir binding to wild-type protease, active site mutants I50V and V82F/I84V, the multidrug-resistant mutant L10I/L33I/M46I/I54V/L63I/V82A/I84V/L90M, and the tipranavir in vitro-selected mutant I13V/V32L/L33F/K45I/V82L/I84V was performed by isothermal titration calorimetry and crystallography. Thermodynamically, the good response of tipranavir arises from a unique behavior: it compensates for entropic losses by actual enthalpic gains or by sustaining minimal enthalpic losses when facing the mutants. The net result is a small loss in binding affinity. Structurally, tipranavir establishes a very strong hydrogen bond network with invariant regions of the protease, which is maintained with the mutants, including catalytic Asp25 and the backbone of Asp29, Asp30, Gly48 and Ile50. Moreover, tipranavir forms hydrogen bonds directly to Ile50, while all other inhibitors do so by being mediated by a water molecule.",

We have conducted enzyme kinetics studies in a 4-nitrophenyl acetate (4-NPA) hydrolysis assay with the marketed antiepileptic drugs topiramate (1) and zonisamide (2) to determine if their full inhibition of human CA-II and CA-I requires extended preincubation conditions. We found that neither 1 nor 2 requires appreciable preincubation with either enzyme to manifest full inhibitory activity. We also examined the sulfamide cognate of topiramate (3) to characterize its CA inhibitory activity, and confirmed that it is a very weak inhibitor, unlike 1 or 2. In a CO(2) hydration assay, 3 behaved as a very weak, partial inhibitor of CA-II and CA-I.

        "abstract": "We report the first crystal structures of a penicillin-binding protein (PBP), PBP3, from Pseudomonas aeruginosa in native form and covalently linked to two important beta-lactam antibiotics, carbenicillin and ceftazidime. Overall, the structures of apo and acyl complexes are very similar; however, variations in the orientation of the amino-terminal membrane-proximal domain relative to that of the carboxy-terminal transpeptidase domain indicate interdomain flexibility. Binding of either carbenicillin or ceftazidime to purified PBP3 increases the thermostability of the enzyme significantly and is associated with local conformational changes, which lead to a narrowing of the substrate-binding cleft. The orientations of the two beta-lactams in the active site and the key interactions formed between the ligands and PBP3 are similar despite differences in the two drugs, indicating a degree of flexibility in the binding site. The conserved binding mode of beta-lactam-based inhibitors appears to extend to other PBPs, as suggested by a comparison of the PBP3/ceftazidime complex and the Escherichia coli PBP1b/ceftoxamine complex. Since P. aeruginosa is an important human pathogen, the structural data reveal the mode of action of the frontline antibiotic ceftazidime at the molecular level. Improved drugs to combat infections by P. aeruginosa and related Gram-negative bacteria are sought and our study provides templates to assist that process and allows us to discuss new ways of inhibiting PBPs.",

At therapeutic concentrations, ddCTP inhibits HIV replication by inhibiting the enzyme reverse transcriptase and terminating elongation of the proviral DNA chain. The results of 3 large pivotal trials comparing zidovudine monotherapy with combination therapy have now clearly established that zalcitabine plus zidovudine combination with an improvement in viral load and CD4+ cell count compared with zidovudine monotherapy. More recently, clinical end-point and surrogate marker data have established the efficacy of zalcitabine in combination with the protease inhibitor saquinavir in zidovudine-experienced patients. Other studies have demonstrated the utility of zalcitabine in combination with ritonavir and the nucleoside analogue lamivudine. Importantly, early use of zalcitabine in the treatment sequence does not appear to limit the therapeutic efficacy of subsequent therapy with other nucleoside analogues such as lamivudine. Peripheral neuropathy is the most frequent dose-limiting adverse effect associated with zalcitabine therapy and is generally reversible on discontinuation of treatment. Stomatitis and mouth ulcers may occur frequently with zalcitabine therapy but tend to resolve with continuing treatment. Haematological toxicity, which is a common adverse effect associated with zidovudine, is reported infrequently with zalcitabine. Overall, combination therapy with zalcitabine plus zidovudine or saquinavir has been shown to have a tolerability profile comparable to that of either agent alone, although treatment with zidovudine plus zalcitabine was associated with a significant increase in the incidence of haematological toxicity compared with zidovudine monotherapy in one study. Therefore, current data suggest that zalcitabine is a useful antiretroviral agent for inclusion as a component of initial double combination therapy with zidovudine or as part of triple combination therapy including zidovudine plus a protease inhibitor in the management of patients with HIV infection.",

In addition to acting as a histamine H1-receptor antagonist, azelastine also inhibits the production or release of many chemical mediators of the allergic response such as leukotrienes, free radicals, and cytokines. After nasal administration, azelastine is systemically absorbed with a bioavailability of about 40%. The side effects of azelastine are drowsiness, headache, and bitter taste. Azelastine has a rapid onset of action with a benefit in about 2 hours and a prolonged duration of activity (12 to 24 hours). Studies have shown azelastine to be more effective than placebo in terms of reduction of the major and total symptom complexes of allergic rhinitis. Comparison studies have demonstrated that azelastine is as effective as ebastine, loratadine, cetirizine hydrochloride, and terfenadine at symptom reduction, with varying results when compared with the corticosteroids budesonide and beclomethasone. Although there are conflicting studies, some have demonstrated that azelastine reduces the nasal congestion of allergic rhinitis. This feature that distinguishes it from oral antihistamines is of great interest because corticosteroids are known to be quite effective for the relief of nasal congestion, whereas the antihistamines are effective for the sneezing, itchy eyes, itchy nose, and watery eyes, but not the congestion. Azelastine nasal spray seems to be an efficacious treatment for allergic rhinitis with a rapid onset and long duration of activity, but without the systemic adverse effects of traditional sedating antihistamines.",

To improve understanding of the opioid receptor subtypes important for buprenorphine effects, we now report the results of our investigation on the roles of mu-, delta-, and kappa-opioid receptors in antinociceptive responses and place preferences induced by buprenorphine. Buprenorphine antinociception, assessed by hot-plate and tail-flick tests, was significantly reduced in heterozygous mu-opioid receptor knockout (MOR-KO) mice and abolished in homozygous MOR-KO mice. In contrast, buprenorphine retained its ability to establish a conditioned place preference (CPP) in homozygous MOR-KO, although the magnitude of place preference was reduced as the number of copies of wild-type mu-opioid receptor genes was reduced. The remaining CPP of buprenorphine was abolished by pretreatment with the nonselective opioid antagonist naloxone, but only partially blocked by pretreatment with either the delta-selective opioid antagonist naltrindole or the kappa-selective opioid antagonist norbinaltorphimine. These data, and biochemical confirmation of buprenorphine actions as a partial delta-, mu-, and kappa-agonist, support the ideas that mu-opioid receptors mediate most of analgesic properties of buprenorphine, but that mu- and delta- and/or kappa-opioid receptors are each involved in the rewarding effects of this drug.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The human histamine H1 receptor is constitutively active and exhibits basal activation of nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), an important modulator of allergic inflammation. Certain H1 antihistamines have recently been shown to inhibit basal NF-kappaB activity by stabilizing the H1 receptor in an inactive state, a phenomenon called 'inverse agonism'. METHODS: We evaluated the effect of the new H1 antihistamine, desloratadine, on basal and histamine-stimulated NF-kappaB activity and compared it with the activities of other H1 antihistamines. RESULTS: Transiently transfected COS-7 cells co-expressing NF-kappaB-luciferase and the H1 receptor exhibited constitutive NF-kappaB activity. H1 antihistamines reduced basal NF-kappaB activity (rank order of potency: desloratadine &gt; pyrilamine &gt; cetirizine &gt; loratadine &gt; fexofenadine). Histamine stimulated basal NF-kappaB activity 8-fold, which was blocked by H1 antihistamines (rank order of potency: desloratadine &gt; cetirizine &gt; pyrilamine &gt; loratadine &gt; fexofenadine). Neither histamine nor antihistamines had any effect on NF-kappaB activity in the absence of the H1 receptor. CONCLUSIONS: Desloratadine, acting through the histamine H1 receptor, inhibited basal NF-kappaB activity and can thus be classified as an inverse agonist. Inhibition of basal and histamine-stimulated NF-kappaB activity may help to explain previously reported inhibitory effects of desloratadine on allergic inflammatory mediators.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Telmisartan, an angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R) antagonist, was found to have a unique property: it is a partial agonist of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma). Since previous studies have demonstrated that PPARgamma activators suppressed AT1R expression, we examined whether telmisartan affects AT1R expression in vascular smooth muscle cells. METHODS: Vascular smooth muscle cells were derived from the thoracic aorta of Wistar-Kyoto rat. Northern and Western blotting analysis were used to examine AT1R mRNA and protein expression, respectively. The DEAE-dextran method was used for transfection, and the promoter activity of AT1R was examined by luciferase assay. RESULTS: Telmisartan decreased the expression of AT1R at the mRNA and protein levels in a dose- and time-dependent manner. Decreased AT1R promoter activity with unchanged mRNA stability suggested that telmisartan suppressed AT1R gene expression at the transcriptional level. However, the expression of AT1R was not suppressed by other AT1R antagonists such as candesartan or olmesartan. Since the suppression of AT1R expression was prevented by pretreatment with GW9662, a PPARgamma antagonist, PPARgamma should have participated in the process. The deletion and mutation analysis of the AT1R gene promoter indicated that a GC box located in the proximal promoter region is responsible for the telmisartan-induced downregulation. CONCLUSION: Our data provides a novel insight into an effect of telmisartan: telmisartan inhibits AT1R gene expression through PPARgamma activation. The dual inhibition of angiotensin II function by telmisartan - AT1R blockade and downregulation - would contribute to more complete inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system.",

Rivastigmine also inhibits BuChE, which could lead to additional benefits in late-stage Alzheimer's disease, but also cause more GI side effects at initiation of therapy. Galantamine is also an allosteric modulator of nicotinic receptors, which could lead to additional efficacy for attention and for behaviors mediated by neurotransmitters other than ACh. We are now entering an exciting era where the options for treating the devastating illness Alzheimer's disease are multiplying and creating a foundation upon which new therapies with new mechanisms of action can be built.",

        "abstract": "We examined clinical, morphologic, and cytogenetic features and ALL-1 (MLL, Htrxl, HRX) gene rearrangements in 17 cases of secondary leukemia that occurred 11 months to 9 years from diagnoses of primary cancers in children who received topoisomerase II inhibitors or developed secondary leukemias typical of those associated with this therapy. Primary diagnoses included nine solid tumors and eight leukemias. Ten secondary leukemias were acute myeloid leukemia (AML), one was of mixed lineage, two were acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), and four presented as myelodysplasia. Of 15 cases with 11q23 involvement, 11 (73%) were cytogenetically identifiable; four cases had molecular rearrangement only. By Southern blot, rearrangements within the ALL-1 gene were similar to sporadic cases. The results of this analysis suggest the following: (1) In most pediatric cases of topoisomerase II inhibitor-associated leukemia, there is disruption of the breakpoint cluster region of the ALL-1 gene at chromosomal band 11q23. (2) Exposure histories vary in secondary 11q23 leukemia, as the only topoisomerase II inhibitor was dactinomycin in one case, and, in another case, no topoisomerase II inhibitor was administered. (3) There is clinical, morphologic, cytogenetic, and molecular heterogeneity in pediatric secondary 11q23 leukemia. (4) There are some survivors of pediatric secondary 11q23 leukemia, but the outcome is most often fatal.",

        "title": "Evidence that tricyclic small molecules may possess toll-like receptor and myeloid differentiation protein 2 activity.",
        "abstract": "Opioids have been discovered to have Toll-like receptor (TLR) activity, beyond actions at classical opioid receptors. This raises the question whether other pharmacotherapies for pain control may also possess TLR activity, contributing to or opposing their clinical effects. We document that tricyclics can alter TLR4 and TLR2 signaling. In silico simulations revealed that several tricyclics docked to the same binding pocket on the TLR accessory protein, myeloid differentiation protein 2 (MD-2), as do opioids. Eight tricyclics were tested for effects on TLR4 signaling in HEK293 cells over-expressing human TLR4. Six exhibited mild (desipramine), moderate (mianserin, cyclobenzaprine, imiprimine, ketotifen) or strong (amitriptyline) TLR4 inhibition, and no TLR4 activation. In contrast, carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine exhibited mild and strong TLR4 activation, respectively, and no TLR4 inhibition. Amitriptyline but not carbamazepine also significantly inhibited TLR2 signaling in a comparable cell line. Live imaging of TLR4 activation in RAW264.7 cells and TLR4-dependent interleukin-1 release from BV-2 microglia revealed that amitriptyline blocked TLR4 signaling. Lastly, tricyclics with no (carbamazepine), moderate (cyclobenzeprine), and strong (amitriptyline) TLR4 inhibition were tested intrathecally (rats) and amitriptyline tested systemically in wildtype and knockout mice (TLR4 or MyD88). While tricyclics had no effect on basal pain responsivity, they potentiated morphine analgesia in rank-order with their potency as TLR4 inhibitors. This occurred in a TLR4/MyD88-dependent manner as no potentiation of morphine analgesia by amitriptyline occurred in these knockout mice. This suggests that TLR2 and TLR4 inhibition, possibly by interactions with MD2, contributes to effects of tricyclics in vivo. These studies provide converging lines of evidence that several tricyclics or their active metabolites may exert their biological actions, in part, via modulation of TLR4 and TLR2 signaling and suggest that inhibition of TLR4 and TLR2 signaling may potentially contribute to the efficacy of tricyclics in treating chronic pain and enhancing the analgesic efficacy of opioids.",

        "abstract": "Hyponatremia is the most frequent electrolyte disorder encountered in hospitalized patients. It is a state of relative water excess due to stimulated arginine vasopressin (AVP) and fluid intake greater than obligatory losses. This kind of hyponatremia occurs in the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion, congestive heart failure, and liver cirrhosis. Fluid restriction is the presently recommended treatment for hyponatremia. However, fluid restriction may be very difficult for patients to achieve, is slow to work, and does not allow a graded therapeutic approach. More efficient and specific treatments of hyponatremia are needed. In this respect, pharmacologic research has yielded a number of compounds exhibiting antagonistic qualities at the vasopressin V2 receptor. Among these agents, peptidic derivatives of AVP turned out to have intrinsic antidiuretic properties in vivo when given over days or weeks. The development of such agents for use in patients has not been pursued. However, several promising nonpeptide, vasopressin receptor antagonists have been described; these agents are VPA-985 (lixivaptan), YM-087 (conivaptan), OPC-41061 (tolvaptan), and SR-121463. Prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled trials performed with these agents found that they corrected hyponatremia efficiently and safely. Most of the studies were conducted over a 4- to 28-day period. Long-term studies will be needed in the future to address such issues as the eventual benefit to patients and the effects of vasopressin antagonists on morbidity and mortality of patients with hyponatremia.",

We have completed an extensive study of the pharmacological effects of these drugs on AMPK activation, adenine nucleotide concentration, transepithelial amiloride-sensitive (I(amiloride)) and ouabain-sensitive basolateral (I(ouabain)) short circuit current in H441 lung epithelial cells. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: H441 cells were grown on permeable filters at air interface. I(amiloride), I(ouabain) and transepithelial resistance were measured in Ussing chambers. AMPK activity was measured as the amount of radiolabelled phosphate transferred to the SAMS peptide. Adenine nucleotide concentration was analysed by reverse phase HPLC and NAD(P)H autofluorescence was measured using confocal microscopy. KEY RESULTS: Phenformin, AICAR and metformin increased AMPK (alpha1) activity and decreased I(amiloride). The AMPK inhibitor Compound C prevented the action of metformin and AICAR but not phenformin. Phenformin and AICAR decreased I(ouabain) across H441 monolayers and decreased monolayer resistance. The decrease in I(amiloride) was closely related to I(ouabain) with phenformin, but not in AICAR treated monolayers. Metformin and phenformin increased the cellular AMP:ATP ratio but only phenformin and AICAR decreased cellular ATP. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Activation of alpha1-AMPK is associated with inhibition of apical amiloride-sensitive Na(+) channels (ENaC), which has important implications for the clinical use of metformin. Additional pharmacological effects evoked by AICAR and phenformin on I(ouabain), with potential secondary effects on apical Na+ conductance, ENaC activity and monolayer resistance, have important consequences for their use as pharmacological activators of AMPK in cell systems where Na+K+ATPase is an important component.",

        "abstract": "Amino acid sequence alignments of cholinesterases revealed that 6 of 14 aromatic amino acid residues lining the active center gorge of acetylcholinesterase are replaced by aliphatic amino acid residues in butyrylcholinesterase. The Y337 (F330) in mammalian acetylcholinesterase, which is replaced by A328 in human butyrylcholinesterase, is implicated in the binding of ligands such as huperzine A, edrophonium, and acridines and one end of bisquaternary compounds such as BW284C51 and decamethonium. Y337 may sterically hinder the binding of phenothiazines such as ethopropazine, which contains a bulky exocyclic substitution. Inhibition studies of (-)-huperzine A with human butyrylcholinesterase mutants, where A328 (KI = 194.6 microM) was modified to either F (KI = 0.6 microM, as in Torpedo acetylcholinesterase) or Y (KI = 0.032 microM, as in mammalian acetylcholinesterase), confirmed previous observations made with acetylcholinesterase mutants that this residue is important for binding huperzine A. Inhibition studies of ethopropazine with butyrylcholinesterase mutants, where A328 (KI = 0.18 microM) was modified to either F (KI = 0.82 microM) or Y (KI = 0.28 microM), suggested that A328 was not solely responsible for the selectivity of ethopropazine. Volume calculations for the active site gorge showed that the poor inhibitory activity of ethopropazine toward acetylcholinesterase was due to the smaller dimension of the active site gorge which was unable to accommodate the bulky inhibitor molecule. The volume of the butyrylcholinesterase active site gorge is approximately 200 A3 larger than that of the acetylcholinesterase gorge, which allows the accommodation of ethopropazine in two different orientations as demonstrated by rigid-body refinement and molecular dynamics calculations.",

        "abstract": "beta-Endorphin is a non-selective opioid peptide which binds mu-, delta- and putative epsilon (beta-endorphin-sensitive non-mu-, non-delta- and non-kappa(1)-)-opioid receptors. We have previously reported that beta-endorphin-produced G-protein activation is mediated by the stimulation of both mu- and putative epsilon-opioid receptors. The present study was designed to further characterize this putative epsilon-opioid receptor-mediated G-protein activation in the pons/medulla membrane obtained from mice lacking mu-opioid receptor, using a guanosine-5'-O-(3-[(35)S]thio)triphosphate ([(35)S]GTPgammaS)-binding assay. beta-Endorphin and the mu-opioid receptor agonist [D-Ala(2),N-MePhe(4),Gly-ol(5)]enkephalin (DAMGO) increased the [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding in a concentration-dependent manner (0.001-10 microM), and at 10 microM beta-endorphin and DAMGO produced approximately 250 and 120% increases of [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding in the pons/medulla membrane obtained from wild-type mice, respectively. In the pons/medulla membrane obtained from mu-opioid receptor knockout mice, beta-endorphin-stimulated [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding was only partially attenuated and a more than 100% increase by 10 microM beta-endorphin still remained, while DAMGO failed to produce any increase in [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding. The residual increase in [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding by 10 microM beta-endorphin in mu-opioid receptor knockout mice was partially but significantly attenuated by the putative epsilon-opioid receptor partial agonist beta-endorphin (1-27), but not by the delta-opioid receptor antagonist naltrindole or the kappa(1)-receptor antagonist norbinaltorphimine. Furthermore, buprenorphine significantly attenuated the residual increase in [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding by 10 microM beta-endorphin in mu-opioid receptor knockout mice. The present results indicate that beta-endorphin activates G-protein by stimulation of putative epsilon-opioid receptors in the condition lacking the mu-opioid receptor, and buprenorphine acts as an antagonist for putative epsilon-opioid receptors in this condition.",

        "abstract": "Felodipine is unique among the dihydropyridine calcium antagonists in that it is the most potent in relaxing porcine coronary arteries (IC50 = 1.5 X 10(-10) M); it is not as sensitive to photoinactivation as nifedipine and nisoldipine, and it is fluorescent. The fluorescence of felodipine has allowed us to study many aspects of its interaction with various calcium-binding proteins in muscle, including calmodulin, skeletal troponin C, and cardiac troponin C. Calcium binding to the calcium-specific regulatory sites on these proteins exposes allosterically related felodipine-binding sites. The binding of other calmodulin antagonists and calcium antagonists, including prenylamine, R24571, and diltiazem, to these calcium-binding proteins abolishes the cooperativity between two felodipine-binding sites, resulting in felodipine binding to the remaining site with a 20-25-fold greater affinity. In addition, the binding of high-affinity drugs to these calcium-dependent hydrophobic sites on these calcium-binding proteins produces dramatic increases (40-50-fold) in their affinity for calcium. The affinity of felodipine for these calcium-binding proteins is 100-1,000 times lower than felodipine's IC50 for relaxing tension in coronary arteries, indicating that these calcium-binding proteins are probably not the primary receptors for felodipine. Similarities between the binding of dihydropyridines to the calcium channel and to these calcium-binding proteins have led us to suggest that a \"calmodulin-like\" calcium-binding protein on the calcium channel is the actual pharmacological receptor for dihydropyridine calcium channel antagonists.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

Azole binding to CaCYP51 was \"tight\" with both the type II spectral intensity (DeltaA(max)) and the azole concentration required to obtain a half-DeltaA(max) being proportional to the CaCYP51 concentration. Tight binding of fluconazole and itraconazole was confirmed by 50% inhibitory concentration determinations from CYP51 reconstitution assays. CaCYP51 had similar affinities for clotrimazole, econazole, itraconazole, ketoconazole, miconazole, and voriconazole, with K(d) values of 10 to 26 muM under oxidative conditions, compared with 47 muM for fluconazole. The affinities of CaCYP51 for fluconazole and itraconazole appeared to be 4- and 2-fold lower based on CO displacement studies than those when using direct ligand binding under oxidative conditions. Econazole and miconazole were most readily displaced by carbon monoxide, followed by clotrimazole, ketoconazole, and fluconazole, and then voriconazole (7.8 pmol min(-1)), but itraconzole could not be displaced by carbon monoxide. This work reports in depth the characterization of the azole binding properties of wild-type C. albicans CYP51, including that of voriconazole, and will contribute to effective screening of new therapeutic azole antifungal agents. Preliminary comparative studies with the I471T CaCYP51 protein suggested that fluconazole resistance conferred by this mutation was through a combination of increased turnover, increased affinity for substrate, and a reduced affinity for fluconazole in the presence of substrate, allowing the enzyme to remain functionally active, albeit at reduced velocity, at higher fluconazole concentrations.",

        "abstract": "UNLABELLED: Data emerging from the past 10 years have consolidated the rationale for investigating the use of aspirin as a chemopreventive agent; however, the mechanisms leading to its anticancer effects are still being elucidated. We hypothesized that aspirin's chemopreventive actions may involve cell-cycle regulation through modulation of the levels or activity of cyclin A2/cyclin-dependent kinase-2 (CDK2). In this study, HT-29 and other diverse panel of cancer cells were used to demonstrate that both aspirin and its primary metabolite, salicylic acid, decreased cyclin A2 (CCNA2) and CDK2 protein and mRNA levels. The downregulatory effect of either drugs on cyclin A2 levels was prevented by pretreatment with lactacystin, an inhibitor of proteasomes, suggesting the involvement of 26S proteasomes. In-vitro kinase assays showed that lysates from cells treated with salicylic acid had lower levels of CDK2 activity. Importantly, three independent experiments revealed that salicylic acid directly binds to CDK2. First, inclusion of salicylic acid in naive cell lysates, or in recombinant CDK2 preparations, increased the ability of the anti-CDK2 antibody to immunoprecipitate CDK2, suggesting that salicylic acid may directly bind and alter its conformation. Second, in 8-anilino-1-naphthalene-sulfonate (ANS)-CDK2 fluorescence assays, preincubation of CDK2 with salicylic acid dose-dependently quenched the fluorescence due to ANS. Third, computational analysis using molecular docking studies identified Asp145 and Lys33 as the potential sites of salicylic acid interactions with CDK2. These results demonstrate that aspirin and salicylic acid downregulate cyclin A2/CDK2 proteins in multiple cancer cell lines, suggesting a novel target and mechanism of action in chemoprevention. IMPLICATIONS: Biochemical and structural studies indicate that the antiproliferative actions of aspirin are mediated through cyclin A2/CDK2.",

        "abstract": "An in vitro model, the aggregating brain cell culture of fetal rat telencephalon, has been used to study the maturation-dependent sensitivity of brain cells to two organophosphorus pesticides (OPs), chlorpyrifos and parathion, and to their oxon derivatives. Immature (DIV 5-15) or differentiated (DIV 25-35) brain cells were treated continuously for 10 days. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibitory potency for the OPs was compared to that of eserine (physostigmine), a reversible AChE inhibitor. Oxon derivatives were more potent AChE inhibitors than the parent compounds, and parathion was more potent than chlorpyrifos. No maturation-dependent differences for AChE inhibition were found for chlorpyrifos and eserine, whereas for parathion and paraoxon there was a tendency to be more effective in immature cultures, while the opposite was true for chlorpyrifos-oxon. Toxic effects, assessed by measuring protein content as an index of general cytotoxicity, and various enzyme activities as cell-type-specific neuronal and glial markers (ChAT and GAD, for cholinergic and GABAergic neurons, respectively, and GS and CNP, for astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, respectively) were only found at more than 70% of AChE inhibition. Immature compared to differentiated cholinergic neurons appeared to be more sensitive to OP treatments. The oxon derivates were found to be more toxic on neurons than the parent compounds, and chlorpyrifos was more toxic than parathion. Eserine was not neurotoxic. These results indicate that inhibition of AChE remains the most sensitive macromolecular target of OP exposure, since toxic effects were found at concentrations in which AChE was inhibited. Furthermore, the compound-specific reactions, the differential pattern of toxicity of OPs compared to eserine, and the higher sensitivity of immature brain cells suggest that the toxic effects and inhibition of AChE are unrelated.",

The purpose of the present investigation was carried out to ascertain whether rivastigmine, a selective carbamate-type inhibitor of AChE, which inhibits selectively an isoform of this enzyme found almost exclusively in the central nervous system, is able to depress the intraocular pressure (IOP) in normotensive rabbits. IOP was monitored with a TonoPen XL in conscious adult rabbits before and hourly up to 8 hr after administration of the drug. Baseline measurements without treatment and after one single topical application of rivastigmine [1% (n=8); 2% (n=4); and 5% (n=6)] to the right eye and of the vehicle alone to the left one were performed. Rivastigmine reduced the IOP of treated eyes significantly (p&lt;0.05) in a dose-independent manner. Maximal effects of 23.2% (5% rivastigmine), 19.6% (2% rivastigmine) and 15.2% (1% rivastigmine) were achieved 1, 3 and 5 hr after application of the drug. A non-significant reduction of IOP in the contralateral eye was also observed. Rabbits evidenced no signs of discomfort after administration of rivastigmine. No conjunctival discharge or other signs of drug related local toxicity were found.

        "abstract": "Dorzolamide is a powerful inhibitor of carbonic anhydrase (CA) II that penetrates the sclera and cornea to reach the ciliary process and lowers formation of HCO3 and aqueous humor. The usual dose applied to the eye in treatment of glaucoma is 1 drop (30 microL of 2% solution) every 8 hr to each eye, or a total daily dose of 4 mg. On this regime, the red cells accumulated drug over a period of 8 days, reaching a value of 20-25 microM, which corresponds to the concentration of CA II in human red cells. This drug concentration persisted throughout the 18 months of application. The plasma concentration was 0.034 microM, or 1/700 that of the red cells. This plasma concentration corresponds to that calculated from the dilution of administered drug into body water. The data are well fitted into the equilibrium expression for KI of dorzolamide against CA II at 37 degrees C, as 8 x 10(-9) M. The red cells also contain a small amount (5 microM) of the N-des-ethyl metabolite, probably reflecting its modest binding to CA I. In the initial 8-day drug period, virtually none appeared in the urine since CA II sites were being filled. At steady state, renal excretion was 1.3 mg/day and the renal clearance 90 ml/min. These excretion numbers include the small (20%) amount of the des-ethyl metabolite of dorzolamide. The relation of these data to lowering of intraocular pressure is clear. By the systemic route, an inhibitor such as acetazolamide is effective when free drug concentration in plasma is 2.5 microM. In the case of topical drugs, as shown here, the plasma concentration is some 100 x lower, but the concentration in ciliary process is 2-10 microM, comparable to that following systemic drugs (1). In conclusion, the concentration in plasma (reflecting free drug) of dorzolamide is about 1/200 of that needed for systemic effects as seen following acetazolamide or methazolamide. Thus, there is a clear pharmacological basis for the lack of any physiological effects of ocular dorzolamide, except on the eye itself.",

        "abstract": "In addition to its well known sedative and teratogenic effects, thalidomide also possesses potent immunomodulatory and antiinflammatory activities, being most effective against leprosy and chronic graft-versus-host disease. The immunomodulatory activity of thalidomide has been ascribed to the selective inhibition of tumor necrosis factor alpha from monocytes. The molecular mechanism for the immunomodulatory effect of thalidomide remains unknown. To elucidate this mechanism, we synthesized an active photoaffinity label of thalidomide as a probe to identify the molecular target of the drug. Using the probe, we specifically labeled a pair of proteins of 43-45 kDa with high acidity from bovine thymus extract. Purification of these proteins and partial peptide sequence determination revealed them to be alpha1-acid glycoprotein (AGP). We show that the binding of thalidomide photoaffinity label to authentic human AGP is competed with both thalidomide and the nonradioactive photoaffinity label at concentrations comparable to those required for inhibition of production of tumor necrosis factor alpha from human monocytes, suggesting that AGP may be involved in the immunomodulatory activity of thalidomide.",

The clinical curative effect of the present treatments and drugs for hepatocarcinoma are not so satisfactory. The inducing effect of topotecan on apoptosis of hepatocarcinoma cell line HepG2 and its cytotoxicity on HepG2 were studied in this paper. METHODS: Microculture tetrazolium assay (MTT), HE staining, transmission electron microscope (TEM), flow cytometer (FCM) and immunohistochemistry were employed to determine and observe the apoptosis of HepG2 induced by topotecan and its lethal action on HepG2. RESULTS: Topotecan killed HepG2 cell by inducing apoptosis. Topotecan had strong anti-HepG2 activity in vitro, suggesting distinct dose- and time-dependent relationship. The drug IC50 was about 95 micrograms/L. Topotecan block HepG2 in S-phase, then further initiate apoptosis program. The morphologic characteristic of apoptosis showed that it is a typical interphase apoptosis process: the nuclei showed chromatin pycnosis, and clustered on the inner border of karyotheca, cytoplasm condensed, many vacuoles occurred in it. The expression of bcl-2 were not affected in the course of HepG2 apoptosis induced by topotecon (P &gt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: Topotecan had significant cytotoxicity on HepG2 by inducing apoptosis.",

In contrast, it was found to be a much weaker inhibitor of human carbonic anhydrase isoenzyme I (IC50 value of 600 nM). The topical administration of one 50 microliters drop of 0.5%, 1% and 2% solutions of dorzolamide maximally lowered the intraocular pressure (IOP) of glaucomatous monkeys by 22%, 30% and 37%, respectively. Good ocular hypotensive activity was also observed in ocular normotensive and hypertensive rabbits. Its site of action was within the eye, and the reductions in IOP in both species was achieved via decreased aqueous humor inflow. The duration of action of 2% dorzolamide was shorter than that of 0.5% timolol in glaucomatous monkeys. The IOP lowering activity of timolol in this paradigm was enhanced by the concomitant instillation of dorzolamide. Both acutely and repeatedly administered 2% dorzolamide did not decrease regional ocular blood flow in the rabbit, and the topical instillation of the drug had no adverse effects on the eye of rabbits, dogs and monkeys. Dorzolamide has been approved in a number of countries for use in patients with ocular hypertension or open-angle glaucoma.",

In the method employed the capillary was first filled with 30 mM borate-phosphate buffer (pH 8.0) and subsequently, plugs of: (i) water, (ii) AChE solution, (iii) substrate solution with or without inhibitor, (iv) AChE solution, and (v) water, were hydrodynamically injected into the capillary, and were allowed to stand (and react) during a waiting period of 2 min. The applicability of the proposed methodology to estimate different kinetic parameters of interest such as inhibition constants K(i), identification of inhibitory action mechanism and IC(50), is evaluated using compounds with known activity, tacrine edrophonium, and neostigmine.

Rats were subjected to left coronary artery occlusion to induce myocardial infarction, which in turn led to congestive heart failure. At 4 weeks after coronary occlusion, conivaptan (0.03, 0.1 and 0.3 mg/kg i.v.) dose-dependently increased urine volume and reduced urine osmolality in both myocardial infarction and sham-operated rats. SR121463A (0.3 mg/kg i.v.) also increased urine volume and decreased urine osmolality in myocardial infarction rats, to a degree comparable to that by conivaptan (0.3 mg/kg i.v.). At 6 weeks after surgery, myocardial infarction rats showed increases in right ventricular systolic pressure, right atrial pressure, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and relative weights of the heart and the lungs, and a decrease in first derivative of left ventricular pressure (dP/dt(max))/left ventricular pressure, showing that congestive heart failure was well established. Conivaptan (0.3 mg/kg i.v.) significantly reduced right ventricular systolic pressure, left ventricular end-diastolic pressure, lung/body weight and right atrial pressure in myocardial infarction rats. Moreover, conivaptan (0.3 mg/kg i.v.) significantly increased dP/dt(max)/left ventricular pressure. SR121463A at a dose of 0.3 mg/kg i.v. significantly decreased left ventricular end-diastolic pressure and right atrial pressure, and tended to decrease right ventricular systolic pressure and relative lung weight in myocardial infarction rats. Although the aquaretic and preload-reducing effects of SR121463A were similar to those of conivaptan, SR121463A failed to improve dP/dt(max)/left ventricular pressure. These results suggest that dual vasopressin V1A and V2 receptor antagonists provide greater benefit than selective vasopressin V2 receptor antagonists in the treatment of congestive heart failure.",

This study with native, wild-type, and mutant recombinant DNA-expressed AChEs, each inhibited by representative OP compounds, establishes a relationship between edrophonium acceleration of oxime-induced reactivation of OP-AChE conjugates and phosphoryl oxime inhibition of the reactivated enzyme that occurs during reactivation by pyridinium oximes LuH6 and TMB4. No such recurring inhibition could be observed with HI-6 as the reactivator due to the extreme lability of the phosphoryl oximes formed by this oxime. Phosphoryl oximes formed during reactivation of the ethoxy methylphosphonyl-AChE conjugate by LuH6 and TMB4 were isolated for the first time and their structures confirmed by (31)P NMR. However, phosphoryl oximes formed during the reactivation of the diethylphosphoryl-AChE conjugate were not sufficiently stable to be detected by (31)P NMR. The purified ethoxy methylphosphonyl oximes formed during the reactivation of ethoxy methylphosphonyl-AChE conjugate with LuH6 and TMB4 are 10- to 22-fold more potent than MEPQ as inhibitors of AChE and stable for several hours at pH 7.2 in HEPES buffer. Reactivation of both ethoxy methylphosphonyl- and diethylphosphoryl-AChE by these two oximes was accelerated in the presence of rabbit serum paraoxonase, suggesting that organophosphorus hydrolase can hydrolyze phosphoryl oxime formed during the reactivation. Our results emphasize that certain oximes, such as LuH6 and TMB4, if used in the treatment of OP pesticide poisoning may cause prolonged inhibition of AChE due to formation of phosphoryl oximes.",

        "abstract": "Opioid analgesics are the standard therapeutic agents for the treatment of pain, but their prolonged use is limited because of the development of tolerance and dependence. Recently, we reported the development of a mu-opioid receptor knock-in (KI) mouse in which the mu-opioid receptor was replaced by a mutant receptor (S196A) using a homologous recombination gene-targeting strategy. In these animals, the opioid antagonist naltrexone elicited antinociceptive effects similar to those of partial agonists acting in wild-type (WT) mice; however, development of tolerance and physical dependence were greatly reduced. In this study, we test the hypothesis that the failure of naltrexone to produce tolerance in these KI mice is attributable to its simultaneous inhibition of delta-opioid receptors and activation of mu-opioid receptors. Simultaneous implantation of a morphine pellet and continuous infusion of the delta-opioid receptor antagonist naltrindole prevented tolerance development to morphine in both WT and KI animals. Moreover, administration of SNC-80 [(+)-4-[(alphaR)-alpha-((2S,5R)-4-allyl-2,5-dimethyl-1-piperazinyl)-3-methoxybenzyl]-N,N-diethylbenzamide], a delta agonist, in the naltrexone-pelleted KI animals resulted in a dose-dependent induction in tolerance development to both morphine- and naltrexone-induced analgesia. We conclude that although simultaneous activation of both mu- and delta-opioid receptors results in tolerance development, mu-opioid receptor activation in conjunction with delta-opioid receptor blockade significantly attenuates the development of tolerance.",

However, BuChE activity progressively increases in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), while AChE activity remains unchanged or declines. Both enzymes therefore represent legitimate therapeutic targets for ameliorating the cholinergic deficit considered to be responsible for the declines in cognitive, behavioral and global functioning characteristic of AD. The two enzymes differ in substrate specificity, kinetics and activity in different brain regions. Experimental evidence from the use of agents with enhanced selectivity for BuChE (cymserine analogues, MF-8622) and the dual inhibitor of both AChE and BuChE, rivastigmine, indicates potential therapeutic benefits of inhibiting both AChE and BuChE in AD and related dementias. Recent evidence suggests that both AChE and BuChE may have roles in the aetiology and progression of AD beyond regulation of synaptic ACh levels. The development of specific BuChE inhibitors and further experience with the dual enzyme inhibitor rivastigmine will improve understanding of the aetiology of AD and should lead to a wider variety of potent treatment options.",

In the European Union, about 54% of dementia cases are believed to be due to Alzheimer's disease. The condition is an age-related neurodegenerative disorder characterized by multiple cognitive deficiencies, including loss of memory, judgment, and comprehension. These manifestations are accompanied by behavioral and mood disturbances. Although no cure has yet been discovered for Alzheimer's disease, symptomatic therapies are now widely available and offer significant relief to patients and benefits to caregivers in terms of reduced care burden. At the start of the 21st century, health technology assessments recommended three agents for the symptomatic treatment of mild to moderate Alzheimer disease: rivastigmine, donepezil, and galantamine. Rivastigmine (Exelon, Novartis Basel-Switzerland) is a slowly reversible inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE), while donepezil (Aricept, Pfizer, New York, USA) and galantamine (Reminyl, Janssen, New Jersey, USA) show no functional inhibition of BuChE, and are considered AChE-selective, rapidly-reversible inhibitors. The efficacy of all three agents has been evaluated in large, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials of up to 6 months' duration. Rivastigmine treatment in mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease improves cognition, activities of daily living, and global function.",

The loss of alpha 2-macroglobulin receptors is independent of receptor occupancy and is rapidly reversed upon removal of these agents from the culture medium. The extent of EGF receptor loss is less than for alpha 2-macroglobulin, and the EGF receptors do not reappear at the surface when W-7 is removed. Receptor loss was measured as a change in the capacity for binding iodinated ligands; no change in affinity of binding was observed. This receptor loss could reflect inactivation of receptors or internalization. W-7 did not induce a loss of cell surface beta 2-microglobulin, a membrane protein which is excluded from coated pits and which is not internalized, indicating that the effect of W-7 was specific for membrane receptors and not a result of bulk depletion of plasma membrane. The loss of alpha 2-macroglobulin and EGF receptors occurs at concentrations which do not cause an increase in the pH of endocytic vesicles or the cytoplasm, indicating that these agents act by a mechanism distinct from the effect of other weak bases. Since both TFP and W-7 are potent inhibitors of calmodulin, we investigated the possibility that inhibition of calmodulin was responsible for the loss of receptors. Three lines of evidence suggest that calmodulin inhibition is not responsible for the inhibition of binding and endocytosis: 1) Promethazine, a phenothiazine that is a poor inhibitor of calmodulin, is nearly as effective as TFP at inhibiting endocytosis; calmidazolium, a potent inhibitor of several calmodulin functions, did not cause a loss of binding; 2) the microinjection of calmodulin into cells did not reverse the effects of W-7; using pressure microinjection, we introduced up to a 100-fold excess of calmodulin over native levels into individual gerbil fibroma cells; using rhodamine-labeled alpha 2-macroglobulin, we saw that the W-7 induced inhibition of receptor-mediated endocytosis was the same in injected and uninjected cells; 3) we injected calcineurin, a calmodulin-binding protein, into cells (1-3 pg/cell) and observed no effect on the receptor-mediated endocytosis of rhodamine-labeled alpha 2-macroglobulin. These data indicated that cell surface receptor numbers can be regulated by a cellular component that is not cytoplasmic calmodulin but that shares some drug sensitivities with calmodulin.",

        "abstract": "We have identified a highly active Ca2+ calmodulin-dependent protein kinase in the cytoskeletons of normal (bovine fasciculata) and transformed (Y-1 mouse tumor) adrenal cells. In view of evidence for the involvement of calmodulin and microfilaments in the regulation of cholesterol transport and hence steroidogenesis, it is likely that this kinase is important in this process. The kinase activity was examined for its capacity to phosphorylate endogenous proteins analyzed by one- and two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, in the presence of saturating amounts of Ca2+ (5 mM) and calmodulin (5 microM). Three inhibitors of calmodulin (trifluoperazine, pimozide and W-7) inhibit steroidogenesis and Ca2(+)-calmodulin-dependent phosphorylation kinase activity with similar values for EC50 for the two processes. All three inhibitors inhibit the increased transport of cholesterol to mitochondria in response to ACTH. Two substrates for the kinase (alpha-spectrin and beta-tubulin) were identified and two others (51,000 and 60,000 molecular weight) were tentatively identified as the subunits of the kinase itself in cytoskeletons of both cell types. Calmodulin-binding proteins analyzed by [125I]iodocalmodulin overlay and calmodulin-Sepharose affinity chromatography were also identified in the same cytoskeletons including alpha-spectrin, the Ca2+ calmodulin-dependent phosphatase calcineurin and three that were tentatively identified as the two subunits of the kinase itself and myosin light chain kinase. It is concluded that calmodulin, by binding to the kinase and phosphatase, is capable of influencing the degree of phosphorylation of specific substrates in the cytoskeleton and of forming complexes with spectrin, actin and tubulin. These events may be involved in the regulation of the rate-limiting step of steroidogenesis, i.e. transport of cholesterol to mitochondria.",

        "abstract": "Ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug widely used to relieve pain and inflammation in many disorders via inhibition of cyclooxygenases. Recently, we have demonstrated that ibuprofen inhibits intracellular signaling of RhoA and promotes significant axonal growth and functional recovery following spinal cord lesions in rodents. In addition, another study suggests that ibuprofen reduces generation of amyloid-beta42 peptide via inactivation of RhoA signaling, although it may also regulate amyloid-beta42 formation by direct inhibition of the gamma-secretase complex. The molecular mechanisms by which ibuprofen inhibits the RhoA signal in neurons, however, remain unclear. Here, we report that the transcription factor peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor gamma (PPARgamma) is essential for coupling ibuprofen to RhoA inhibition and subsequent neurite growth promotion in neurons. Ibuprofen activates PPARgamma in neuron-like PC12 and B104 cells. Activation of PPARgamma with traditional agonists mimics the RhoA-inhibiting properties of ibuprofen in PC12 cells and, like ibuprofen, promotes neurite elongation in primary cultured neurons exposed to axonal growth inhibitors. Protein knockdown with small interfering RNA specific for PPARgamma blocks RhoA suppression of PPARgamma agonists in PC12 cells. Moreover, the effect of ibuprofen on RhoA activity and neurite growth in neuronal cultures is prevented by selective PPARgamma inhibition. These findings support that PPARgamma plays an essential role in mediating the RhoA-inhibiting effect of ibuprofen. Elucidation of the novel molecular mechanisms linking ibuprofen to RhoA inhibition may provide additional therapeutic targets to the disorders characterized by RhoA activation, including spinal cord injuries and Alzheimer's disease.",

        "abstract": "The statins are inhibitors of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase (HMG-CoAR), and are utilized to decrease levels of atherogenic lipoproteins in patients with, or who are at high risk of, cardiovascular disease. This study describes the inhibition of a recombinant, catalytic fragment of human HMG-CoAR by a new statin, rosuvastatin (CRESTOR(R)). Binding is reversible and involves an initial complex [inhibition constant involving the enzyme-inhibitor complex (E.I), K (i), approximately 1 nM], which undergoes a slow transition ( t ((1/2)) to reach steady state is 33-360 s) to give tighter association [steady-state inhibition constant involving E.I and the second E.I complex in a two-step mechanism (E.I*), K (i)*, approximately 0.1 nM]. At steady state, rosuvastatin is at least as potent as atorvastatin, cerivastatin and simvastatin. It is more potent than fluvastatin and pravastatin. For rosuvastatin, inhibition kinetics are competitive with respect to HMG-CoA and non-competitive when NADPH is varied. At 37 degrees C, binding is linked to a large favourable enthalpy change [Delta H degrees =-69.0 kJ/mol (-16.5 kcal/mol)] and a small entropic penalty [ T Delta S degrees =-9.6 kJ/mol (-2.3 kcal/mol)]. These characteristics, and the high affinity relative to that of 3 S -HMG-CoA ( K (d) approximately 6.6 microM), are discussed in relation to the crystal structures of complexes with HMG-CoAR.",

This study examined concurrently the concentrations of chlorpheniramine and presence of H1-receptor antagonist in plasma after administration of 8 mg chlorpheniramine in normal volunteers. Six extensive metabolizers and five poor metabolizers, as judged by CYP2D6 phenotype (dextromethorphan metabolic ratio), were enrolled in the study. More than 80% occupancy of H1-receptors by antagonist in plasma was observed for 12 hours after the dose in extensive metabolizers and greater than 60% from 12 to 30 hours in poor metabolizers, when plasma concentrations had fallen below those that should result in 50% occupancy of receptors. The results suggest that (+/-)-chlorpheniramine plasma concentrations do not predict H1-receptor antagonist in plasma.

Here, we examined direct protective effects of atorvastatin on neurones in different cell damage models in vitro. Primary cortical neurones were pre-treated with atorvastatin and then exposed to (i) glutamate, (ii) oxygen-glucose deprivation or (iii) several apoptosis-inducing compounds. Atorvastatin significantly protected from glutamate-induced excitotoxicity as evidenced by propidium iodide staining, nuclear morphology, release of lactate dehydrogenase, and mitochondrial tetrazolium metabolism, but not from oxygen-glucose deprivation or apoptotic cell death. This anti-excitototoxic effect was evident with 2-4 days pre-treatment but not with daily administration or shorter-term pre-treatment. The protective properties occurred independently of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibition because co-treatment with mevalonate or other isoprenoids did not reverse or attenuate neuroprotection. Atorvastatin attenuated the glutamate-induced increase of intracellular calcium, which was associated with a modulation of NMDA receptor function. Taken together, atorvastatin exerts specific anti-excitotoxic effects independent of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA reductase inhibition, which has potential therapeutic implications.",

        "title": "Memantine alters striatal plasticity inducing a shift of synaptic responses toward long-term depression.",
        "abstract": "Memantine is an open channel blocker that antagonizes NMDA receptors reducing the inappropriate calcium (Ca(2+)) influx occurring in presence of moderately increased glutamate levels. At the same time, memantine has the ability to preserve the transient physiological activation of NMDA receptor, essential for learning and memory formation at synaptic level. In the present study we investigated the effects exerted by memantine on striatal synaptic plasticity in rat striatal spiny projection neurons (SPNs). In vitro application of memantine in striatal slices elicited a disruption of long-term potentiation (LTP) induction and maintenance, and revealed, in the majority of the recorded neurons, a long-term depression (LTD), whose amplitude was concentration-dependent (0.3-10 muM). Interestingly, preincubation with the dopamine (DA) D2 receptor antagonist sulpiride (10 muM) prevented memantine-induced LTD and restored LTP. Moreover, the DA D2 agonist quinpirole (10 muM), similarly to memantine, induced LTD in a subgroup of SPNs. In addition, memantine-induced LTD was also prevented by the CB1 endocannabinoid receptor antagonist AM 251 (1 muM). These results suggest that the actions exerted by memantine on striatal synaptic plasticity, and in particular the induction of LTD observed in SPNs, could be attributed to its ability to activate DA D2 receptors. By contrast, blockade of NMDA receptor is not involved in memantine-induced LTD since APV (30 muM) and MK801 (10 muM), two NMDA receptor antagonists, failed to induce this form of synaptic plasticity. Our data indicate that memantine could be used as treatment of neurological disorders in which DA D2 receptor represents a possible therapeutic target.",

The binding of [3H]SR 142948A in brain membrane homogenates was specific, time-dependent, reversible and saturable. [3H]SR 142948A bound to an apparently homogeneous population of sites, with a Kd of 3.5 nM and a Bmax value of 508 fmol/mg of protein, which was 80% higher than that observed in saturation experiments with [3H]neurotensin. [3H]SR 142948A binding was inhibited by SR 142948A, the related nonpeptide receptor antagonist, SR 48692 (2-[[1-(7-chloroquinolin-4-yl)-5-(2,6-dimethoxyphenyl)-1H-pyrazole -3-carbonyl]amino]-adamantane-2-carboxylic acid) and neurotensin. Saturation and competition studies in the presence or absence of the histamine H1 receptor antagonist, levocabastine, revealed that [3H]SR 142948A bound with similar affinities to both the levocabastine-insensitive neurotensin NT1 receptors (20% of the total binding population) and the recently cloned levocabastine-sensitive neurotensin NT2 receptors (80% of the receptors) (Kd = 6.8 and 4.8 nM, respectively). The regional distribution of [3H]SR 142948A binding in the rat brain closely matched the distribution of [125I]neurotensin binding. In conclusion, these findings indicate that [3H]SR 142948A is a new potent antagonist radioligand which recognizes with high affinity both neurotensin NT1 and NT2 receptors and represents thus an excellent tool to study neurotensin receptors in the rat brain.",

Therefore, it is possible that some motor components of maternal behaviour might be mediated by concurrent dopaminergic stimulation. It has been previously demonstrated that peripheral injections of some antipsychotic drugs such as pimozide have disruptive effects on maternal behaviour. The present experiments were designed to verify the effects of pharmacological blockade of limbic dopamine receptors on ongoing maternal behaviour in lactating rats. The hypothesis that central injections of the drug pimozide would have an effect on maternal behaviour was tested. We investigated the effects of central bilateral intra-accumbens microinjections of the dopamine D2 receptor antagonist pimozide (1.5 and 3.0 microg) on maternal behaviour. Animals treated with 3.0 microg of pimozide showed significantly longer latencies for all parameters of maternal behaviour compared to controls. These results suggest that dopamine receptors in the nucleus accumbens play a role in ongoing maternal behaviour.",

        "abstract": "Synthetic gabapentinoids, exemplified by gapapentin and pregabalin, are in extensive clinical use for indications including epilepsy, neuropathic pain, anxiety, and alcohol withdrawal. Their mechanisms of action are incompletely understood, but are thought to involve inhibition of alpha2delta subunit-containing voltage-gated calcium channels. Here, we report that gabapentin is a potent activator of the heteromeric KCNQ2/3 voltage-gated potassium channel, the primary molecular correlate of the neuronal M-current, and also homomeric KCNQ3 and KCNQ5 channels. In contrast, the structurally related gabapentinoid, pregabalin, does not activate KCNQ2/3, and at higher concentrations (&gt;=10 microM) is inhibitory. Gabapentin activation of KCNQ2/3 (EC50 = 4.2 nM) or homomeric KCNQ3* (EC50 = 5.3 nM) channels requires KCNQ3-W265, a conserved tryptophan in KCNQ3 transmembrane segment 5. Homomeric KCNQ2 or KCNQ4 channels are insensitive to gabapentin, whereas KCNQ5 is highly sensitive (EC50 = 1.9 nM). Given the potent effects and the known anticonvulsant, antinociceptive, and anxiolytic effects of M-channel activation, our findings suggest the possibility of an unexpected role for M-channel activation in the mechanism of action of gabapentin.",

        "abstract": "The mechanism of the anti-anginal effect of perhexiline is unclear but appears to involve a shift in cardiac metabolism from utilization of fatty acid to that of carbohydrate. We tested the hypothesis that perhexiline inhibits the enzyme carnitine palmitoyltransferase-1 (CPT-1), which controls access of long chain fatty acids to the mitochondrial site of beta-oxidation. Perhexiline produced a concentration-dependent inhibition of CPT-1 in rat cardiac and hepatic mitochondria in vitro, with half-maximal inhibition (IC50) at 77 and 148 mumol/L, respectively. Amiodarone, another drug with anti-anginal properties, also inhibited cardiac CPT-1 (IC50 = 228 mumol/L). The rank order of potency for inhibition was malonyl-CoA &gt; 4-hydroxyphenylglyoxylate (HPG) = perhexiline &gt; amiodarone = monohydroxy-perhexiline. Kinetic analysis revealed competitive inhibition of cardiac and hepatic CPT-1 by perhexiline with respect to palmitoyl-CoA but non-competitive inhibition with respect to carnitine. Curvilinear Dixon plots generated \"apparent inhibitory constant (Ki)\" values for perhexiline, which indicated a greater sensitivity of the cardiac than the hepatic enzyme to inhibition by perhexiline. Perhexiline inhibition of CPT-1, unlike that of malonyl-CoA and HPG, was unaffected by pretreatment with the protease nagarse. These data establish for the first time that two agents with proven anti-anginal effects inhibit cardiac CPT-1. This action is likely to contribute to the anti-ischaemic effects of both perhexiline and amiodarone.",

        "abstract": "We evaluated the acute effects of ibuprofen and salicylic acid on cAMP-mediated Cl- secretion (Isc) in both colonic and airway epithelia. In T84 cells, ibuprofen inhibited the forskolin-dependent Isc in a concentration-dependent manner, having an apparent Ki of 142 microM. Salicylic acid inhibited Isc with an apparent Ki of 646 microM. We determined whether ibuprofen would also inhibit the forskolin-stimulated Isc in primary cultures of mouse trachea epithelia (MTE) and human bronchial epithelia (HBE). Similar to our results in T84 cells, ibuprofen (500 microM) inhibited the forskolin-induced Isc in MTEs and HBEs by 59+/-4% (n = 11) and 39+/-6% (n = 8), respectively. Nystatin was employed to selectively permeabilize the basolateral or apical membrane to determine the effect of ibuprofen on apical Cl- (ICl) and basolateral K+ (IK) currents after stimulation by forskolin. After forskolin stimulation, ibuprofen (500 microM) reduced both the ICl and IK; reducing ICl and IK by 60 and 15%, respectively. To determine whether this inhibition of ICl was due to the inhibition of CFTR, the effects of ibuprofen and salicylic acid on CFTR Cl- channels in excised, inside-out patches from L-cells were evaluated. Ibuprofen (300 microM) reduced CFTR Cl- current by 60+/-16% and this was explained by a short-lived block (approximately 1.2 ms) which causes an apparent reduction in single channel amplitude from 1.07+/-0.04 pA to 0.59+/-0.04 pA (n = 3). Similarly, salicylic acid (3 mM) reduced CFTR Cl- current by 50+/-8% with an apparent reduction in single channel amplitude from 1.08+/-0.03 pA to 0.48+/-0.06 pA (n = 4). Based on these results, we conclude that the NSAIDs ibuprofen and salicylic acid inhibit cAMP-mediated Cl- secretion in human colonic and airway epithelia via a direct inhibition of CFTR Cl- channels as well as basolateral membrane K+ channels. This may reduce their efficacy in conjunction with other therapeutic strategies designed to increase CFTR expression and/or function in secretory epithelia.",

        "abstract": "A new pharmacophoric model for the H1-antagonist binding site is derived which reveals that a simple atom to atom matching of compounds is not sufficient; in this model, interacting residues from the receptor need to be included. To obtain this model, the bioactive conformations of several (semi-)rigid classical histamine H1-receptor antagonists have been investigated (cyproheptadine, phenindamine, triprolidine, epinastine, mequitazine, IBF28145, and mianserine). In general, these antihistamines contain two aromatic rings and a basic nitrogen atom. A previously derived pharmacophoric model with the nitrogen position fixed relative to the two aromatic rings is now found not to be suitable for describing the H1-antagonist binding site. A procedure is described which allows for significant freedom in the position of the basic nitrogen of the histamine H1-antagonist. The area accessible to the basic nitrogen is confined to the region accessible to its counterion on the histamine H1-receptor, i.e., the carboxylate group of Asp116. The basic nitrogen is assumed to form an ionic hydrogen bond with this aspartic acid which C alpha- and C beta-carbons are fixed with respect to the protein backbone. Via this hydrogen bond, the direction of the acidic proton of the antagonist is taken into account. Within these computational procedures, an aspartic acid is coupled to the basic nitrogen of each H1-antagonist considered; the carboxylate group is connected to the positively charged nitrogen via geometric H-bonding restraints obtained from a thorough database search (CSD). Also to the basic nitrogen of the pharmacophore is coupled an aspartic acid (to yield our new template). In order to derive a model for the H1-antagonist binding site, the aromatic ring systems of the antagonists and template are matched according to a previously described procedure. Subsequently, the C alpha- and C beta-carbons of the aspartic acid coupled to the H1-antagonists are matched with those of the template in a procedure which allows the antagonist and the carboxylate group to adapt their conformation (and also their relative position) in order to optimize the overlap with the template. A six-point pharmacophoric model is derived which has stereoselective features and is furthermore able to distinguish between the so-called \"cis\"- and \"trans\"-rings mentioned in many (Q)SAR studies on H1-antagonists. Due to its stereoselectivity, the model is able to designate the absolute bioactive configuration of antihistamines such as phenindamine (S), epinastine (S), and IBF28145 (R). A further merit of this study is that a model is obtained which includes an amino acid from the receptor.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",

METHODS AND RESULTS: Circulating MNCs were isolated from the peripheral blood of healthy subjects. Compared with control condition, pretreatment of carvedilol (10 micromol/L for 18 hours) or probucol (5 micromol/L for 18 hours), but not propanolol, prazosin, or both propanolol and prazosin significantly decreased TNF-alpha-stimulated adhesiveness of cultured human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) to MNCs. Carvedilol inhibited TNF-alpha-stimulated endothelial vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and E-selectin (66.0+/-2.0% and 55.60+/-1.0% of control, P&lt;0.05, respectively) expression, whereas probucol inhibited only VCAM-1 expression (79.0+/-5.0% of control, P&lt;0.05). Propanolol, prazosin, or both did not alter the expression of adhesion molecules. Further, pretreatment with carvedilol significantly inhibited TNF-alpha-stimulated intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) production and the activation of redox sensitive nuclear factor kappa B and activator protein-1 transcription pathways. CONCLUSIONS: Carvedilol reduced TNF-alpha-stimulated endothelial adhesiveness to human MNCs by inhibiting intracellular ROS production, transcription factor activation, and VCAM-1 as well as E-selectin expression, suggesting its potential role in clinical atherosclerosis disease.",

        "abstract": "Ambenonium is known to be an inhibitor of acetylcholinesterase, and recent data have shown this drug to antagonize muscarinic receptors as well. This latter property was confirmed by Schild analyses of ambenonium-induced blockade of responses to bethanechol in guinea-pig ileal longitudinal smooth muscle, taenia caeci, trachea and rat anococcygeus muscle. Statistical analysis showed ambenonium to be a simple competitive antagonist of responses to bethanechol in these tissues with pKB values in each tissue not significantly different from each other (mean pKB = 6.0). However, considerable variability in pKB estimates was encountered when ambenonium was utilized to block responses to acetylcholine. Ambenonium was a less potent antagonist of tissue responses to acetylcholine, and the underestimation in the pKB (as compared to that obtained with bethanechol) could be eliminated by prior treatment of tissues with the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor neostigmine. These data suggested that ambenonium had a dual effect on tissue responses to acetylcholine-producing potentiation by blockade of acetylcholinesterase and concomitant antagonism by blockade of muscarinic receptors. The Schild regressions obtained for ambenonium antagonism of acetylcholine responses formally satisfied criteria for simple competitive antagonism of a homogenous population of receptors (linear regression, slope equal to unity). The fact that these regressions yielded erroneous apparent pKB values suggests how two properties of a drug in one molecule could provide misleading information about drug receptors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",

        "title": "Neuroimaging of histamine H1-receptor occupancy in human brain by positron emission tomography (PET): a comparative study of ebastine, a second-generation antihistamine, and (+)-chlorpheniramine, a classical antihistamine.",
        "abstract": "AIMS: Sedation induced by antihistamines is widely recognized to be caused by their penetration through the blood-brain-barrier and the consequent occupation of brain histamine H1-receptors. We previously studied the mechanism of sedation caused by antihistamines using positron emission tomography (PET). Recently, we revealed the nonsedative characteristic of ebastine, a second-generation antihistamine, with cognitive performance tests. In the present study, H1-receptor occupation by ebastine was examined in the human brain using PET. METHODS: Ebastine 10 mg and (+)-chlorpheniramine 2 or 6 mg were orally given to healthy male volunteers. PET scans with [11C]-doxepin, a potent H1-receptor antagonist, were conducted near tmax of respective drugs. Other volunteers in the control group also received PET scans. The binding potential of doxepin (BP = Bmax/Kd) for available brain H1-receptors was imaged on a voxel-by-voxel basis through graphical analysis. By setting regions of interest, the H1-receptor occupancy of drugs was calculated in several H1-receptor rich regions. RESULTS: Brain distribution of radioactivity after ebastine treatment was similar to that without any drugs. However, after the oral administration of 2 mg (+)-chlorpheniramine, the level was lower than after ebastine and nondrug treatments. Graphical analysis followed by statistical parametric mapping (SPM96) revealed that H1-receptor rich regions such as cortices, cingulate gyrus and thalamus were regions where the BPs after ebastine were significantly higher than after (+)-chlorpheniramine (2 mg). H1-receptor occupancies in cortex were approximately 10% by ebastine and &gt; or = 50% by either dose of (+)-chlorpheniramine (95% confidence interval for difference in the mean receptor occupancies: 27%, 54% for 2 mg and 35%, 62% for 6 mg vs ebastine, respectively). Receptor occupancies increased with increasing plasma concentration of (+)-chlorpheniramine, but not with concentration of carebastine, an active metabolite of ebastine. CONCLUSIONS: Ebastine (10 mg orally) causes brain histamine H1-receptor occupation of approximately 10%, consistent with its lower incidence of sedative effect, whereas (+)-chlorpheniramine occupied about 50% of brain H1-receptors even at a low but sedative dose of 2 mg; occupancy of (+)-chlorpheniramine was correlated with plasma (+)-chlorpheniramine concentration.",

        "title": "Overview of the angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors.",
        "abstract": "The pharmacology of angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and their role in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS) are described, and pharmacokinetic properties and common adverse events are presented. ACE inhibitors play a vital role in the RAS by regulating the potent vasoconstrictor angiotensin II. All ACE inhibitors share the same basic structure; however, they can be separated on the basis of their functional (binding) group: carboxyl, sulfhydryl, or phosphinyl. These functional groups are, in part, responsible for differences in the pharmacokinetic and safety profiles of these agents. Captopril and lisinopril are the only ACE inhibitors that are not prodrugs requiring activation through hepatic biotransformation. Differences among the ACE inhibitors in lipophilicity are described; fosinopril has the greatest lipophilicity and lisinopril the least. ACE is found in numerous tissues, and there is increasing evidence of differences among ACE inhibitors in their ability to inhibit tissue ACE. Most ACE inhibitors are eliminated mainly by the kidneys and to a lesser extent through the liver. Lisinopril is the only ACE inhibitor that does not require hepatic metabolism. In the selection of an ACE inhibitor for once-daily use to treat hypertension, differences in trough-peak ratios are clinically relevant. Fosinopril, ramipril, and trandolapril have minimum trough-peak ratios of 50% or greater. ACE inhibitors are generally well tolerated, with hypotension, cough, and hyperkalemia being the most frequently reported adverse effects for the entire class. Drug interactions across the ACE inhibitor class as well as agent-specific interactions are described. Factors to be considered in the selection of an ACE inhibitor include differences in potency, affinity for ACE, pharmacokinetics, and toxicity that are related to structural properties of the drug; whether the trough-peak ratio enables use of a once-daily dose; and potential adverse effects related to a drug's functional (binding) group.",

        "abstract": "The effect of four slow Ca2+ channel blockers (felodipine, nifedipine, prenylamine and bepridil) that possess the ability to bind to calmodulin (CaM) section and to inhibit myosin light chain kinase (MLCK) on CaM-regulated Ca2+ pumping ATPase of cardiac sarcolemma (SL) and brain cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase (PDE) was studied. The ability of these drugs to inhibit Ca2+ pumping ATPase correlated with their inhibitory effect on CaM-activated Ca2+-dependent PDE. Nifedipine was unable to inhibit markedly both enzymes. Prenylamine also was a weak inhibitor, which was unexpected because of its CaM binding potency. Felodipine (10-50 microM) and bepridil (50 microM) markedly reduced activities of SL Ca2+ pumping ATPase and PDE. Striking differences were, however, demonstrated when Ca2+ and CaM concentrations, respectively, were increased. Previously it was reported that inhibition of the SL Ca2+ pumping ATPase by the CaM antagonist calmidazolium could be overcome by increasing Ca2+ concentrations (J. M. J. Lamers and J. T. Stinis, Cell Calcium 4, 281-294, 1983). Felodipine (10-50 microM) in the present study, appeared to be equipotent with calmidazolium in reducing Ca2+ pumping ATPase, but increasing Ca2+ up to 12.2 microM could not counteract this effect. Felodipine (2-10 microM) also inhibited brain PDE noncompetitively with respect to CaM contrary to the competitive effectors calmidazolium and bepridil. On the other hand, bepridil (10-20 microM) decreased or increased Ca2+ pumping ATPase activity depending on the Ca2+ concentration (0.29 and 12.2 microM, respectively) used. These findings suggest at least two types of CaM antagonists, which can be discriminated on basis of their inhibition patterns of PDE and heart SL Ca2+ pumping ATPase.",

        "abstract": "A novel method employing high-performance liquid chromatograph-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) has been developed and validated for the quantitation of plasma 2'-deoxyuridine (UdR). It involves a plasma clean-up step with strong anion-exchange solid-phase extraction (SAX-SPE) followed by HPLC separation and atmospheric pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometry detection (APCI-MS) in a selected-ion monitoring (SIM) mode. The ionization conditions were optimised in negative ion mode to give the best intensity of the dominant formate adduct [M+HCOO]- at m/z 273. Retention times were 7.5 and 12.5 min for 2'-deoxyuridine and 5-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine, an iodinated analogue internal standard (IS), respectively. Peak area ratios of 2'-deoxyuridine to IS were used for regression analysis of the calibration curve. The latter was linear from 5 to 400 nmol/l using 1 ml sample volume of plasma. The average recovery was 81.5% and 78.6% for 2'-deoxyuridine and 5-iodo-deoxyuridine, respectively. The method provides sufficient sensitivity, precision, accuracy and selectivity for routine analysis of human plasma 2'-deoxyuridine concentration with the lowest limit of quantitation (LLOQ) of 5 nmol/l. Clinical studies in cancer patients treated with the new fluoropyrimidine analogue capecitabine (N4-pentoxycarbonyl-5'-5-fluorocytidine) have shown that plasma 2'-deoxyuridine was significantly elevated after 1 week of treatment, consistent with inhibition of thymidylate synthase (TS). These findings suggest that the mechanism of antiproliferative toxicity of capecitabine is at least partly due to TS inhibitory activity of its active metabolite 5-fluoro-2'-deoxyuridine monophosphate (FdUMP). Monitoring of plasma UdR concentrations have the potential to help clinicians to guide scheduling of capecitabine or other TS inhibitors in clinical trials. Marked differences of plasma 2'-deoxyuridine between human and rodents have also been confirmed. In conclusion, the LC-MS method developed is simple, highly selective and sensitive and permits pharmacodynamic studies of TS inhibitors in several species.",

The enzyme lanosterol 14 alpha-demethylase (Erg11) is the target for azole antifungals. We cloned PCERG11 and compared its sequence to Erg11 proteins present in azole-resistant organisms, and performed chromosomal and Northern blot analysis for PCERG11. Of 13 potential sites which could confer resistance to azoles, two were identical to azole-resistant Candida. By site-directed mutagenesis we changed these two sites in PCERG11 to those present in azole-sensitive Candida to generate PCERG11-SDM (E113D, T125K). We tested the susceptibility of ERG11 deletion strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (SC) expressing PCERG11, PCERG11-SDM, and wild-type SCERG11 to three azole antifungals: fluconazole, itraconazole, and voriconazole. PCERG11 required a 2.2-fold higher dose of voriconazole and 3.5-fold higher dose of fluconazole than SCERG11 for a 50% reduction in growth. No difference was observed in the sensitivity to itraconazole. PCERG11-SDM has increased sensitivity to fluconazole and voriconazole, but not itraconazole. We believe that the molecular structure of the lanosterol 14 alpha-demethylase encoded by PCERG11 confers inherent resistance to azole antifungals and plays an integral part in the overall resistance of this PC to azole therapy.",

        "abstract": "Amitriptyline, a non-selective noradrenaline (NA) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) reuptake inhibitor, has recently been demonstrated to produce a peripheral antinociceptive action in an inflammatory (formalin test) and a neuropathic pain model (spinal nerve ligation). In the present study, we determined whether desipramine, a selective NA reuptake inhibitor, and fluoxetine, a selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitor, could produce peripheral antinociceptive actions in these same tests. Effects on paw volume also were determined. In the 2.5% formalin test, desipramine and fluoxetine 10-300 nmol produced a dose-related reduction in phase 2 (16-60 min) flinching and biting/licking behaviours when coadministered with the formalin. Phase 1 flinch behaviours (0-12 min) were significantly reduced at the highest dose. These actions are peripherally mediated, as they were not seen when desipramine or fluoxetine (100, 300 nmol) were injected into the contralateral hindpaw. The peripheral action of desipramine and fluoxetine was not altered by coadministration of caffeine 1500 nmol. In the spinal nerve ligation model, desipramine 100 nmol, but not fluoxetine 100 nmol, produced a peripheral anti-hyperalgesic action in the hindpaw corresponding to the ligated side when thresholds were determined using a thermal paw stimulator. In paw volume experiments, desipramine, at doses which are maximally effective in behavioural tests, produced only a slight increase in paw volume, but fluoxetine (10-300 nmol) produced a robust and sustained dose-related increase in paw volume. Amitriptyline also produced minimal effects on paw volume. When coinjected with formalin, no agent significantly altered the degree of paw swelling produced by formalin. The increase in paw volume produced by fluoxetine was inhibited by ketanserin (5-HT2 receptor antagonist), mepyramine (histamine H1 receptor antagonist) and phentolamine (alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonist), but not by the other selective 5-HT receptor antagonists tested or caffeine. The pronounced peripheral pain alleviating actions in the absence of marked changes in paw volume produced by desipramine and amitriptyline, but not fluoxetine, in the formalin test and the spinal nerve ligation model suggest that these agents could be developed as cream or gel formulations to recruit a peripheral antinociceptive action in inflammatory and neuropathic pain states. Such a formulation might permit the attainment of higher and more efficacious concentrations in the region of the sensory nerve terminal, with limited systemic side effects.",

The cell line was grown in RPMI supplemented with 2.5% charcoal-stripped FBS for 72 hr. The IC(50) of tamoxifen and bicalutamide and the optimal stimulatory concentrations of 17beta-estradiol and dihydrotestosterone were determined by means of the cell-viability assay, the activity of telomerase was measured by the telomere repeat amplification protocol (TRAP) and the expression of proteins was analysed by the Western blot technique. 17beta-estradiol stimulated cell growth more effectively than dihydrotestosterone whereas hormone antagonists tamoxifen and bicalutamide caused a significant decrease in cell viability. The treatment of cells by a combination of low doses of 17 beta-estradiol and dihydrotestosterone stimulated cells stronger than treatment by a single hormone. Only 17beta-estradiol, in concentration of 10nM, increased strongly the expression of p21(Waf1/Cip1) and increased slightly telomerase activity in the LNCaP cells. 50 microM of bicalutamide down-regulated the levels of the androgen receptor, the proliferating cell nuclear antigen and telomerase activity, and up-regulated the expression of p27(Kip1). We hereby describe the first observation of the influence of bicalutamide on telomerase activity and a positive correlation between the effect of 17beta-estradiol and the induction of both the endogenous cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, p21(Waf1/Cip1), and telomerase activity in a prostatic cancer cell line LNCaP.

We administered mu-opioid receptor agonists and antagonists to adult male Sprague-Dawley rats prior to treatment with the phenethylamine hallucinogen 1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane (DOI), which is known to induce head shakes via 5-HT2A receptors. The suppressant action of the moderately selective mu-opioid receptor agonist, buprenorphine (ID50 approximately 0.005 mg/kg, i.p.; a mu-opioid receptor partial agonist and kappa-opioid receptor antagonist) was blocked by naloxone and pretreatment with the irreversible mu-opioid receptor antagonist clocinnamox. Another mu-opioid receptor agonist fentanyl also suppressed DOI-induced head shakes. In contrast, a delta-opioid receptor agonist was without effect on DOI-induced head shakes. Thus, activation of mu-opioid receptors can suppress head shakes induced by hallucinogenic drugs.",

        "abstract": "Fulvestrant (Faslodex) is a novel estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist that competitively binds to the ER with a much greater affinity than that of tamoxifen. The downregulation of cellular levels of the ER protein results in complete abrogation of estrogen-sensitive gene transcription. This distinct mechanism of action ensures a lack of cross resistance with other hormonal agents and, in contrast to tamoxifen, fulvestrant has no known estrogen-agonist effects. Fulvestrant is administered via monthly intramuscular injections (250mg) and is recommended for the treatment of hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer in postmenopausal women with disease progression following antiestrogen therapy. The efficacy of fulvestrant was similar to that of the aromatase inhibitor anastrozole (1 mg/day) in two, well designed studies in postmenopausal women with locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer that had progressed during prior antiestrogen therapy. Time to disease progression (primary endpoint) and treatment failure, rates of objective response and clinical benefit, overall survival and quality of life were similar in patients treated with fulvestrant or anastrozole. In retrospective noninferiority analyses, fulvestrant was at least as effective as anastrozole in all randomised patients, and in those with or without visceral metastases. Fulvestrant is generally well tolerated and was tolerated as well as anastrozole in clinical trials. Treatment-related adverse events were mostly mild to moderate and led to treatment withdrawal in about 1% of patients who received fulvestrant or anastrozole. The main adverse effects associated with therapy are nausea, asthenia, pain, vasodilation and headache.In conclusion, monthly intramuscular injections of fulvestrant are at least as effective and as well tolerated as oral anastrozole once daily in the treatment of postmenopausal women with advanced breast cancer that has progressed on prior antiestrogen therapy. Because of a different mode of action to that of other hormonal agents, fulvestrant is effective in the treatment of tamoxifen-resistant disease and, unlike tamoxifen, has no known estrogen agonist effects. Thus, fulvestrant provides an effective and well tolerated option for the treatment of hormone receptor-positive metastatic breast cancer in postmenopausal women with disease progression following antiestrogen therapy.",

        "abstract": "Topical carbonic anhydrase inhibitors are a novel addition to the armamentarium of medical glaucoma treatment; dorzolamide has been available since 1995 and brinzolamide since 1998. They lower intraocular pressure by inhibiting carbonic anhydrase, a key enzyme for aqueous humor formation. Intraocular pressure-lowering activity of the substances appears to be the same and is similar to that of most other agents, but it does not reach the activity of the unselective beta-blocker timolol or the prostaglandin latanoprost. On concomitant treatment, additivity is reached with all other topical agents. A possible improvement of blood flow may offer an additional benefit, but its significance for the long-term outcome for human glaucoma remains to be shown. Side effects are mostly local. A more physiologic pH of brinzolamide appears to be advantageous.",

The kinetic evaluation of the process was performed in a step-by-step analysis. The second order overall sulfonylation rate constants, determined from classical residual activity measurements, were used in the subsequent analysis of progress curves. The latter were obtained by measuring the hydrolysis of acetylthiocholine in a complex reaction system of enzyme, substrate, irreversible and reversible inhibitor. The underlying kinetic mechanisms, from such a complex data, could only be untangled by targeted inspection and successive incorporation of reaction steps for which experimental evidence existed. The study showed that the peripheral ligand D-tubocurarine, by binding at the entrance into the active site of the two investigated enzymes (Golicnik et al., Biochemistry 40 (2001) 1214), enhances the affinity for small methanesulfonylfluoride, rather to speeding up the formation of a stable covalent enzyme-inhibitor complex. The specific arrangements at the rim of the active site of each individual enzyme dictate the actual events which can be detected by kinetic means.",

We have also determined the structure of its complex with a drug used for glaucoma therapy, the sulfonamide inhibitor brinzolamide (Azopt). The overall structure of murine CAIV is generally similar to that of human CAIV; however, some local structural differences are found in the active site resulting from amino acid sequence differences in the \"130's segment\" and the residue-63 loop (these may affect the nearby catalytic proton shuttle, His-64). Similar to human CAIV, the C-terminus of murine CAIV is surrounded by a substantial electropositive surface potential that may stabilize the interaction with the phospholipid membrane.

        "title": "Carvedilol selectively inhibits oscillatory intracellular calcium changes evoked by human alpha1D- and alpha1B-adrenergic receptors.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence from clinical trials indicates that carvedilol, an antagonist of alpha1- and beta-adrenergic receptors (ARs), provides an effective treatment for chronic heart failure, whereas nonselective alpha1-AR blockade has an adverse outcome in this disease. It is, however, not clear whether carvedilol exhibits a subtype-dependent impact on three distinct alpha1-adrenergic receptors (alpha1-ARs). METHODS AND RESULTS: We determined binding properties of human ARs for carvedilol using HEK293 human embryonic kidney cells expressing a single AR subtype. Our results showed that the affinities of alpha1D-AR and alpha1B-AR for carvedilol are higher than that of the beta1-AR subtype, a major target in heart failure treatment. The affinity rank order and pKi values of ARs for carvedilol were as follows: alpha1D-AR (8.9)&gt;alpha1B-AR (8.6)&gt;beta1-AR (8.4)&gt;beta2-AR (8.0)&gt;alpha1A-AR (7.9)?alpha2C-AR (5.9)&gt;alpha2B-AR (5.5)&gt;alpha2A-AR (5.3). Furthermore, temporal kinetics of intracellular calcium signaling mediated via alpha1D- and alpha1B-ARs, but not via alpha1A-AR (P&lt;0.01), showed oscillatory patterns with frequencies ranging from 0.3 to 3 per minute in human smooth muscle and HEK293 cells, which were inhibited by the therapeutic concentrations of carvedilol (10 nM) in a subtype-dependent manner. When oscillatory alpha1B-AR and non-oscillatory alpha1A-AR were co-expressed and heteromer receptors were detected with bioluminescence resonance energy transfer and co-immunoprecipitation, carvedilol suppressed only oscillatory component of global cytosolic free calcium change. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate that in addition to beta-ARs, receptor inhibition by carvedilol is directed to alpha1-ARs, preferably to alpha1D- and alpha1B-AR-mediated signaling events, including intracellular calcium oscillations in vascular smooth muscle.",

        "abstract": "Expression of drug-resistant forms of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) in hematopoietic cells confers substantial resistance of animals to antifolate administration. In this study, we tested whether the chemoprotection conferred by expression of the tyrosine-22 variant DHFR could be used for more effective therapy of the 32Dp210 murine model of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML). Administration of the maximum tolerated dose of trimetrexate (TMTX) with the nucleoside transport inhibitor prodrug nitrobenzylmercaptopurine ribose-5'-monophosphate (NBMPR-P) inhibited 32Dp210 tumor progression in mice engrafted with transgenic tyrosine-22 DHFR marrow and improved survival of tumor-bearing animals as long as drug administration was continued. NBMPR-P coadministration was necessary for maximal tumor inhibition, as administration of TMTX alone delayed but did not prevent tumor progression. The chemoprotection afforded by engraftment with transgenic tyrosine-22 DHFR marrow was necessary for effective chemotherapy, as normal mice lacking transgenic marrow could not tolerate the higher TMTX dose (60 mg/kg/day) administered to mice with transgenic marrow, and the decreased dose of TMTX with NBMPR-P tolerated by normal tumor-bearing animals did not inhibit tumor progression or improve animal survival. We conclude that TMTX with NBMPR-P inhibits tumor progression in the 32Dp210 model of CML in animals engrafted with drug-resistant tyrosine-22 DHFR transgenic marrow, and that based on this model the introduction of a drug-resistant DHFR gene into marrow combined with TMTX and NBMPR-P administration may provide an effective treatment for CML.",

        "abstract": "Ketoconazole is an antifungal agent that, in high doses, inhibits testicular and adrenal steroid synthesis. The ability of ketoconazole to block steroid synthesis has prompted us to use it in the treatment of advanced prostatic carcinoma. This study was designed to determine the site of steroid synthetic blockade that was induced by ketoconazole. Twelve patients with metastatic prostate carcinoma on long term high dose ketoconazole therapy were compared with 12 control volunteers. Values of serum progesterone, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, androstenedione, dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate, testosterone, and cortisol were measured in a baseline state and after Cosyntropin and human chorionic gonadotropin stimulation. Baseline data showed that serum levels of testosterone, androstenedione, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate were lower and that plasma progesterone, luteinizing hormone, and adrenocorticotropin were higher in the ketoconazole group. With Cosyntropin, plasma cortisol, androstenedione, and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate increased only in the control group. With human chorionic gonadotropin, testosterone increased only in the control group. Basal 17-hydroxyprogesterone and progesterone rose after Cosyntropin only in the ketoconazole group. Following human chorionic gonadotropin, progesterone rose in the ketoconazole group but not in the control group. These results suggest that ketoconazole is a potent inhibitor of steroid synthesis. The major site of action appears to be in the inhibition of 17-20 desmolase. A moderate blockade of 17-hydroxylase may be present. There is a marked inhibition of 21- and/or 11-hydroxylase. The ability of ketoconazole to inhibit steroid synthesis should have therapeutic potential in the treatment of steroid dependent disease. Frequent high dose ketoconazole therapy can inhibit adrenal steroid synthesis, which can be important for patients undergoing stressful situations.",

        "abstract": "Binding of dopamine receptor ligands to human D2 and D3 receptors was characterized in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells using the dopamine D2 receptor antagonist [125I] iodosulpiride. Only limited binding selectivity was observed for known dopamine D2 receptor antagonists from a variety of chemical classes, which included haloperidol, chlorpromazine, sulpiride, pimozide and cis flupenthixol. The most selective compound from this group were (+)butaclamol and domperidone which showed 5-fold D3 selectivity. A number of high affinity dopamine receptor agonists, including apomorphine and bromocriptine, also failed to demonstrate selectivity. In contrast, the natural ligand dopamine and the efficacious synthetic agonists quinpirole, (+)4-propyl-9-hydroxynapthoxazine (PHNO), 2-amino-6,7-dihydroxy-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalene (6,7-ADTN), 7-OH DPAT and N-0434 showed marked apparent human dopamine D3 (hD3) receptor selectivity. In the aminotetralin series, this selectivity was observed preferentially with analogs of the 6,7-rotamer compared with compounds from the 5,6-rotamer series. Functional coupling of the hD3 receptor was investigated in a number of cell lines in which the hD3 receptor was stably expressed, including CHO cells, the neuroblastoma-glioma hybrid cell line NG108-15 and a rat 1 fibroblast cell line. There was no evidence of functional coupling of the hD3 receptor to adenylate cyclase, arachidonic acid release, phospholipase C activation, K+ currents or calcium mobilization in any of the cell lines examined. Furthermore, guanine nucleotides failed to inhibit the binding of [3H] N-0437 to hD3 receptors in any of the three cell lines. There may be a number of explanations for these results. These cell lines may not have the appropriate G-protein or secondary messenger systems that are coupled to the hD3 receptor in situ. Alternatively, this receptor may couple by a mechanism that is as yet undefined. The finding that a wide range of structurally diverse human dopamine D2 (hD2) receptor agonists have an apparent hD3 selectivity may imply that the hD3 receptor exists predominantly in a high affinity state.",

        "abstract": "Activation of G protein-coupled receptors like the beta(1)-adrenergic receptor results in conformational changes that ultimately lead to signal propagation through a G protein to an effector like adenylyl cyclase. In this study we identified amino acids that seem to be critical for activation of the human beta(1)-adrenergic receptor. Activation patterns of mutant receptors were analyzed using two structurally different ligands for beta-adrenergic receptors that both are mixed agonist/antagonists. Broxaterol and terbutaline are agonists at beta(2)- and beta(3)-receptors; however, they act as antagonists at the beta(1)-subtype. We reasoned that this functional selectivity may be reflected by a corresponding sequence pattern in the receptor subtypes. Therefore, we exchanged single amino acids of the beta(1)-adrenergic receptor for residues that were identical in the beta(2)- and beta(3)-subtypes but different in the beta(1)-receptor. Pharmacological characterization of such receptor mutants revealed that binding of a panel of agonists and antagonists including broxaterol and terbutaline was unaltered. However, two of the mutants (I185V and D212N) were activated by broxaterol and terbutaline, which acted as antagonists at the wild-type receptor. Two additional mutants (V120L and K253R) could be activated by terbutaline alone, which is structurally more closely related to endogenous catecholamines like epinephrine than to broxaterol. A model of the human beta(1)-adrenergic receptor showed that the four gain-of-function mutations are outside of the putative ligand-binding domain substantiating the lack of an effect of the mutations on binding characteristics. These results support the notion that Val-120, Ile-185, Asp-212, and Lys-253 are critically involved in conformational changes occurring during receptor activation.",

In the series of diazine analogues of Ridogrel (1), replacement of the 3-pyridyl group by a 2-pyrazinyl, 4-pyridazinyl, or 5-pyrimidinyl moiety led to compounds that inhibit thromboxane A2 synthetase in gel-filtered human platelets comparable to 1 (IC50 of 0.006, 0.016, and 0.039 microM, respectively, versus 0.007 microM).

Complement activation is thus not checked and causes destruction of these cells. Eculizumab is a monoclonal antibody treatment which specifically binds to the complement protein C5, preventing its cleavage, and so halts the complement cascade and prevents the formation of the terminal complement proteins. Eculizumab prevents intravascular hemolysis, stabilizes hemoglobin levels, reduces or stops the need for blood transfusions, and improves fatigue and patient quality of life as well as reducing pulmonary hypertension, decreasing the risk of thrombosis and protecting against worsening renal function.

        "abstract": "GST pi, the main glutathione S-transferase isoform present in the human brain, was isolated from various regions of the brain and the in vitro effect of tricyclic antidepressants on its activity was studied. The results indicated that amitripyline and doxepin--derivatives of dibenzcycloheptadiene, as well as imipramine and clomipramine--derivatives of dibenzazepine, inhibit the activity of GST pi from frontal and parietal cortex, hippocampus and brain stem. All these tricyclics are noncompetitive inhibitors of the enzyme with respect to reduced glutathione and noncompetitive (amitripyline, doxepin) or uncompetitive (imipramine, clomipramine) with respect to the electrophilic substrate. Their inhibitory effect is reversible and it depends on the chemical structure of the tricyclic antidepressants rather than on the brain localization of the enzyme. We conclude that the interaction between GST pi and the drugs may reduce their availability in the brain and thus affect their therapeutic activity. On the other hand, tricyclic antidepressants may decrease the efficiency of the enzymatic barrier formed by GST and increase the exposure of brain to toxic electrophiles. Reactive electrophiles not inactivated by GST may contribute in adverse effects caused by these drugs.",

It has been claimed that partial agonism of the dopamine D(2) and 5-HT(1A) receptors and antagonism of the 5-HT(2) receptor contribute to the clinical profile of aripiprazole, a so-called dopamine- and 5-HT stabiliser. However, recent studies have questioned the role of the 5-HT-mediated systems in the mechanism of action of aripiprazole. This report reviews published and unpublished data that suggest that aripiprazole acts as a selective partial agonist at the dopamine D(2) receptor and does not affect 5-HT receptors at therapeutic doses.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Aspirin, by nonselectively blocking cyclooxygenase both in platelets and in endothelial cells, not only inhibits the thromboxane A2 pathway of platelet activation but at the same time also the generation of vasodilating and platelet-inhibitory prostanoids, such as prostacyclin, by the endothelial cells. Ridogrel, by inhibiting thromboxane A2 synthase and blocking the thromboxane A2/prostaglandin endoperoxide receptors, is a more potent antiplatelet agent than aspirin and might offer an advantage over aspirin as an adjunct to thrombolysis. This study was performed to compare the efficacy and safety of ridogrel with that of aspirin as conjunctive therapy for thrombolysis in patients with acute myocardial infarction. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 907 patients with acute myocardial infarction were randomized between aspirin and ridogrel given in addition to streptokinase (1.5 MU over a period of 1 hour). The primary end point was coronary patency (TIMI flow grades 2 and 3) at predischarge angiography to be performed between 7 and 14 days after admission. A patent infarct-related vessel was found in similar proportions of patients in the two treatment groups: 72.2% in the ridogrel and 75.5% in the aspirin group. The presence of clinical markers of reperfusion at 2 hours and the incidence of major clinical events during hospital stay were also similar in both groups. However, in a post hoc analysis, a lower incidence of new ischemic events (reinfarction, recurrent angina, ischemic stroke) was observed with ridogrel: 13% versus 19% in the aspirin group (a 32% reduction; P &lt; .025). No excess of serious bleeding complications, including hemorrhagic stroke, was found. CONCLUSIONS: Ridogrel is not superior to aspirin in enhancing the fibrinolytic efficacy of streptokinase but might be more effective in preventing new ischemic events.",

METHODS: We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, multicenter, phase 3 trial. Patients received either placebo or eculizumab intravenously; eculizumab was given at a dose of 600 mg weekly for 4 weeks, followed 1 week later by a 900-mg dose and then 900 mg every other week through week 26. The two primary end points were the stabilization of hemoglobin levels and the number of units of packed red cells transfused. Biochemical indicators of intravascular hemolysis and the patients' quality of life were also assessed. RESULTS: Eighty-seven patients underwent randomization. Stabilization of hemoglobin levels in the absence of transfusions was achieved in 49% (21 of 43) of the patients assigned to eculizumab and none (0 of 44) of those assigned to placebo (P&lt;0.001). During the study, a median of 0 units of packed red cells was administered in the eculizumab group, as compared with 10 units in the placebo group (P&lt;0.001). Eculizumab reduced intravascular hemolysis, as shown by the 85.8% lower median area under the curve for lactate dehydrogenase plotted against time (in days) in the eculizumab group, as compared with the placebo group (58,587 vs. 411,822 U per liter; P&lt;0.001). Clinically significant improvements were also found in the quality of life, as measured by scores on the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-Fatigue instrument (P&lt;0.001) and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire. Of the 87 patients, 4 in the eculizumab group and 9 in the placebo group had serious adverse events, none of which were considered to be treatment-related; all these patients recovered without sequelae.

Dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and estrone sulfotransferase activities were strongly inhibited by a number of compounds, with IC50 values ranging between 440 pM and 147 microM. For DHEA sulfotransferase, clomiphene, testosterone, danazol and spironolactone were the best inhibitors, with IC50 values less than 5 microM, whereas for estrone sulfotransferase cyclizine, ibuprofen, chlorpheniramine and dimenhydrinate resulted in the strongest inhibition, again with IC50 values of less than 5 microM. The xenobiotic substrate 1-naphthol was refractory to substantial inhibition, with the exception of clomiphene. The majority of the drugs which inhibited steroid ST activities strongly were either synthetic steroids, antisteroidals or were tertiary amine drugs such as tricyclic antidepressants and antihistamines, many of which exhibit adverse side effects manifesting particularly as sexual dysfunction and disruption of hormone action in clinical use. The importance of these findings for our understanding of the molecular basis of adverse drug reactions is discussed.",

OBJECTIVES: This study was undertaken to asses the hypotensive effect of a dual ACE/NEP inhibitor (omapatrilat) in comparison to a NEP inhibitor (candoxatril) and ACE inhibitor (enalapril) in SHRS. METHODS: The study was performed in 130 male spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRS) that were divided into 4 groups and treated orally by a gastric tube for 14 days according to the following dosage regimen: omapatrilat (40 mg/kg b.w./24 h); candoxatril (30 mg/kg b.w./24 h); enalapril (20 mg/kg b.w./ 24 h) and control (water). Systolic blood pressure values were determined at the beginning of the study by the tail-cuff pletysmographic method, at the 7th and 14th day of the treatment, as well as 14 days after the end of the drug administration. For evaluation of the effect of omapatrilat, candoxatril and enalapril on the investigated parameters (plasma atrial natriuretic peptide and serum ACE), 10 animals from the control group were sacrificed at the beginning of the study, and afterwards 10 animals from each group were also sacrificed on the 7th and 14th day of the treatment, as well as 14 days after the end of the drug administration (28th day). RESULTS: The dual ACE/NEP inhibitor, omapatrilat and the ACE inhibitor, enalapril lowered SBP more effectively than the NEP inhibitor, candoxatril at all time points of the experiment (p &lt; 0.01). Omapatrilat was slightly more effective than the enalapril treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Two-week treatment with the dual ACE/NEP inhibitor omapatrilat caused a significant decrease of the SBP, inhibition of the serum ACE activity and increase of the plasma ANP values, and therefore it should be considered as a new potential therapeutic agent in blood pressure management (Tab. 3, Fig. 2, Ref. 20).",

        "abstract": "Aripiprazole, a quinolinone derivative, is a new dopaminergic agent which has been recently developed and demonstrated to be clinically useful as an antipsychotic drug with reduced extrapyramidal motor side effects. Here, we found that aripiprazole competed [3H]spiperone binding with a 100-fold higher affinity than [3H]SCH23390 binding, and inhibited the quinpirole-induced facilitation of high-affinity GTPase activity in rat striatal membranes. The effects of chronic administration of aripiprazole and haloperidol on dopamine D2 receptor binding and mRNA level in rat striata were examined by a [3H]spiperone binding assay and a ribonuclease protection assay. Haloperidol induced a significant rise in Bmax of [3H]spiperone binding at 1 mg/kg and in the level of dopamine D2L receptor mRNA at 4 mg/kg. A high dose of aripiprazole (100 mg/kg) only tended to increase the Bmax of [3H]spiperone binding non-significantly, and had no effect on the level of dopamine D2L receptor mRNA. These results indicated that aripiprazole had an antagonistic activity to dopamine D2 receptors with a high affinity, but that the potency of aripiprazole to up-regulate dopamine D2 receptors in the striatum was much smaller than that of haloperidol. This small up-regulation may be related to the ability to aripiprazole to act without side effects including tardive dyskinesia.",

TMC114 exhibited potent anti-HIV activity with a 50% effective concentration (EC50) of 1 to 5 nM and a 90% effective concentration of 2.7 to 13 nM. TMC114 exhibited no cytotoxicity at concentrations up to 100 muM (selectivity index, &gt;20,000). All viruses in a panel of 19 recombinant clinical isolates carrying multiple protease mutations and demonstrating resistance to an average of five other PIs, were susceptible to TMC114, defined as a fold change in EC50 of &lt;4. TMC114 was also effective against the majority of 1,501 PI-resistant recombinant viruses derived from recent clinical samples, with EC50s of &lt;10 nM for 75% of the samples. In sequential passage experiments using HIV-1 LAI, two mutations (R41T and K70E) were selected. One selected virus showed a 10-fold reduction in susceptibility to TMC114, but &lt;10-fold reductions in susceptibility to the current PIs (atazanavir was not assessed), except saquinavir. However, when the selected mutations were introduced into a laboratory strain by site-directed mutagenesis, they had no effect on susceptibility to TMC114 or other PIs. There was no evidence of antagonism between TMC114 and any currently available PIs or reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Combinations with ritonavir, nelfinavir, and amprenavir showed some evidence of synergy. These results suggest that TMC114 is a potential candidate for the treatment of both naive and PI-experienced patients with HIV.",

METHODS: The effect of budesonide (100 pM to 10 microM) on VEGF secretion, expression of VEGF mRNA, and cytotoxicity were determined in ARPE-19 cells by ELISA, RT-PCR, and a cell-viability assay, respectively. To determine the involvement of glucocorticoid receptor in the observed effects of budesonide, secretion and mRNA expression studies were also performed in the presence of a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist (RU486). DL-Polylactide (PLA) nano- and microparticles containing budesonide were prepared by a solvent evaporation technique, and the particles were characterized for size, morphology, encapsulation efficiency, and in vitro release. Budesonide-PLA nano- and microparticles were administered subconjunctivally to one eye of Sprague-Dawley rats and drug levels in the retina, vitreous, lens, and cornea of both eyes were determined at the end of 1, 7, and 14 days. RESULTS: At concentrations devoid of cytotoxicity, budesonide inhibited VEGF secretion as well as mRNA expression in ARPE-19 cells in a dose-dependent manner. RU486 treatment prevented budesonide-mediated inhibition of VEGF secretion and VEGF mRNA expression. Budesonide-PLA nano- (345 nm) and microparticles (3.6 microm), with an encapsulation efficiency of 65% and 99%, respectively, sustained budesonide release in vitro. After subconjunctival administration, both budesonide-PLA nano- and microparticles produced sustained budesonide levels in the retina and other ocular tissues. CONCLUSIONS: Budesonide is capable of inhibiting VEGF expression through glucocorticoid receptor activity.

To elucidate the mechanism of amoxicillin resistance of H. pylori, penicillin-binding proteins (PBPs) of amoxicillin-resistant strains isolated in Korea were analysed. Three PBPs (66, 63 and 60 kDa) were identified in both amoxicillin-resistant and -susceptible strains using biotinylated ampicillin, and the PBP profiles were very similar irrespective of the difference in amoxicillin susceptibility. We obtained clones with moderate resistance from an amoxicillin-susceptible strain, HPK5, by transformation with genomic DNA from an amoxicillin-resistant strain, HPA116. In a resistance-induced clone, HPO1, the affinity of PBP1 for amoxicillin was reduced. The pbp1 genes from HPA116, HPO1 and HPK5 were cloned and sequenced. The nucleotide sequences of pbp1 from HPA116 and HPO1 were almost identical, whereas that of HPK5 was quite different. Both the ORFs of HPA116 and HPO1 pbp1 have four substitutions and one insertion of amino acid residues compared with those of HPK5 and other sensitive strains. All the mutations, except one, are in the C-terminal half of the 659-amino-acid sequence containing the penicillin-binding modules. DNA fragments containing either full-length or a C-terminal half of pbp1 could transform HPK5 to have resistance, indicating that changes in the penicillin-binding core of PBP1 are involved in the amoxicillin resistance of H. pylori isolated in Korea.",

In the present study, we determined the dose-response effects of doxycycline and minocycline on cerebral MMP-9 using our mouse model with VEGF focal hyperstimulation delivered with adenoviral vector (AdVEGF) in the brain. Mice were treated with doxycycline or minocycline, respectively, at 1, 5, 10, 30, 50, or 100 mg/kg/day through drinking water for 1 week. Our results have shown that MMP-9 messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression was inhibited by doxycycline starting at 10 mg/kg/day (P&lt;0.02). Minocycline showed more potent inhibition on MMP-9 mRNA expression, starting at 1 (P&lt;0.005) and further at more than 30 (P&lt;0.001) mg/kg/day. At the enzymatic activity level, doxycycline started to suppress MMP-9 activity at 5 mg/kg/day (P&lt;0.001), while minocycline had an effect at a lower dose, 1 mg/kg/day (P&lt;0.02). The inhibition of cerebral MMP-9 mRNA and activity were highly correlated with drug levels in the brain tissue. We also assessed the potential relevant signaling pathway in vitro to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the MMP-9 inhibition by tetracyclines. In vitro, minocycline, but not doxycycline, inhibits MMP-9, at least in part, via the extracellular signaling-related kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2)-mediated pathway. This study provided the evidence that the tetracyclines inhibit stimulated cerebral MMP-9 at multiple levels and are effective at very low doses, offering great potential for therapeutic use.",

(-)-Nicotine was 15 times more effective than (+)-nicotine in releasing ACh. Since tetrodotoxin (1 microM) completely antagonized the effect of nicotinic agonists, the site of action of the nicotinic agonists studied was on the somatodendritic nicotinic receptors. The electrical field stimulation-evoked release was not affected by nicotinic agonists and antagonists, indicating that the axon terminals of cholinergic interneurons are not equipped with nicotinic receptors. This preparation proved to be useful to study the effect of nicotinic agonists on somatodendritic receptors, to determine the affinity constants of nicotinic antagonists, and to characterize these receptors. The rank order of antagonists was d-tubocurarine = mecamylamine greater than pipecuronium greater than pancuronium greater than vecuronium greater than hexamethonium; the apparent affinity constants (KD) were 1.15, 1.55, 3.06, 3.98, 13.59 and 32.88 microM, respectively. alpha-Bungarotoxin had no antagonistic activity at all. This finding indicates that nicotine and the endogenous ligand ACh act via a postsynaptic, somatodendritic nicotinic receptor that is pharmacologically similar to those located on the axon terminals of sympathetic neurons or in ganglions, but is dissimilar to those located at the postsynaptic site of the neuromuscular junction.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Pranlukast, a cysteinyl leukotriene receptor 1 (CysLTR1) antagonist, inhibits not only airway smooth muscle contraction, but also allergic inflammation. The aim of this study was to determine the mechanism of pranlukast-induced interleukin-5 (IL-5) inhibition in allergic inflammation. METHODS: Surgically resected human lung tissue was passively sensitized in vitro with mite-allergen-sensitized sera, followed by stimulation with mite allergen after pretreatment of the tissue with pranlukast, dexamethasone, or both. The IL-5 protein level in the culture medium was measured, and in situ hybridization of IL-5 and CysLTR1 mRNA was performed using lung tissues. RESULTS: Pretreatment of lung tissues with pranlukast alone significantly decreased the amount of IL-5 protein in the culture medium by 40%. The combination of pranlukast and dexamethasone synergistically enhanced this effect. Quantitative in situ hybridization with image analysis revealed abundant expression of IL-5 mRNA in eosinophils, lymphocytes, and mast cells in sensitized and allergen-stimulated lung tissues. CysLTR1 mRNA was detected in macrophages, smooth muscle cells, eosinophils, and mast cells, but was less expressed in lymphocytes. Pranlukast-induced inhibition of IL-5 mRNA expression was noted in various cells, irrespective of their CysLTR1 mRNA expression status. In addition, cysteinyl leukotrienes per se failed to upregulate the IL-5 production. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that pranlukast inhibits IL-5 synthesis via a mechanism distinct from CysLTR1 antagonism.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The aim of the present study was to describe the activity of a set of opioid drugs, including partial agonists, in a human embryonic kidney cell system stably expressing only the mouse kappa-opioid receptors. Receptor activation was assessed by measuring the inhibition of cyclic adenosine mono phosphate (cAMP) production stimulated by 5 microM forskolin. Intrinsic activities and potencies of these ligands were determined relative to the endogenous ligand dynorphin and the kappa agonist with the highest intrinsic activity that was identified in this study, fentanyl. RESULTS: Among the ligands studied naltrexone, WIN 44,441 and dezocine, were classified as antagonists, while the remaining ligands were agonists. Intrinsic activity of agonists was assessed by determining the extent of inhibition of forskolin-stimulated cAMP production. The absolute levels of inhibition of cAMP production by each ligand was used to describe the rank order of intrinsic activity of the agonists; fentanyl = lofentanil &gt; or = hydromorphone = morphine = nalorphine &gt; or = etorphine &gt; or = xorphanol &gt; or = metazocine &gt; or = SKF 10047 = cyclazocine &gt; or = butorphanol &gt; nalbuphine.

BP, cardiac function, and size were evaluated in normotensive [Sprague-Dawley (SD)], spontaneously hypertensive (SHR), and spontaneously hypertensive heart failure-prone (SHHF) rats at 6, 12, 15, and 18 mo of age and in failing SHHF. Left ventricular tissues were evaluated for secretion of bioactive TNF-alpha and inhibition of TNF-alpha secretion by phosphodiesterase inhibitors. All ventricles secreted bioactive and immunoreactive TNF-alpha, but secretion decreased with age. SHR and SHHF rats secreted more TNF-alpha than SD rats at 6 mo of age, but only failing SHHF rats secreted significantly more TNF-alpha at 18 mo. Amrinone inhibited TNF-alpha secretion in all rats and was less potent but more efficacious than RO-201724 in all strains. TNF-alpha secretion correlated with BP and left ventricular mass in 6-mo-old rats, but this relationship disappeared with age. Results suggest that hypertension and/or cardiac remodeling is associated with elevated myocardial TNF-alpha, and, although hypertension, per se, did not maintain elevated cardiac TNF-alpha levels, SHHF rats increase TNF-alpha production during the end stages of failure.",

Inhibitor concentrations to cause 50% inhibition (I50) and Hill coefficients for three enzymes, human erythrocyte acetylcholinesterase (AChE), Electrophorus electricus AChE and human plasma butyrylcholinesterase (BuChE) were measured. The results obtained were as follows. The I50 for erythrocyte AChE was similar to the I50 for eel AChE. Secondary to edrophonium, diethylparaquat, paraquat, morfamquat and monoquat showed lower I50 for AChE, and possessed higher inhibition selectivity (IS), expressed as the ratio of I50 for BuChE to I50 for erythrocyte AChE. However, diquat showed higher I50 for AChE and lower IS, similar to the other monoquaternary ammoniums. A negative correlation was observed between log [I50 for erythrocyte AChE] and log [IS], among paraquat and its derivatives, monoquaternary ammoniums and anticholinergic drugs, respectively. With respect to Hill coefficients, these inhibitors could be classified into four groups, [1] competitive inhibitors: diquat, edrophonium, choline, tetramethylammonium and trimethylphenylammonium, [2] inhibitors showing negative cooperativity: paraquat, diethylparaquat, morfamquat, d-tubocurarine, atropine, gallamine and nicotine, [3] moderate type inhibitors: monoquat, hexamethonium and decamethonium.

Inhibition of both AChE and BChE with galanthamine (80 micro M), neostigmine (3-10 micro M), O-ethylS-2-(diisopropylamino)ethyl-methylphosphono-thioate (MTP) or phospholine decreased evoked transmitter release (20-50%). 4 In AChE(-/-) NMJs, iso-OMPA pre-treatment decreased evoked release. 5 Muscarinic toxin-3 decreased evoked release in both AChE(-/-) and normal NMJs treated with low concentrations of neostigmine, galanthamine or fasciculin-1, but had no effect in normal NMJs pretreated with iso-OMPA, bambuterol, MTP and phospholine. 6 In normal and AChE(-/-) NMJs pretreatment with iso-OMPA failed to affect the time course of miniature endplate potentials and full-sized endplate potentials. 7 Overall, our results suggest that inhibition or absence of AChE increases evoked quantal release by involving muscarinic receptors (mAChRs), while BChE inhibition decreases release through direct or indirect mechanisms not involving mAChRs. BChE apparently is not implicated in limiting the duration of acetylcholine action on postsynaptic receptors, but is involved in a presynaptic modulatory step of the release process.",

One new approach yielding promising results is the use of the orally active dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors. However, every new compound for T2DM has to prove long-term safety especially on cardiovascular outcomes. OBJECTIVES: Systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects of sitagliptin and vildagliptin therapy on main efficacy parameters and safety. SELECTION CRITERIA, DATA COLLECTION, AND ANALYSIS: Randomized controlled clinical studies of at least 12 weeks' duration in T2DM. RESULTS: DPP-4 inhibitors versus placebo showed glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (A1c) improvements of 0.7% versus placebo but not compared to monotherapy with other hypoglycemic agents (0.3% in favor of controls). The overall risk profile of DPP-4 inhibitors was low, however a 34% relative risk increase (95% confidence interval 10% to 64%, P = 0.004) was noted for all-cause infection associated with sitagliptin use. No data on immune function, health-related quality of life and diabetic complications could be extracted. CONCLUSIONS: DPP-4 inhibitors have some theoretical advantages over existing therapies with oral antidiabetic compounds but should currently be restricted to individual patients. Long-term data on cardiovascular outcomes and safety are needed before widespread use of these new agents.",

        "abstract": "Leukotriene (LT) A4 hydrolase/aminopeptidase is a bifunctional zinc enzyme that catalyzes the final step in the biosynthesis of LTB4, a potent chemoattractant and immune modulating lipid mediator. Here, we report a high-resolution crystal structure of LTA4 hydrolase in complex with captopril, a classical inhibitor of the zinc peptidase angiotensin-converting enzyme. Captopril makes few interactions with the protein, but its free thiol group is bound to the zinc, apparently accounting for most of its inhibitory action on LTA4 hydrolase. In addition, we have determined the structures of LTA4 hydrolase in complex with two selective tight-binding inhibitors, a thioamine and a hydroxamic acid. Their common benzyloxyphenyl tail, designed to mimic the carbon backbone of LTA4, binds into a narrow hydrophobic cavity in the protein. The free hydroxyl group of the hydroxamic acid makes a suboptimal, monodentate complex with the zinc, and strategies for improved inhibitor design can be deduced from the structure. Taken together, the three crystal structures provide the molecular basis for the divergent pharmacological profiles of LTA4 hydrolase inhibitors. Moreover, they help define the binding pocket for the fatty acid-derived epoxide LTA4 as well as the subsites for a tripeptide substrate, which in turn have important implications for the molecular mechanisms of enzyme catalyses.",

        "abstract": "We investigated how elevated quantal release produced by motor nerve stimulation affects the size of the quanta. The motor nerve was stimulated at 10 Hz in preparations in which excitation-contraction coupling was disrupted. Two hundred stimuli reduced the size of the time integrals of the miniature endplate currents ([integral]MEPCs), measured at the same junction immediately after stimulation, by 16 %. Three thousand stimuli reduced size by 23 %. When the solution contained 10 microM neostigmine (NEO) 3000 stimuli reduced [integral]MEPCs by 60 %, because with acetylcholinesterase (AChE) inhibited, [integral]MEPC size is more sensitive to changes in acetylcholine (ACh) content. Similar decreases in miniature endplate potential size ([integral]MEPP) followed repetitive stimulation of contracting preparations. The depolarization produced by iontophoretic pulses of ACh was scarcely changed by 3000 nerve stimuli at 10 Hz, suggesting that the decreases in miniature sizes are largely due to less ACh released per quantum. Following 3000 stimuli at 10 Hz the sizes of the [integral]MEPCs increased back to pre-stimulus values with a half-time of 8-10 min. Recovery was blocked by (-)-vesamicol (VES), by hemicholinium-3 (HC3) and by nicotinic cholinergic agonists - all of which inhibit ACh loading into synaptic vesicles. The number of quanta in the total store was estimated by releasing them with carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP). CCCP releases fewer quanta after stimulation than from unstimulated controls. After resting for hours following stimulation, the releasable number increased, even when ACh loading inhibitors were present. We conclude that the inhibitors do not block a significant fraction of the ACh loading into reformed reserve vesicles and propose that ACh can be loaded in a series of steps.",

        "abstract": "Although the TEM-1 beta-lactamase (BlaTEM-1) hydrolyzes penicillins and narrow-spectrum cephalosporins, organisms expressing this enzyme are typically susceptible to beta-lactam/beta-lactamase inhibitor combinations such as piperacillin-tazobactam (TZP). However, our previous work led to the discovery of 28 clinical isolates of Escherichia coli resistant to TZP that contained only blaTEM-1 One of these isolates, E. coli 907355, was investigated further in this study. E. coli 907355 exhibited significantly higher beta-lactamase activity and BlaTEM-1 protein levels when grown in the presence of subinhibitory concentrations of TZP. A corresponding TZP-dependent increase in blaTEM-1 copy number was also observed, with as many as 113 copies of the gene detected per cell. These results suggest that TZP treatment promotes an increase in blaTEM-1 gene dosage, allowing BlaTEM-1 to reach high enough levels to overcome inactivation by the available tazobactam in the culture. To better understand the nature of the blaTEM-1 copy number proliferation, whole-genome sequence (WGS) analysis was performed on E. coli 907355 in the absence and presence of TZP. The WGS data revealed that the blaTEM-1 gene is located in a 10-kb genomic resistance module (GRM) that contains multiple resistance genes and mobile genetic elements. The GRM was found to be tandemly repeated at least 5 times within a p1ESCUM/p1ECUMN-like plasmid when bacteria were grown in the presence of TZP.IMPORTANCE Understanding how bacteria acquire resistance to antibiotics is essential for treating infected patients effectively, as well as preventing the spread of resistant organisms. In this study, a clinical isolate of E. coli was identified that dedicated more than 15% of its genome toward tandem amplification of a ~10-kb resistance module, allowing it to escape antibiotic-mediated killing. Our research is significant in that it provides one possible explanation for clinical isolates that exhibit discordant behavior when tested for antibiotic resistance by different phenotypic methods. Our research also shows that GRM amplification is difficult to detect by short-read WGS technologies. Analysis of raw long-read sequence data was required to confirm GRM amplification as a mechanism of antibiotic resistance.",

Some low nanomolar/subnanomolar inhibitors against such isoforms were detected, such as among others metolazone against CA VII, XII and XIII, chlorthalidone against CA VB, VII, IX, XII and XIII, indapamide against CA VII, IX, XII and XIII, furosemide against CA I, II and XIV, and bumethanide against CA IX and XII. The X-ray crystal structure of the CA II-indapamide adduct was also resolved at high resolution, and the binding of this sulfonamide to the enzyme was compared to that of dichlorophenamide, sulpiride and a pyridinium containing sulfonamide. Indapamide binds to CA II in a manner not seen earlier for any other CA inhibitor, which might be important for the design of compounds with a different inhibition profile.",

        "abstract": "1. The present study was undertaken to isolate and characterize pharmacologically homogeneous populations of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptors from a possible mixed receptor population mediating concentration of the longitudinal muscle of rat stomach fundus. Our aim was to extend the pharmacological characterization of the 5-HT2B receptor which is reported to be expressed in this preparation. 2. To minimize spontaneous activity and any influence of circular muscle on the contractile response, narrow (1-1.5 x 20 mm) segments of mucosa-denuded longitudinal muscle were used. Under these conditions, blockade of monoamine oxidase with pargyline (100 microM for 15 min) caused a leftward displacement of concentration-effect curves for both 5-methoxytryptamine (5-MeO-T) and tryptamine. Neither pargyline nor a number of uptake inhibitors affected responses to 5-HT. 3. In pargyline pretreated preparations, the order of potency of a number of tryptamine analogues was as follows: 5-MeO-T &gt; or = alpha-Me-5-HT &gt; or = 5-HT &gt; 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT) &gt; tryptamine &gt; 2-Me-5-HT. In addition several ligands known to act as agonists at either 5-HT2A or 5-HT2C receptors including 1-m-chlorophenylpiperazine (m-CPP), Ru 24969, MK 212 and SCH 23390 were also agonists in rat fundus whilst sumatriptan, renzapride and 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino) tetralin (8-OH-DPAT) were very weak or inactive. With the exception of 2-Me-5-HT and m-CPP, most agonists produced monophasic concentration-effect curves consistent with an interaction at a single site. High concentrations of 2-Me-5-HT evoked relaxations which were blocked by phentolamine (1 MicroM) suggesting an interaction with alpha-adrenoceptors. m-CPP often evoked biphasic concentration-effect curves with a second contractile phase which was insensitive to yohimbine at concentrations higher than required for antagonism of responses to 5-HT.4. LY 53857, methiothepin, methysergide, ritanserin and ICI 170809 were potent but non-surmountable antagonists of 5-HT in rat fundus. In contrast, several ligands behaved as surmountable antagonists with the following order of potency: rauwolscine &gt;yohimbine = mesulergine &gt; mianserin = SB 204070 &gt;WY 26703 &gt; SB 200646&gt; pirenpirone&gt; renzapride. DAU 6285, granisetron, spiperone, ketanserin,phentolamine and GR 127935 did not affect responses to 5-HT at concentrations up to 1 pM. The agonist and concentration independent profile of antagonism supported a single site interaction for both agonists and antagonists.5. We conclude that despite small differences concerning the enantiomeric selectivity and affinity of rauwolscine and yohimbine, the close pharmacological identity of 5-HT receptors in rat stomach fundus and the recently cloned 5-HT2B receptor is maintained. SB 200646, which demonstrates some selectivity for 5-HT receptors in rat stomach fundus, should provide a useful ligand for confirmation of this view and allow discrimination of 5-HT2B function both in vitro and in vivo.",

Enalkiren has been shown to produce dose-related suppression of plasma renin activity (PRA) and angiotensin II when administered intravenously. Doses of enalkiren of less than 0.1 mg/kg induced little hemodynamic response in normotensive and hypertensive volunteers despite marked suppression of PRA. However, at doses of 0.3 and 1.2 mg/kg, enalkiren produced significant, dose-related decreases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP) in hypertensive patients, and the BP response was enhanced by pretreatment with hydrochlorothiazide. The effects of enalkiren on PRA and BP are prolonged despite its relatively short elimination phase plasma half-life (1.6 h). Persistent pharmacologic activity without evidence of tachyphylaxis was demonstrated during 1 week of treatment in hypertensive patients. The observed dissociation between suppression of PRA and BP response and the recruitment of dose-related BP decrements, despite complete suppression of PRA, are unexplained phenomena. The results of clinical trials with enalkiren are encouraging, and suggest that renin inhibitors may be safe, useful therapeutic agents in the management of hypertension.",

Suramin caused a parallel shift to the right of the concentration-response curves for 2MeSATP in the t-P2Y-1321N1 cells, yielding a Schild plot with a slope of 1.16 +/- 0.08 and a pA2 value of 5.77 +/- 0.11. 3. Suramin also caused a shift to the right of concentration-response curves for UTP in the h-P2U-1321N1 cells, and on Schild plots gave a slope different from unity (1.57 +/- 0.19) and an apparent pA2 value of 4.32 +/- 0.13. Suramin was therefore a less potent antagonist at the P2U-purinoceptor than the P2Y-purinoceptor. 4. In the presence of the ectonucleotidase inhibitor, ARL 67156 (6-N,N-diethyl-beta,gamma-dibromomethylene-D-ATP) there was no significant difference in the EC50 or shapes of curves with either cell type, and no difference in pA2 values for suramin. 5. PPADS caused an increase in the EC50 for 2MeSATP in the t-P2Y-1321N1 cells. The Schild plot had a slope different from unity (0.55 +/- 0.15) and an X-intercept corresponding to an apparent pA2 of 5.98 +/- 0.65. 6. PPADS up to 30 microM had no effect on the concentration-response curve for UTP with the h-P2U-1321N1 cells. 7. In conclusion, suramin and PPADS show clear differences in their action at the 2 receptor types, in each case being substantially more effective as an antagonist at the P2Y-purinoceptor than at the P2U-purinoceptor. Ectonucleotidase breakdown had little influence on the nature of the responses at the two receptor types, or in their differential sensitivity to suramin.",

The activities of liver lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) , malic enzyme (ME), and ATP citrate lyase were decreased in vitamin B6-DEFICIENT RATS, AND THEIR LIVEr G6PD was further decreased by the addition of glycine and hydroxyproline to their diets. Supplementing control diets with the two amino acids decreased the activities of rat liver LDH, G6PD, and ATP citrate lyase. The effects of glycine and hydroxyproline feeding on the enzymes studied did not appear related to alterations in insulin availability. Since in vitamin B6-deficient rats, there are increases in urinary levels of oxalic and glycolic acids, and glycine, and increases in tissue levels of glyoxylic acid and glycine, the effects of these metabolites on the activities of the above mentioned enzymes were measured. Oxalic acid inhibited the activities of LDH, G6PD, and ME. Glyoxylic acid inhibited LDH and ME, but not G6PD. Glycolic acid inhibited G6PD and ME, but not LDH. ATP citrate lyase was not affected by these substances. Glycine had no effect on the enzymes studied.

        "abstract": "The thymidine kinases from feline herpesvirus (FHV TK) and canine herpesvirus (CHV TK) were cloned and characterized. The two proteins are closely sequence-related to each other and also to the herpes simplex virus type 1 thymidine kinase (HSV-1 TK). Although FHV TK and CHV TK have a level of identity of 31 and 35%, respectively, with HSV-1 TK, and a general amino acid similarity of approximately 54% with HSV-1 TK, they do not recognize the same broad range of substrates as HSV-1 TK does. Instead the substrate recognition is restricted to dThd and pyrimidine analogs such as 1-beta-d-arabinofuranosylthymine (araT), 3'-azido-2',3'-dideoxythymidine (AZT) and (E)-5-(2-bromovinyl)-2'-deoxyuridine (BVDU). FHV TK and CHV TK differ in substrate recognition from mammalian cytosolic thymidine kinase 1 (TK1) in that TK1 does not phosphorylate BVDU and they also differ from mammalian mitochondrial thymidine kinase 2 (TK2), which, in addition to thymidine and thymidine analogs also phosphorylates dCyd. Although the nucleoside analog BVDU was a good substrate for FHV and CHV TK, the compound was poorly inhibitory to virus-induced cytopathic effect in FHV- and CHV-infected cells. The reason is likely the poor, if any, thymidylate kinase activity of FHV and CHV TK, which in HSV-1 TK-expressing cells convert BVDU-MP to its 5'-diphosphate derivative.",

In Candida albicans, Microsporum canis, Trichophyton mentagrophytes as well as in Epidermophyton floccosum the ergosterol precursor 24-methylendihydrolanosterol accumulates, whereas in Torulopsis glabrata lanosterol accumulation occurs, due to the fact that in this organism side chain alkylation proceeds after demethylation reactions. Bifonazole additionally leads to a generally decreased rate of sterol biosynthesis as compared to clotrimazole, due to a direct inhibition of microsomal HMG-CoA-reductase.

Here we show that suramin binds to human alpha-thrombin inhibiting both the hydrolysis of the synthetic substrate S-2238 (IC50 = 40 microM), and the thrombin-induced fibrinogen clotting (IC50 = 20 microM). The latter is completely reversed by albumin (30 mg mL(-1)) suggesting that, at therapeutic concentrations, suramin is unable to affect alpha-thrombin activity in the plasma. Kinetic analysis showed that suramin acts as a non-competitive inhibitor decreasing Vmax without changing the Km for S-2238 hydrolysis. Calorimetric studies revealed two distinct binding sites for suramin in alpha-thrombin. In addition, circular dichroism studies showed that suramin causes significant changes in alpha-thrombin tertiary structure, without affecting the secondary structure content. Interaction with alpha-thrombin resulted in an increased fluorescence emission of the drug. Complex formation was strongly affected by high ionic strength suggesting the involvement of electrostatic interactions. Altogether our data suggest that part of the biological activities of suramin might be related to alpha-thrombin inhibition at extra-vascular sites.",

Since the degeneration of retinal neurons is an early event in the diabetic retina, studies to characterize the molecular mechanisms of diabetes-induced retinal neuronal damage and dysfunction are of high significance. We have demonstrated that spermine oxidase (SMOX), a mediator of polyamine oxidation is critically involved in causing neurovascular damage in the retina. The involvement of SMOX in diabetes-induced retinal neuronal damage is completely unknown. Utilizing the streptozotocin-induced mouse model of diabetes, the impact of the SMOX inhibitor, MDL 72527, on neuronal damage and dysfunction in the diabetic retina was investigated. Retinal function was assessed by electroretinography (ERG) and retinal architecture was evaluated using spectral domain-optical coherence tomography. Retinal cryosections were prepared for immunolabeling of inner retinal neurons and retinal lysates were used for Western blotting. We observed a marked decrease in retinal function in diabetic mice compared to the non-diabetic controls. Treatment with MDL 72527 significantly improved the ERG responses in diabetic retinas. Diabetes-induced retinal thinning was also inhibited by the MDL 72527 treatment. Our analysis further showed that diabetes-induced retinal ganglion cell damage and neurodegeneration were markedly attenuated by MDL 72527 treatment.

The binding decrease was significant after 5 min, remained at similar reduced levels between 5- and 30-min incubations with agonist, and only a partial recovery was observed after 90-min washout (34, 41, and 44% at 90, 120, and 150 min, respectively). Saturation analysis showed a significant decrease in both receptor density (-44% +/- 9%) and affinity (dissociation constant, Kd 1.15 +/- 0.23 nM from 0.59 +/- 0.17 nM). The effect of immepip was mimicked by histamine and the H3 agonists imetit and R-alpha-methylhistamine, and was blocked by the H3 antagonist thioperamide. The reduction in [3H]-NMHA binding was fully and partially prevented by incubation at 4 degrees C and in hypertonic medium, respectively, but not by the endocytosis inhibitor phenylarsine oxide (10 microM). None of the following protein kinase inhibitors, Ro-318220 and Go-6976 (PKC), H-89 (PKA) and staurosporine (general inhibitor) prevented the effect of immepip. In [3H]-adenine-labeled slices the preincubation with immepip (100 nM, 15 min) prevented the inhibitory effect of H3 receptor activation on forskolin-induced [3H]-cAMP accumulation (99% +/- 9% vs. 76% +/- 4% of control values).

We demonstrate that DHEA regulates PPARalpha action by altering both the levels and phosphorylation status of the receptor. Human hepatoma cells (HepG2) were transiently transfected with the expression plasmid encoding PPARalpha and a plasmid containing two copies of fatty acyl coenzyme oxidase (FACO) peroxisome-proliferator activated receptor responsive element consensus oligonucleotide in a luciferase reporter gene. Nafenopin treatment increased reporter gene activity in this system, whereas DHEA treatment did not. Okadaic acid significantly decreased nafenopin-induced reporter activity in a concentration-dependent manner. Okadaic acid treatment of primary rat hepatocytes decreased both DHEA- and nafenopin-induced FACO activity in primary rat hepatocytes. DHEA induced both PPARalpha mRNA and protein levels, as well as PP2A message in primary rat hepatocytes. Western blot analysis showed that the serines at positions 12 and 21 were rapidly dephosphorylated upon treatment with DHEA and nafenopin. Results using specific protein phosphatase inhibitors suggested that protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A) is responsible for DHEA action, and protein phosphatase 1 might be involved in nafenopin induction. Mutation of serines at position 6, 12, and 21 to an uncharged alanine residue significantly increased transcriptional activity, whereas mutation to negative charged aspartate residues (mimicking receptor phosphorylation) decreased transcriptional activity. DHEA action involves induction of PPARalpha mRNA and protein levels as well as increased PPARalpha transcriptional activity through decreasing receptor phosphorylation at serines in the AF1 region.",

Surface plasmon resonance studies have shown that niflumic acid binds to Naja naja sagittifera PLA(2) with an affinity that corresponds to a dissociation constant (K(d)) of 4.3 x 10(-5) M. Binding studies of PLA(2) with niflumic acid were also carried out using a standard PLA(2) kit that gave an approximate binding constant, K(i), of 1.26 +/- 0.05 x 10(-6) M. Therefore, in order to establish the viability of PLA(2) as a potential target molecule for drug design against inflammation, arthritis and rheumatism, the three-dimensional structure of the complex of PLA(2) with the known anti-inflammatory agent niflumic acid [2-[3-(trifluoromethyl)anilino]nicotinic acid] has been determined at 2.5 Angstroms resolution. The structure of the complex has been refined to an R factor of 0.187. The structure determination reveals the presence of one niflumic acid molecule at the substrate-binding site of PLA(2). It shows that niflumic acid interacts with the important active-site residues His48 and Asp49 through two water molecules. It is observed that the niflumic acid molecule is completely buried in the substrate-binding hydrophobic channel. The conformations of the binding site in PLA(2) as well as that of niflumic acid are not altered upon binding.

It possesses a potent antagonistic activity at 5-hydroxytryptamine (serotonin) 2A (5-HT2A) receptors and also binds to dopamine (D1, D2) receptors with partial agonism at presynaptic D2 receptors and postsynaptic antagonism. Further, preclinical data demonstrated that lumateperone uniquely acts as an indirect modulator of glutamatergic phosphoprotein with D1-dependent augmentation of both NMDA and AMPA activity via the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, mechanisms thought to predict potent and rapid antidepressant effects. Previous results of schizophrenia efficacy studies found robust improvements in depressive as well as psychotic symptoms for those patients who were comorbidly depressed. In various clinical trials to date, the safety profile of lumateperone was found to be similar to that of placebo. These promising results and strong performance in phase II studies point to the potential of lumateperone to display potent and rapid antidepressant effects in patients suffering from a range of mood disorders. Currently, this novel drug is in phase III of its clinical development for schizophrenia, agitation associated with dementia and bipolar depression.",

        "title": "Sitagliptin, a DPP-4 inhibitor for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes: a review of recent clinical trials.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors are a new class of oral antihyperglycemic agents that enhance the body's ability to regulate blood glucose by increasing the active levels of incretins, glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP). There are numerous DPP-4 inhibitors in development with sitagliptin as the first approved agent for the treatment of patients with type 2 diabetes. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the clinical trial results with sitagliptin. METHODS: Clinical trials published between January 2005 (first sitagliptin publication) and November 2007 were included in this review. Medline was searched using the search terms: MK-0431 or sitagliptin. FINDINGS: Sitagliptin, an oral, once-daily, and highly selective DPP-4 inhibitor, has been evaluated in clinical trials as monotherapy, as add-on therapy, or as initial combination therapy with metformin. Sitagliptin provided effective fasting and postprandial glycemic control in a wide range of patients with type 2 diabetes. Markers of beta-cell function (HOMA-beta and proinsulin/insulin ratio) were improved with sitagliptin treatment. In these clinical trials, sitagliptin was generally well tolerated with an overall incidence of adverse experiences comparable to placebo, a low risk of hypoglycemia or gastrointestinal adverse experiences, and a neutral effect on body weight. The findings presented in this review are limited to the specific patient population enrolled in each clinical trial and for durations for up to 1 year. Future clinical studies should evaluate whether this class of agents has the potential to delay progression and/or prevent type 2 diabetes. CONCLUSIONS: Sitagliptin has been shown to be effective and well-tolerated in various treatment regimens and may be considered for both initial therapy and as add-on therapy for patients with type 2 diabetes.",

        "abstract": "First-generation microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTP) inhibitors were designed to inhibit hepatic MTP and provide a novel treatment of dyslipidemia. Effective at lowering low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), these inhibitors also elevate liver enzymes and induce hepatic steatosis in animals and humans. MTP is highly expressed in the enterocytes, lining the lumen of the jejunum, and is critical in the production of chylomicrons assembled from lipid/cholesterol and their transfer into systemic circulation. 6-(4'-Trifluoromethyl-6-methoxy-biphenyl-2-ylcarboxamido)-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-2-carboxylic acid phenyl ester (SLx-4090) (IC(50) value ~8 nM) was designed to inhibit only MTP localized to enterocytes. In Caco-2 cells SLx-4090 inhibited apolipoprotein B (IC(50) value ~9.6 nM) but not apolipoprotein A1 secretion. Administered orally to rats SLx-4090 reduced postprandial lipids by &gt;50% with an ED(50) value ~7 mg/kg. SLx-4090 was not detected in the systemic or portal vein serum of the animals (lower limit of quantitation ~5 ng/ml) after single or multiple oral doses in fasted rodents. When coadministered with tyloxapol, SLx-4090 did not inhibit the secretion of hepatic triglycerides (TG), consistent with the absence of systemic exposure. Chronic treatment with SLx-4090 in mice maintained on a high-fat diet decreased LDL-C and TG and resulted in weight loss without the elevation of liver enzymes or an increase in hepatic fat. The compound did not result in toxicity when administered to rats for 90 days at a dose of 1000 mg/kg per day. These data support the concept that the inhibition of enterocytic MTP could serve as a useful strategy in the treatment of metabolic disorders.",

It has been used in China for centuries for the treatment of swelling, fever and blood disorders. It has demonstrated both memory enhancement in animal and clinical trials and neuroprotective effects. Recently it has undergone double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials in patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD), with significant improvements both to cognitive function and the quality of life. Most of the clinical trials are from China, but HupA and derivatives are attracting considerable interest in the West, where AD is a major and growing concern. Furthermore, both animal and human safety evaluations have demonstrated that HupA is devoid of unexpected toxicity. Other interesting aspects of HupA pharmacological profile relate to its neuroprotective properties: it has been shown in animal studies that HupA can be used as a protective agent against organophosphate (OP) intoxication and that it reduces glutamate-induced cell death.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The opioid receptor antagonists naloxone and naltrexone are competitive antagonists at the mu, kappa, and sigma receptors with a higher affinity for the mu receptor and lacking any mu receptor efficacy. Buprenorphine is classified as a partial agonist. It has a high affinity, but low efficacy at the mu receptor where it yields a partial effect upon binding. It also, however, possesses kappa receptor antagonist activity making it useful not only as an analgesic, but also in opioid abuse deterrence, detoxification, and maintenance therapies. Naloxone is added to sublingual buprenorphine (Suboxone) to prevent the intravenous abuse of buprenorphine. The same product (sublingual buprenorphine) when used alone (i.e. without naloxone) is marketed as Subutex. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate and update the available evidence regarding the use of agonist/antagonists to provide office-based opioid treatment for addiction. METHODS: A review using databases of EMBASE and MEDLINE (1992 to December 2007). These included systematic reviews, narrative reviews, prospective and retrospective studies, as well as cross-references from other articles. OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was treatment retention. Other outcome measures included opioid-free urine drug testing, opioid craving, intensity of withdrawal, pain reduction, adverse effects, addiction severity index, and HIV risk behavior. RESULTS: The results found 17 studies, 1 systematic review, 12 RCTs, and 4 observational series, which document the efficacy and safety of buprenorphine alone and in combination with naloxone in detoxifying and maintaining abstinence from illicit drugs in patients with opioid addiction. CONCLUSION: Based on the present evaluation, it appears that opioid antagonists, partial agonists, and antagonists are useful in office-based opioid treatment for addiction.",

        "abstract": "INTRODUCTION: Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) shares structural homology with the matrix metalloproteinase family of proteolytic enzymes (MMPs) responsible for degradation of the extracellular matrix (ECM). ACE inhibitors have been reported to protect against cancer in patients. The aim of this study was to determine whether the ACE inhibitor, captopril, could impair the activity of MMPs and impact on tumour invasion and growth in a cell line and murine model. METHODS: For proof of principle, the protein activity of human MMP-2 and MMP-9 produced by the HT1080 fibrosarcoma cell line was detected using gelatin zymography. Gene expression was determined by real time reverse transcriptase PCR and tumour cell invasion using Matrigel invasion chambers. The effect of captopril on the in vivo growth of MGLVA-1 human gastric adenocarcinoma xenografts was evaluated in a nude mouse model. RESULTS: Captopril inhibited activity of secreted MMP-9 and MMP-2, however, gene expression in HT1080 remained unaltered. Invasion of HT1080 cells was inhibited by 48% (p&lt;0.001). Tumour size was reduced by 40-50% with 0.4 mg/ml captopril (p&lt;0.01) and when combined with cisplatin the inhibition increased to 71% (p&lt;0.05). DISCUSSION: ACE inhibitors inhibit the activity of secreted MMP-2 and -9 by a mechanism similar to synthetic MMP inhibitors. ACE inhibitors have previously been shown to inhibit tumour growth, however; this is the first study to demonstrate inhibition of a human gastric xenograft, both alone and in combination with cisplatin. These results support further investigation into the anticancer effects of ACE inhibitors.",

Significance for the modulation of frontocortical monoaminergic transmission and depressive states.",
        "abstract": "Herein, we evaluate the interaction of the alpha(2)-AR antagonist, yohimbine, as compared to fluparoxan, at multiple monoaminergic receptors and examine their roles in the modulation of adrenergic, dopaminergic and serotonergic transmission in freely-moving rats. Yohimbine displays marked affinity at human (h)alpha(2A)-, halpha(2B)- and halpha(2C)-ARs, significant affinity for h5-HT(1A), h5-HT(1B), h5-HT(1D), and hD(2) receptors and weak affinity for hD(3) receptors. In [(35)S]GTPgammaS binding protocols, yohimbine exerts antagonist actions at halpha(2A)-AR, h5-HT(1B), h5-HT(1D), and hD(2) sites, yet partial agonist actions at h5-HT(1A) sites. In vivo, agonist actions of yohimbine at 5-HT(1A) sites are revealed by WAY100,635-reversible induction of hypothermia in the rat. In guinea pigs, antagonist actions of yohimbine at 5-HT(1B) receptors are revealed by blockade of hypothermia evoked by the 5-HT(1B) agonist, GR46,611. In distinction to yohimbine, fluparoxan shows only modest partial agonist actions at h5-HT(1A) sites versus marked antagonist actions at halpha(2)-ARs. While fluparoxan selectively enhances hippocampal noradrenaline (NAD) turnover, yohimbine also enhances striatal dopamine (DA) turnover and suppresses striatal turnover of 5-HT. Further, yohimbine decreases firing of serotonergic neurones in raphe nuclei, an action reversed by WAY100,635. Fluparoxan increases extracellular levels of DA and NAD, but not 5-HT, in frontal cortex. In analogy, yohimbine enhances FCX levels of DA and NAD, yet suppresses those of 5-HT, the latter effect being antagonized by WAY100,635. The induction by fluoxetine of FCX levels of 5-HT, DA, and NAD is potentiated by fluparoxan. Yohimbine likewise facilitates the influence of fluoxetine upon DA and NAD levels, but not those of 5-HT. In conclusion, the alpha(2)-AR antagonist properties of yohimbine increase DA and NAD levels both alone and in association with fluoxetine. However, in contrast to the selective alpha(2)-AR antagonist, fluparoxan, the 5-HT(1A) agonist actions of yohimbine suppress 5-HT levels alone and underlie its inability to augment the influence of fluoxetine upon 5-HT levels.",

        "abstract": "Talnetant and osanetant, two structurally diverse antagonists of neurokinin-3 receptor (NK3), displayed distinct modes of action in Ca2+ mobilization. Although talnetant showed a normal Schild plot with a slope close to unity and a Kb similar to its Ki value in binding, osanetant presented an aberrant Schild with a steep slope (3.3 +/- 0.5) and a Kb value (12 nM) significantly elevated compared with its Ki value (0.8 nM) in binding. Kinetic binding experiments indicated a simple one-step binding mechanism with relatively fast on- and off-rates for both antagonists, arguing against slow onset of antagonism as the reason for abnormal Schild. This conclusion was supported by prolonged preincubation of antagonist that failed to improve the observed aberrant Schild. In ligand cross-competition binding, both talnetant and osanetant displayed linear reciprocal plots of identical slope when [MePhe7]neurokinin B (NKB) was used as the other competition partner with 125I-[MePhe7]NKB as the radioligand, indicating competitive binding of either antagonist with regard to [MePhe7]NKB. Similar patterns were obtained when talnetant was tested against osanetant, indicating competitive binding between the two antagonists as well. These results were reproduced when [3H]4-quinolinecarboxamide (SB222200), a close derivative of talnetant, was used as the radioligand. Taken together, these data strongly suggest binding of both talnetant and osanetant at the orthosteric binding site with similar kinetic properties and do not support the hypothesis that the aberrant Schild observed in functional assays for osanetant is derived from differences in the mechanism of binding for these NK3 antagonists.",

        "abstract": "In the last decade, advances in understanding the neurobiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) have translated into an increase in clinical trials assessing various potential AD treatments. At present, drugs used for the treatment of AD only slightly delay the inevitable symptomatic progression of the disease and do not affect the main neuropathological hallmarks of the disease, i.e. senile plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. Brain accumulation of oligomeric species of beta-amyloid (A beta) peptides, the principal components of senile plaques, is believed to play a crucial role in the development of AD. Based on this hypothesis, huge efforts are being made to identify drugs able to interfere with proteases regulating A beta formation from amyloid precursor protein (APP). Compounds that stimulate alpha-secretase, the enzyme responsible for non-amyloidogenic metabolism of APP, are being developed and one of these, EHT-0202, has recently commenced evaluation in a phase II study. The discovery of inhibitors of beta-secretase (memapsin-2, beta-amyloid cleaving enzyme-1 [BACE-1]), the enzyme that regulates the first step of amyloidogenic APP metabolism, has proved to be particularly difficult because of inherent medicinal chemistry issues and only one compound (CTS-21166) has proceeded to clinical testing. Conversely, several compounds that inhibit gamma-secretase, the pivotal enzyme that generates A beta, have been identified, the most advanced being LY-450139 (semagacestat), presently in phase III clinical development. There has been considerable disappointment over the failure of a phase III study of tarenflurbil, a compound believed to modulate the activity of gamma-secretase, after encouraging phase II findings. Nevertheless, other promising gamma-secretase modulators are being developed and are approaching clinical testing. All these therapeutic approaches increase the hope of slowing the rate of decline in patients with AD and modifying the natural history of this devastating disease within the next 5 years.",

        "abstract": "Neurokinin-3 (NK3) receptors are concentrated in forebrain and basal ganglia structures within the mammalian CNS. This distribution, together with the modulatory influence of NK3 receptors on monoaminergic neurotransmission, has led to the hypothesis that NK3 receptor antagonists may have therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of psychiatric disorders. Here we describe the in vitro and in vivo characterization of the highly selective NK3 receptor antagonist talnetant (SB-223412). Talnetant has high affinity for recombinant human NK3 receptors (pKi 8.7) and demonstrates selectivity over other neurokinin receptors (pKi NK2 = 6.6 and NK1&lt;4). In native tissue-binding studies, talnetant displayed high affinity for the guinea pig NK3 receptor (pKi 8.5). Functionally, talnetant competitively antagonized neurokinin B (NKB)-induced responses at the human recombinant receptor in both calcium and phosphoinositol second messenger assay systems (pA2 of 8.1 and 7.7, respectively). In guinea pig brain slices, talnetant antagonized NKB-induced increases in neuronal firing in the medial habenula (pKB = 7.9) and senktide-induced increases in neuronal firing in the substantia nigra pars compacta (pKB = 7.7) with no diminution of maximal agonist efficacy, suggesting competitive antagonism at native NK3 receptors. Talnetant (3-30 mg/kg i.p.) significantly attenuated senktide-induced 'wet dog shake' behaviors in the guinea pig in a dose-dependent manner. Microdialysis studies demonstrated that acute administration of talnetant (30 mg/kg i.p.) produced significant increases in extracellular dopamine and norepinephrine in the medial prefrontal cortex and attenuated haloperidol-induced increases in nucleus accumbens dopamine levels in the freely moving guinea pigs. Taken together, these data demonstrate that talnetant is a selective, competitive, brain-penetrant NK3 receptor antagonist with the ability to modulate mesolimbic and mesocortical dopaminergic neurotransmission and hence support its potential therapeutic utility in the treatment of schizophrenia.",

The R-enantiomer of modafinil might have unique pharmacological properties that should be further investigated. METHODS: (+-)-Modafinil and its R-(-)- and S-(+)-enantiomers were synthesized and tested for inhibition of [(3)H] dopamine (DA) uptake and [(3)H]WIN 35428 binding in human dopamine transporter (DAT) wild-type and mutants with altered conformational equilibria. Data were compared with cocaine and the atypical DA uptake inhibitor, JHW 007.

RESULTS: (+-)-, R-, and S-modafinil bind to the DAT and inhibit DA uptake less potently than cocaine, with R-modafinil having approximately threefold higher affinity than its S-enantiomer. Molecular docking studies revealed subtle differences in binding modes for the enantiomers. R-modafinil was significantly less potent in the DAT Y156F mutant compared with wild-type DAT, whereas S-modafinil was affected less. Studies with the Y335A DAT mutant showed that the R- and S-enantiomers tolerated the inward-facing conformation better than cocaine, which was further supported by [2-(trimethylammonium)ethyl]-methanethiosulfonate reactivity on the DAT E2C I159C. Microdialysis studies demonstrated that both R- and S-modafinil produced increases in extracellular DA concentrations in the nucleus accumbens shell less efficaciously than cocaine and with a longer duration of action. Both enantiomers fully substituted in mice trained to discriminate cocaine from saline. CONCLUSIONS: R-modafinil displays an in vitro profile different from cocaine. Future trials with R-modafinil as a substitute therapy with the potential benefit of cognitive enhancement for psychostimulant addiction are warranted.",

        "title": "Histamine and betahistine in the treatment of vertigo: elucidation of mechanisms of action.",
        "abstract": "The aim of this review is to provide clinicians with a picture of the mechanisms by which: histamine and histaminergic agonists act on the vestibular system both peripherally and centrally; and histaminergic agonists and antagonists interfere with the recovery process after peripheral vestibular lesion. We have focused on betahistine, a structural analogue of histamine with weak histamine H(1) receptor agonist and more potent H(3) receptor antagonist properties, to review the currently available data on the role of the histaminergic system in the recovery process after peripheral vestibular deficits and the effects of histamine analogues in the clinical treatment of vertigo. This review provides new insights into the basic mechanisms by which betahistine improves vestibular compensation in animal models of unilateral vestibular dysfunction, and elucidates particularly the mechanisms of action of this substance at the level of the CNS. It is proposed that betahistine may reduce peripherally the asymmetric functioning of the sensory vestibular organs in addition to increasing vestibulocochlear blood flow by antagonising local H(3) heteroreceptors. Betahistine acts centrally by enhancing histamine synthesis within tuberomammillary nuclei of the posterior hypothalamus and histamine release within vestibular nuclei through antagonism of H(3) autoreceptors. This mechanism, together with less specific effects of betahistine on alertness regulation through cerebral H(1) receptors, should promote and facilitate central vestibular compensation. Elucidation of the mechanisms of action of betahistine is of particular interest for the treatment of vestibular and cochlear disorders and vertigo.",

        "title": "The androgen derivative 5alpha-androstane-3beta,17beta-diol inhibits tumor necrosis factor alpha and lipopolysaccharide induced inflammatory response in human endothelial cells and in mice aorta.",
        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: An increasing body of evidence suggests that testosterone may exert beneficial effects against the development of atherosclerosis. These effects are thought to be the consequence of its conversion into estradiol and the activation of the estrogen receptors; however a direct role of androgens, such as dihydrotestosterone, has also been proposed. More recently, it has been shown that the transformation of the dihydrotestosterone to 5alpha-androstane-3alpha,17beta-diol (3alpha-diol) and 5alpha-androstane-3beta,17beta-diol (3beta-Adiol), generates two molecules unable to bind the androgen receptor, but with a high affinity for the estrogen receptors (ERs) in particular the beta isoform. As the actions of testosterone may result from the balance between androgenic and estrogenic molecules originating from its catabolism, we investigated the effects of the 3beta-Adiol on inflammatory responses in vitro in human endothelial cells and ex vivo in mice aortas. METHODS AND RESULTS: 3beta-Adiol reverts the pro-inflammatory gene expression pattern induced by TNF-alpha in HUVECs as determined by a cDNA microrray approach. Q-real-time PCR and protein array approaches confirmed that TNF-alpha-induced ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and ELAM-1 as well as MCP-1 and IL-6 induction was affected upon 3beta-Adiol pre-incubation. ICI 182780, an estrogen receptor antagonist and R,R-THC, an estrogen receptor beta antagonist, counteracted the effect of 3beta-Adiol while bicalutamide, an androgen receptor antagonist, had minor effects. 3beta-Adiol exerted a similar action on macrophages. Finally in castrated male mice, 3beta-Adiol significantly counteracted the LPS mediated mRNA induction of IL-6, ELAM-1and PECAM-1 in the aortas. CONCLUSION: 3beta-Adiol reverts in vitro the TNF-alpha and LPS induced pro-inflammatory activation of endothelial cells and macrophages. 3beta-Adiol in vivo modulates the inflammatory response induced by LPS in the arterial vascular wall.",

        "abstract": "Ample evidence suggests that many of the in vivo anti-metastatic effects by heparins reflect their actions on P-selectin-mediated binding. We hypothesized that the ability of widely used heparins and derivatives to interfere with P-selectin-dependent tumour cell interactions under flow in vitro could be used to identify anticoagulants with advanced inhibitory functions on experimental blood-borne metastasis in vivo. To test this assumption, the impact of unfractionated heparin, the low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWH) nadroparin and enoxaparin, and the synthetic pentasaccharide fondaparinux on P-selectin-dependent tumour interactions in vitro and metastasis formation in vivo were evaluated. Our data revealed that these commonly used anticoagulants widely differ in their potential to interfere with P-selectinmediated cell binding. Importantly, the superior inhibitory capacity on P-selectin function of unfractionated heparin and LMWH nadroparin as opposed to LMWH enoxaparin and synthetic heparin pentasaccharide fondaparinux strongly correlated to the inhibitory potency of each in inhibiting experimental lung metastasis in vivo. Hence, P-selectin inhibition may constitute a valuable feature to identify anticoagulants that are suitable for anticancer therapy.",

Ketobemidone, methadone and pethidine were inhibitors of [3H]MK-801 binding with Ki values of 26 microM, 0.85 microM and 47 microM, respectively. In the cortex, 1 mM ketobemidone and 1 mM methadone reduced NMDA responses, but not (RS)-2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazol-4-yl) propionic acid (AMPA) or kainate responses in an use-dependent manner, whereas 1 mM pethidine was devoid of antagonist activity. In the spinal cord preparation, the activities of ketobemidone and methadone were weaker than in cortex. In contrast, pethidine was equipotent with ketobemidone in the spinal cord.

        "abstract": "PURPOSE: Patients with advanced, incurable thyroid cancer not amenable to surgery or radioactive iodine ((131)I) therapy have few satisfactory therapeutic options. This multi-institutional study assessed the activity and safety of axitinib, an oral, potent, and selective inhibitor of vascular endothelial growth factor receptors (VEGFR) 1, 2, and 3 in patients with advanced thyroid cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients with thyroid cancer of any histology that was resistant or not appropriate for (131)I were enrolled onto a single-arm phase II trial to receive axitinib orally (starting dose, 5 mg twice daily). Objective response rate (ORR) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors was the primary end point. Secondary end points included duration of response, progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival, safety, and modulation of soluble (s) VEGFR. RESULTS: Sixty patients were enrolled. Partial responses were observed in 18 patients, yielding an ORR of 30% (95% CI, 18.9 to 43.2). Stable disease lasting &gt; or = 16 weeks was reported in another 23 patients (38%). OBJECTIVE: responses were noted in all histologic subtypes. Median PFS was 18.1 months (95% CI, 12.1 to not estimable). Axitinib was generally well tolerated, with the most common grade &gt; or = 3 treatment-related adverse event being hypertension (n = 7; 12%). Eight patients (13%) discontinued treatment because of adverse events. Axitinib selectively decreased sVEGFR-2 and sVEGFR-3 plasma concentrations versus sKIT, demonstrating its targeting of VEGFR. CONCLUSION: Axitinib is a selective inhibitor of VEGFR with compelling antitumor activity in all histologic subtypes of advanced thyroid cancer.",

        "abstract": "Orally ingested glucose leads to a much higher insulin response than intravenous glucose leading to identical postprandial plasma glucose excursions. This phenomenon, termed ''incretin effect'' comprises up to 60% of the postprandial insulin secretion and is diminished in type 2 diabetes. The gastrointestinal hormones glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) promote the incretin effect. Type 2 diabetes is characterized by an incretin defect: while GIP does not stimulate insulin secretion, GLP-1 action is still preserved under supraphysiological concentrations. GLP-1 stimulates insulin secretion only under hyperglycaemic conditions, therefore it does not cause hypoglycaemia. Furthermore, GLP-1 inhibits glucagon secretion and delays gastric emptying. In vitro and animal data demonstrated that GLP-1 increases beta cell mass by stimulating islet cell neogenesis and by inhibiting apoptosis of islets. The improvement of beta cell function can be indirectly observed from the increased insulin secretory capacity of humans receiving GLP-1. In contrast to GIP, GLP-1 may represent an attractive therapeutic method for type 2 diabetes due to its multiple effects also including the simulation of satiety in the central nervous system by acting as transmitter or by crossing the blood brain barrier. Native GLP-1 is degraded rapidly upon intravenous or subcutaneous administration and is therefore not feasible for routine therapy. Long-acting GLP-1 analogs (e.g. Liraglutide) and exendin-4 (Exenatide, Byetta) that are resistant to degradation, called ''incretin mimetics'' are approved (Exenatide, Byetta) or in clinical trials. DPP-4-inhibitors (e.g. Vildagliptin), Sitagliptin and Saxagliptin) that inhibit the enzyme DPP-4 responsible for incretin degradation are also under study.",

Canagliflozin improves glycemic control in an insulin-independent fashion through inhibition of glucose reuptake in the kidney. AREAS COVERED: This article reviews the available data on the pharmacodynamics, the pharmacokinetics and metabolism, and the efficacy and safety of canagliflozin. Relevant articles were identified via PubMed using the search term canagliflozin with no date restriction. The authors also discuss the abstracts from canagliflozin studies presented at large diabetes conferences. EXPERT OPINION: Canagliflozin offers a relatively modest reduction in HbA1c, FPG, and PPG. It has a low incidence of hypoglycemia and a reduction in body weight. Dose adjustment may be recommended in the elderly, those on loop diuretics, and those with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt; 60 ml/min/1.73 m(2) if there are concerns or symptoms of volume-related side effects. Issues remain with observed increases in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and the odds of heart attack and stroke. Canagliflozin offers a novel mechanism of action, a modest glycemic control, and a favorable side-effect profile. It was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration in April 2013 and is undergoing evaluation by the European Medicines Agency.",

Except for fluoxetine and flibanserin, all the antidepressants antagonized by different degrees the 5-CT inhibitory response with the following rank affinity order: mianserin &gt; maprotiline &gt; imipramine &gt; amitriptyline. Mianserin was the only antidepressant to show a profile of competitive antagonism at 5-HT7 receptors in a tenfold range of concentrations (0.1-1 microM), with an affinity (pA2) value of 8.1 +/- 0.6. The antagonism of the other antidepressants was not concentration-dependent (amitriptyline) or was associated with slight or moderate reduction of the maximal 5-CT response (imipramine or maprotiline). The apparent affinity (pKB) values were: amitriptyline, 7.0 +/- 0.2; maprotiline, 7.3 +/- 0.6; imipramine, 7.2 +/- 0.4. Our results show that various antidepressant drugs belonging to different chemical classes behave as antagonists at enteric 5-HT7 receptors through competitive or allosteric mechanisms. This evidence extends our previous findings demonstrating the interaction of antidepressants with other 5-HT receptors, namely 5-HT3 and 5-HT4 receptors.",

        "title": "Therapeutic potential of aleglitazar, a new dual PPAR-alpha/gamma agonist: implications for cardiovascular disease in patients with diabetes mellitus.",
        "abstract": "Preventing morbidity and mortality from diabetes mellitus is of paramount importance as the incidence of this disease is increasing across the world. While microvascular complications of diabetes such as nephropathy, retinopathy, and neuropathy are reduced with intensive glycemic control, treatment of hyperglycemia has not been consistently shown to have effects on the macrovascular complications of diabetes such as coronary artery, cerebrovascular, and peripheral vascular disease. Preventive efforts have accordingly shifted toward the modification of other cardiovascular risk factors in diabetic patients. Agonism of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) has long been an attractive target for antidiabetic therapy due to the role of PPARs in glycemic control and lipid metabolism. PPAR-alpha agonists such as rosiglitazone and pioglitazone are used in clinical practice for the treatment of diabetes, and there is some evidence that pioglitazone may have positive effects on cardiovascular complications by virtue of its favorable effects on lipid profiles. However, they have not been shown to reduce macrovascular events. PPAR-alpha agonism is the mechanism of action in the fibrate class of medications; these agents have been shown to increase high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels, reduce triglyceride levels, and improve cardiovascular outcomes. Given the prevalence of lipid abnormalities in patients with diabetes, dual PPAR-alpha/gamma agonists (glitazars) could potentially benefit patients with diabetes. A phase II trial examining a novel dual PPAR agonist, aleglitazar, showed that therapy with this agent reduced hyperglycemia and favorably modified levels of HDL-C and triglycerides with an acceptable safety profile. Aleglitazar is currently being studied in large-scale clinical trials to assess whether it will reduce the risk of major cardiovascular endpoints (death, myocardial infarction, or stroke) among patients with diabetes and coronary artery disease. If ongoing studies confirm the theoretical benefit and safety of dual PPAR-alpha/gamma agonism, aleglitazar may become the first therapy demonstrated to reduce macrovascular complications in patients with diabetes.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Perospirone is a second-generation antipsychotic (SGA) used only in Japan, and acts as a serotonin (5-HT)1A receptor partial agonist, 5-HT2A receptor inverse agonist, and dopamine (D)2, D4, and alpha1-adrenergic receptor antagonist. To our knowledge, no meta-analysis addressing the efficacy and effectiveness of perospirone in schizophrenia has been published to date. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to identify the characteristics of perospirone by assessing the efficacy, discontinuation rate, and side effects of perospirone versus other antipsychotics in the treatment of patients with schizophrenia. METHODS: Using information obtained from the PubMed, PsycINFO, Google Scholar and Cochrane Library databases without language restrictions published up to 10 June 2013, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of patient data from randomized controlled trials comparing perospirone with other antipsychotic medications. Risk ratio (RR), standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. All studies used the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) for the evaluation of the schizophrenia psychopathology. RESULTS: The search in PubMed, Cochrane Library databases, Google Scholar and PsycINFO yielded 69 hits. We included three studies in the current meta-analysis and excluded 66 studies based on title, abstract, and full text review. Moreover, two additional studies were identified from a review article. Across the five studies (mean duration 9.6 weeks), 562 adult patients with schizophrenia were randomized to perospirone (n = 256), olanzapine (n = 20), quetiapine (n = 28), risperidone (n = 53), aripiprazole (n = 49), haloperidol (n = 75), or mosapramine (n = 81). Perospirone was not different from other pooled antipsychotics regarding reduction in PANSS negative (SMD = 0.38, p = 0.09) and general (SMD = 0.28, p = 0.06) subscale scores, and discontinuation due to any cause (RR = 1.03, p = 0.83), inefficacy (RR = 0.99, p = 0.98) and side effects (RR = 0.72, p = 0.25). However, perospirone was inferior to other pooled antipsychotics in the reduction of PANSS total scores (SMD = 0.36, p = 0.04) and positive subscale scores (SMD = 0.34, p = 0.03). Moreover, excluding the comparison of perospirone with the first-generation antipsychotic (haloperidol), perospirone was inferior to other pooled SGAs in the reduction of PANSS total scores (SMD = 0.46, p = 0.02), positive (SMD = 0.42, p = 0.03), negative (SMD = 0.52, p = 0.02) and general subscale scores (SMD = 0.37, p = 0.03). However, perospirone was superior to haloperidol in the reduction of PANSS negative subscale scores (SMD = -0.41, p = 0.01). Perospirone also had lower scores related to extrapyramidal symptoms than other pooled antipsychotics (SMD = -0.30, p = 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that although perospirone seems to be a well tolerated treatment, perospirone does not reduce PANSS score as much as other SGAs.",

        "abstract": "In the modern era of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), reluctance to perform transplantation (Tx) in HIV-infected individuals is no longer justified. Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) or protease inhibitors (PIs), the current first line regimens of HAART, are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 family (CYP3A4). Most NNRTIs induce CYP3A4, whereas PIs inhibit it. Calcinuerin inhibitors (CNIs), which are mandatory for Tx, need the same enzyme complex for their clearance. Therefore, a significant drug-drug interaction (DDI) is encountered between current HAART and CNIs. This results in extreme difficulty in adjusting the optimal dose of CNIs, for which the therapeutic range is narrow. Of interest, integrase inhibitors (INIs) - novel, potent anti-HIV drugs - are mainly metabolized by uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) 1A1 and do not induce or inhibit CYP3A4. DDI is presumably absent when NNTRIs or PIs are replaced by INIs. Raltegravir (RAL), a first generation INI, has been introduced into kidney and liver Tx. There is increasing evidence that rejection is well controlled without renal impairment due to CNI over-exposure while persistent, robust suppression of HIV is achieved. Global phase III clinical trials of dolutegravir (DTG), a second generation INI, are currently in progress. In vitro data has suggested that DTG may be less prone to resistance than RAL (referred to as having a higher genetic barrier).

        "abstract": "Multiple myeloma is a common plasma cell neoplasm that is incurable with conventional therapy. The treatment paradigm of multiple myeloma is not standardized and is evolving. The advent of novel drugs, including the proteasome inhibitor bortezomib and the immunomodulatory agents, has resulted in increased median survival. Unfortunately, all patients eventually relapse and require further therapy. Pomalidomide is the newest immunomodulatory drug, created by chemical modification of thalidomide with the intention of increasing therapeutic activity while limiting toxicity. Its mechanism of action is incompletely understood but involves anti-angiogenic effects, immunomodulation, an effect on the myeloma tumor microenvironment, and the protein cereblon. It is more potent than thalidomide and lenalidomide. In phase II studies, it has shown significant activity in patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma, including patients who are heavily pretreated, have disease refractory to lenalidomide and bortezomib, and those with high-risk cytogenetic or molecular markers. It is generally well tolerated, with adverse effects including fatigue, neutropenia, neuropathy, and thromboembolic disease. Pomalidomide is a promising new agent in the expanding arsenal of antimyeloma drugs. In this review, we discuss the clinical experience to date with pomalidomide in multiple myeloma.",

        "abstract": "Oxytocin (OT) plays an important role in the onset of human labour by stimulating uterine contractions and promoting prostaglandin/inflammatory cytokine synthesis in amnion via oxytocin receptor (OTR) coupling. The OTR-antagonist, Atosiban, is widely used as a tocolytic for the management of acute preterm labour. We found that in primary human amniocytes, Atosiban (10 muM) signals via PTX-sensitive Galphai to activate transcription factor NF-kappaB p65, ERK1/2, and p38 which subsequently drives upregulation of the prostaglandin synthesis enzymes, COX-2 and phospho-cPLA2 and excretion of prostaglandins (PGE2) (n = 6; p &lt; 0.05, ANOVA). Moreover, Atosiban treatment increased expression and excretion of the inflammatory cytokines, IL-6 and CCL5. We also showed that OT-simulated activation of NF-kappaB, ERK1/2, and p38 and subsequent prostaglandin and inflammatory cytokine synthesis is via Galphai-2 and Galphai-3 but not Galphaq, and is not inhibited by Atosiban. Activation or exacerbation of inflammation is not a desirable effect of tocolytics. Therefore therapeutic modulation of the OT/OTR system for clinical management of term/preterm labour should consider the effects of differential G-protein coupling of the OTR and the role of OT or selective OTR agonists/antagonists in activating proinflammatory pathways.",

        "title": "The oxytocin receptor antagonist atosiban inhibits cell growth via a \"biased agonist\" mechanism.",
        "abstract": "In human myometrial cells, the promiscuous coupling of the oxytocin receptors (OTRs) to G(q) and G(i) leads to contraction. However, the activation of OTRs coupled to different G protein pathways can also trigger opposite cellular responses, e.g. OTR coupling to G(i) inhibits, whereas its coupling to G(q) stimulates, cell proliferation. Drug analogues capable of promoting a selective receptor-G protein coupling may be of great pharmacological and clinical importance because they may target only one specific signal transduction pathway. Here, we report that atosiban, an oxytocin derivative that acts as a competitive antagonist on OTR/G(q) coupling, displays agonistic properties on OTR/G(i) coupling, as shown by specific (35)S-labeled guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio) trisphosphate ([(35)S]GTPgammaS) binding. Moreover, atosiban, by acting on a G(i)-mediated pathway(,) inhibits cell growth of HEK293 and Madin-Darby canine kidney cells stably transfected with OTRs and of DU145 prostate cancer cells expressing endogenous OTRs. Notably, atosiban leads to persistent ERK1/2 activation and p21(WAF1/CIP1) induction, the same signaling events leading to oxytocin-mediated cell growth inhibition via a G(i) pathway. Finally, atosiban exposure did not cause OTR internalization and led to only a modest decrease (20%) in the number of high affinity cell membrane OTRs, two observations consistent with the finding that atosiban did not lead to any desensitization of the oxytocin-induced activation of the G(q)-phospholipase C pathway. Taken together, these observations indicate that atosiban acts as a \"biased agonist\" of the human OTRs and thus belongs to the class of compounds capable of selectively discriminating only one among the multiple possible active conformations of a single G protein-coupled receptor, thereby leading to the selective activation of a unique intracellular signal cascade.",

We determined and compared the human receptor binding affinities and functional characteristics of asenapine and several antipsychotic drugs. Compounds were tested under comparable assay conditions using cloned human receptors. In comparison with the antipsychotics, asenapine showed high affinity and a different rank order of binding affinities (pKi) for serotonin receptors (5-HT1A [8.6], 5-HT1B [8.4], 5-HT2A [10.2], 5-HT2B [9.8], 5-HT2C [10.5], 5-HT5 [8.8], 5-HT6 [9.6] and 5-HT7 [9.9]), adrenoceptors (alpha1 [8.9], alpha2A [8.9], alpha2B [9.5] and alpha2C [8.9]), dopamine receptors (D1 [8.9], D2 [8.9], D3 [9.4] and D4 [9.0]) and histamine receptors (H1 [9.0] and H2 [8.2]). It had much lower affinity (pKi&lt;or=5) for muscarinic receptors and was the only agent with affinity for H2 receptors. Relative to its D2 receptor affinity, asenapine had a higher affinity for 5-HT2C, 5-HT2A, 5-HT2B, 5-HT7, 5-HT6, alpha2B and D3 receptors, suggesting stronger engagement of these targets at therapeutic doses. Asenapine behaved as a potent antagonist (pKB) at 5-HT1A (7.4), 5-HT1B (8.1), 5-HT2A (9.0), 5-HT2B (9.3), 5-HT2C (9.0), 5-HT6 (8.0), 5-HT7 (8.5), D2 (9.1), D3 (9.1), alpha2A (7.3), alpha2B (8.3), alpha2C (6.8) and H1 (8.4) receptors. These functional effects differed from those of risperidone (pKB&lt;5 for 5-HT6) and olanzapine (pKB&lt;5 for 5-HT1A and alpha2).

        "abstract": "Dolutegravir is a second-generation integrase strand transfer inhibitor (INSTI) currently under review by the US Food and Drug Administration for marketing approval. The in vitro, protein-adjusted 90 % inhibitory concentration (IC90) of dolutegravir for wild-type virus is 0.064 mug/ml, and it retains in vitro anti-HIV 1 activity across a broad range of viral phenotypes that are known to confer resistance to the currently marketed INSTIs, raltegravir and elvitegravir. Dolutegravir has a terminal elimination half-life of 13-14 h and maintains concentrations over the in vitro, protein-adjusted IC90 for more than 30 h following a single dose. Additionally, dolutegravir has low inter-subject variability compared with raltegravir and elvitegravir. A plasma exposure-response relationship has been well described, with antiviral activity strongly correlating with trough concentrations. Phase III trials have assessed the antiviral activity of dolutegravir compared with efavirenz and raltegravir in antiretroviral (ARV)-naive patients and found that dolutegravir achieved more rapid and sustained virologic suppression in both instances. Additionally, studies of dolutegravir activity in patients with known INSTI-resistant mutations have been favourable, indicating that dolutegravir retains activity in a variety of INSTI-resistant phenotypes. Much like currently marketed INSTIs, dolutegravir is very well tolerated. Because dolutegravir inhibits the renal transporter organic cation transporter 2, reduced tubular secretion of creatinine leads to non-progressive increases in serum creatinine. These serum creatinine increases have not been associated with a decreased glomerular filtration rate or progressive renal impairment. Dolutegravir's major and minor metabolic pathways are uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase 1A1 and cytochrome P450 (CYP)-3A4, respectively, and it neither induces nor inhibits CYP isoenzymes. Thus dolutegravir has a modest drug interaction profile. However, antacids significantly decrease dolutegravir plasma exposure and should be separated by 2 h before, or 6 h after, a dolutegravir dose. In summary, dolutegravir is the first of the second-generation INSTIs and exhibits a predictable pharmacokinetic profile and a well-defined exposure-response relationship. Dolutegravir retains activity despite the presence of some class-resistant mutations and achieves rapid and sustained virologic suppression in ARV-naive and ARV-experienced patients. Clinically, dolutegravir is poised to become a commonly used component of antiretroviral regimens.",

METHODS: Acid alpha-glucosidase activities in dried blood spot extracts were determined fluorometrically using the artificial substrate 4-methylumbelliferyl-alpha-D-pyranoside. Acarbose or maltose was used to inhibit maltase-glucoamylase, an enzyme present in polymorphonuclear neutrophils that contributes to the total alpha-glucosidase activity at acidic pH. RESULTS: Complete discrimination between patients with proven infantile Pompe disease (n = 20), obligate heterozygotes (n = 16), and controls (n = 150) was achieved using 8 micromol/L acarbose as the inhibitor. Higher acarbose concentration (80 micromol/L) did not improve the assay. By using 4 mM maltose as the inhibitor, heterozygotes and patients were not completely separated. The results using acarbose compared well with those using the skin fibroblast assay in the same group of patients with proven infantile Pompe disease. CONCLUSION: Acid alpha-glucosidase activity measurements in dried blood spot extracts can reliably detect infantile Pompe disease in patients. The convenience of collecting and shipping dried blood specimens plus rapid turnaround time makes this assay an attractive alternative to established methods.",

Etizolam and triazolam inhibited the specific binding of 3H-PAF to PAF receptor sites on washed rabbit platelets with IC50 values of 22 nM and 320 nM, respectively.

Over the concentration range of the binding plateau (0.1 to 0.8 mug/ml), [14C]benzylpenicillin significantly inhibited formation of functional penicillin-binding proteins, but had comparatively little effect on total bacterial protein synthesis. The data suggest that penicillin covalently bound to the cells in a chemically stable manner alone is not sufficient to inhibit formation of functional binding proteins and that unbound penicillin in the growth medium is necessary. The concentration of unbound antibiotic in the culture medium, in turn, is a function of the cell-bound penicillinase activity whose significance increases with cell density. [14C]Cephapirin, a cephalosporin resistant to this cell-bound penicillinase almost completely inhibited the formation of functional Cephapirin-binding proteins, but had relatively little effect on total protein synthesis. At concentrations 250-fold higher than that required to inhibit formation of functional binding proteins.

        "abstract": "Epilepsy is the most common neurological disorder, with over 50 million people worldwide affected. Recent evidence suggests that the transient receptor potential cation channel subfamily V member 1 (TRPV1) may contribute to the onset and progression of some forms of epilepsy. Since the two nonpsychotropic cannabinoids cannabidivarin (CBDV) and cannabidiol (CBD) exert anticonvulsant activity in vivo and produce TRPV1-mediated intracellular calcium elevation in vitro, we evaluated the effects of these two compounds on TRPV1 channel activation and desensitization and in an in vitro model of epileptiform activity. Patch clamp analysis in transfected HEK293 cells demonstrated that CBD and CBDV dose-dependently activate and rapidly desensitize TRPV1, as well as TRP channels of subfamily V type 2 (TRPV2) and subfamily A type 1 (TRPA1). TRPV1 and TRPV2 transcripts were shown to be expressed in rat hippocampal tissue. When tested on epileptiform neuronal spike activity in hippocampal brain slices exposed to a Mg(2+)-free solution using multielectrode arrays (MEAs), CBDV reduced both epileptiform burst amplitude and duration. The prototypical TRPV1 agonist, capsaicin, produced similar, although not identical effects. Capsaicin, but not CBDV, effects on burst amplitude were reversed by IRTX, a selective TRPV1 antagonist. These data suggest that CBDV antiepileptiform effects in the Mg(2+)-free model are not uniquely mediated via activation of TRPV1. However, TRPV1 was strongly phosphorylated (and hence likely sensitized) in Mg(2+)-free solution-treated hippocampal tissue, and both capsaicin and CBDV caused TRPV1 dephosphorylation, consistent with TRPV1 desensitization. We propose that CBDV effects on TRP channels should be studied further in different in vitro and in vivo models of epilepsy.",

These discrepancies were also observed when superoxide dismutase (SOD) was present to protect NO from inactivation by superoxide anion. Subsequent experiments showed that formation of L-citrulline by purified NO synthase was completely inhibited by 30 microM methylene blue (IC50 = 5.3 and 9.2 microM in the absence and presence of SOD, respectively), whereas guanylyl cyclase stimulated by S-nitrosoglutathione was far less sensitive to the drug (50% inhibition at approximately 60 microM, and maximal inhibition of 72% at 1 mM methylene blue). Experimental evidence indicated that oxidation of NADPH, tetrahydrobiopterin or reduced flavins does not account for the inhibitory effects of methylene blue.

We examined the mechanism of its depigmenting action in human melanocyte cultures. Arbutin inhibited the tyrosinase activity of cultured human melanocytes at noncytotoxic concentrations. It did not affect the expression of tyrosinase mRNA. Melanin production was inhibited significantly by arbutin, as determined by measuring eumelanin radicals with an electron spin resonance spectrometer. The study of the kinetics and mechanism for inhibition of tyrosinase confirms the reversibility of arbutin as a competitive inhibitor of this enzyme. The utilization of L-tyrosine or L-dopa as the substrate suggests a mechanism involving competition with arbutin for the L-tyrosine binding site at the active site of tyrosinase.

        "abstract": "alpha 2-Adrenergic receptor agonists are widely used in veterinary medicine as sedative/hypnotic agents. Four pharmacological subtypes of the alpha 2-adrenergic receptor (A, B, C and D) have been identified based primarily on differences in affinity for several drugs. The purpose of this study was to examine the affinities of the sedative agents, xylazine, detomidine and medetomidine at the four alpha 2-adrenergic receptor subtypes. Saturation and inhibition binding curves were performed in membranes of tissues containing only one subtype of alpha 2-adrenergic receptor. The KD for the alpha 2-adrenergic receptor radioligand, [3H]-MK-912, in HT29 cells (alpha 2A-), neonatal rat lung (alpha 2B-), OK cells (alpha 2C-) and PC12 cells transfected with RG20 (alpha 2D-) were 0.38 +/- 0.08 nM, 0.70 +/- 0.5 nM. 0.07 +/- 0.02 nM and 0.87 +/- 0.03 nM, respectively. Detomidine and medetomidine had approximately a 100 fold higher affinity for all the alpha 2-adrenergic receptors compared to xylazine but neither agonist displayed selectivity for the alpha 2-adrenergic receptor subtypes. These data suggest that available sedative/hypnotic alpha 2-adrenergic receptor agonists can not discriminate between the four known alpha 2-adrenergic receptor subtypes.",

The data are far superior to those obtained for the enzyme in aqueous solution and allow us to identify species on the reaction pathway and to measure the rates of the accumulation and decay of these species. A key intermediate on the reaction pathway is an acyl enzyme formed between Ser70 and the lactam ring's C=O group. By using the E166A deacylation deficient variant of the enzyme, we were able to focus on the process of acyl enzyme formation. The Raman data show that all three inhibitors form an enamine-type acyl enzyme reaching maximal populations at 10, 22, and 29 min for sulbactam, clavulanic acid, and tazobactam, respectively. The enamine intermediate exhibits a characteristic and relatively intense band near 1595 cm(-1) due to a stretching motion of the O=C-C=C-NH moiety that shifts to lower frequency upon NH &lt;--&gt; ND exchange. This feature was used to follow the kinetics of enamine buildup and decay in the crystal. Quantum mechanical calculations support the assignment of the 1595 cm(-1) band, as well as several other bands, to a trans-enamine species. The Raman data also demonstrate that the lactam ring opens prior to enamine formation since the lactam ring carbonyl (C=O) peak disappears prior to the appearance of the enamine 1595 cm(-1) band. Tazobactam appears to form approximately twice as much enamine intermediate as sulbactam and clavulanic acid, which correlates with its superior performance in the clinic, a finding that may bear on future drug design.",

Rupatadine competitively inhibited histamine-induced guinea pig ileum contraction (pA2 = 9.29 +/- 0.06) without affecting contraction induced by ACh, serotonin or leukotriene D4 (LTD4). It also competitively inhibited PAF-induced platelet aggregation in washed rabbit platelets (WRP) (pA2 = 6.68 +/- 0.08) and in human platelet-rich plasma (HPRP) (IC50 = 0.68 microM), while not affecting ADP- or arachidonic acid-induced platelet aggregation. Rupatadine blocked histamine- and PAF-induced effects in vivo, such as hypotension in rats (ID50 = 1.4 and 0.44 mg/kg i.v., respectively) and bronchoconstriction in guinea pigs (ID50 = 113 and 9.6 micrograms/kg i.v.). Moreover, it potently inhibited PAF-induced mortality in mice (ID50 = 0.31 and 3.0 mg/kg i.v. and p.o., respectively) and endotoxin-induced mortality in mice and rats (ID50 = 1.6 and 0.66 mg/kg i.v.). Rupatadine's duration of action was long, as assessed by the histamine- and PAF-induced increase in vascular permeability test in dogs (42 and 34% inhibition at 26 h after 1 mg/kg p.o.). Rupatadine at a dose of 100 mg/kg p.o. neither modified spontaneous motor activity nor prolonged barbiturate-sleeping time in mice, which indicates a lack of sedative effects. Overall, rupatadine combines histamine and PAF antagonist activities in vivo with high potency, the antihistamine properties being similar to or higher than those of loratadine, whereas rupatadine's PAF antagonist effects were near those of WEB-2066. Rupatadine is therefore a good candidate for further development in the treatment of allergic and inflammatory conditions in which both PAF and histamine are implicated.",

Proteasome activity decreases with cellular senescence, aging, and age-related diseases. Therefore, enhancement of impaired proteasome function by molecular biological and/or pharmacological intervention is an active area of research. Bryostatin-1, a naturally occurring macrocyclic lactone, activates PKC isozymes (specifically, -alpha and -epsilon) at sub-nanomolar concentrations, but downregulates at higher concentrations. Here, we present bryostatin-1 increased chymotrypsin-like proteasome activity of 20S assembly at sub-nanomolar to nanomolar concentrations (0.3-30 nM). However, proteasome activity decreased at a micromolar concentration of bryostatin-1 (AG08044 cultured skin: P &lt; 0.005; differentiated SH-SY5Y cells: P &lt; 0.02). Modulation of proteasome function by bryostatin-1 was studied in six dermal fibroblast primary cell lines developed both from freshly taken biopsies from healthy donors (n = 2) and obtained from well-characterized cell repositories (n = 4; without any diseases). Bryostatin-1 enhanced proteasome activity in cultured skin fibroblasts obtained from banked and freshly isolated skin fibroblasts from skin biopsies at the sub-nanomolar concentration (P &lt; 0.015). Modulation of proteasome function by bryostatin-1 was confirmed in neuron-like differentiated SH-SY5Y cells. Direct additions of bryostatin-1 into cell lysates prepared from neuron-like differentiated SH-SY5Y, Jurkat cells, and cultured skin fibroblasts were unable to increase proteasome activity indicating that bryostatin-1 can only modulate proteasome activity when added to live cell culture systems. Standard PKC inhibitors blocked bryostatin-1 induced proteasome activity modulation suggesting that enhancement of proteasome activity was mediated by PKC modulation.",

        "abstract": "Eluxadoline, an orally active mixed mu opioid receptor (muOR) agonist delta opioid receptor (deltaOR) antagonist developed for the treatment of diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome, normalizes gastrointestinal (GI) transit and defecation under conditions of novel environment stress or post-inflammatory altered GI function. Furthermore, compared to loperamide, which is used to treat non-specific diarrhea, the effects of eluxadoline on GI transit occur over a wider dosage range. However, the mechanisms of action of eluxadoline are unclear. In this study, we compared the ability of eluxadoline and loperamide to activate G-protein- and beta-arrestin-mediated signaling at muOR homomers or muOR-deltaOR heteromers in heterologous cells. We also examined the ability of both compounds to reduce castor oil induced diarrhea in wild type (WT) and mice lacking deltaOR. We find that eluxadoline is more potent than loperamide in eliciting G-protein activity and beta-arrestin recruitment in muOR expressing cells. However, in cells expressing muOR-deltaOR heteromers, the potency of eluxadoline is higher, but its maximal effect is lower than that of loperamide. Moreover, in these cells the signaling mediated by eluxadoline but not loperamide is reduced by muOR-deltaOR heteromer-selective antibodies. We find that in castor oil-induced diarrhea eluxadoline is more efficacious compared to loperamide in WT mice, and deltaOR appears to play a role in this process. Taken together these results indicate that eluxadoline behaves as a potent muOR agonist in the absence of deltaOR, while in the presence of deltaOR eluxadoline's effects are mediated through the muOR-deltaOR heteromer.",

        "abstract": "Current pharmacological treatments of depression and related disorders suffer from major problems, such as a low rate of response, slow onset of therapeutic effects, loss of efficacy over time and serious side effects. Therefore, there is an urgent need to explore new therapeutic approaches that address these issues. Interestingly, the atypical antidepressant tianeptine already meets in part these clinical goals. However, in spite of three decades of basic and clinical investigations, the molecular target of tianeptine, as well as its mechanism of action, remains elusive. Herein, we report the characterization of tianeptine as a mu-opioid receptor (MOR) agonist. Using radioligand binding and cell-based functional assays, including bioluminescence resonance energy transfer-based assays for G-protein activation and cAMP accumulation, we identified tianeptine as an efficacious MOR agonist (K(i Human) of 383+-183 nM and EC(50 Human) of 194+-70 nM  and EC(50 Mouse) of 641+-120 nM for G-protein activation). Tianeptine was also a full delta-opioid receptor (DOR) agonist, although with much lower potency (EC(50 Human) of 37.4+-11.2 muM and EC(50 Mouse) of 14.5+-6.6  muM for G-protein activation). In contrast, tianeptine was inactive at the kappa-opioid receptor (KOR, both human and rat). On the basis of these pharmacological data, we propose that activation of MOR (or dual activation of MOR and DOR) could be the initial molecular event responsible for triggering many of the known acute and chronic effects of this agent, including its antidepressant and anxiolytic actions.",

        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: To review the pharmacology, pharmacokinetics, efficacy, and safety of apricitabine, a nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor that is currently under investigation and has fast-track approval status with the Food and Drug Administration. DATA SOURCES: A literature search was conducted using PubMed (1966-June 2009) to retrieve relevant material using the search terms apricitabine, SPD754, and AVX754. References from selected articles were evaluated to identify other pertinent trials. Information was also obtained from the manufacturer. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: All English-language in vitro and in vivo studies and abstracts evaluating apricitabine were reviewed and considered for inclusion. Preference was given to human data. DATA SYNTHESIS: Apricitabine is a prodrug that is phosphorylated to its active triphosphate form intracellularly, which ultimately results in chain termination and inhibition of reverse transcription. Apricitabine is administered orally, displays linear pharmacokinetics, and is renally excreted with minimal to no hepatic metabolism. It has demonstrated antiretroviral activity against drug-resistant strains both in vitro and in vivo. In clinical studies, in both antiretroviral-naive and treatment-experienced patients, apricitabine achieved the primary endpoint of significant reductions in plasma viral load versus comparator. Further Phase 2 and 3 studies are currently enrolling. Safety analysis indicates that apricitabine is well tolerated and has a low potential for causing mitochondrial damage. The most common adverse events reported include headache and rhinitis. Development of resistance or further gene mutations has not been shown in clinical studies to date. CONCLUSIONS: Although the role of apricitabine in the treatment of HIV-1 infection has yet to be established, its activity against resistant HIV-1 strains and its tolerability profile will likely make it a viable second-line treatment option in patients who have failed regimens containing lamivudine or emtricitabine.",

        "abstract": "Lasofoxifene is a new and potent selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM). The structural basis of its interaction with the estrogen receptor has been investigated by crystallographic analysis of its complex with the ligand-binding domain of estrogen receptor alpha at a resolution of 2.0 A. As with other SERMs, lasofoxifene diverts the receptor from its agonist-bound conformation by displacing the C-terminal AF-2 helix into the site at which the LXXLL motif of coactivator proteins would otherwise be able to bind. Lasofoxifene achieves this effect by occupying the space normally filled by residue Leu 540, as well as by modulating the conformation of residues of helix 11 (His 524, Leu 525). A well-defined salt bridge between lasofoxifene and Asp 351 suggests that charge neutralization in this region of the receptor may explain the some of the antiestrogenic effects of lasofoxifene. The results suggest general features of ERalpha/SERM recognition, and add a new dimension to efforts to rationalize differences between the biological activity profiles exhibited by these important pharmacological agents.",

The expression of P-gp on the surface of CD34+ cells from healthy human marrow was examined by flow cytometry. The multidrug resistance reversal agent MS-209 was used to measure the effects of MS-209 on the Rhodamin-123 uptaking of CD34+ hematopoietic cells. By using methylcellulose semi-solid culture, normal human granulocyte-macrophage clonal formation unit (CFU-GM) was cultured. The changes in CFU-GM inhibitory rate caused by daunorubicin were determined in the presence or absence of MS-209. The results showed that the P-gp expression rate of bone marrow CD34+ cells was 13.3%. MS-209 obviously increased the Rhodamin-123 uptake of CD34+ positive cells. The mean inhibitory rate of daunorubicin for CFU-GM was 29.6%, but it was increased to 43.3% in the presence of MS-209 with the difference being significant (P &lt; 0.05). It was concluded that hematopoietic cells expressed P-gp protein and possessed active function. MS-209 could inhibit the membrane efflux pump and increase the cytotoxicity of chemotherapy drugs to the clonal growth of hematopoetic stem cells, suggesting the side effects of these drugs on the hematopoietic system should be taken into consideration in the clinical use.",

The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of a single dose of HM30181 on the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of loperamide, a P-gp substrate, and to compare them with those of quinidine. METHODS: Eighteen healthy male subjects were administered loperamide alone (period 1) or with loperamide plus quinidine or HM30181 in period 2 or 3, respectively. In period 3, subjects randomly received one of three HM30181 doses: 15, 60 or 180 mg. Changes in pupil size, alertness, oxygen saturation and the oral bioavailability of loperamide were assessed in each period. In addition, the pharmacokinetics of HM30181 were determined. RESULTS: Pupil size, alertness and oxygen saturation did not change over time when loperamide alone or loperamide plus HM30181 was administered while HM30181 significantly increased the systemic exposure to loperamide, i.e. the geometric mean ratio (90% confidence interval) of AUC(0,tlast ) for loperamide with and without HM30181 was 1.48 (1.08, 2.02). Co-administered quinidine significantly increased the systemic exposure to loperamide 2.2-fold (1.53, 3.18), which also markedly reduced pupil size, resulting in a decrease of 24.7 mm h in the area under the effect curve of pupil size change from baseline compared with loperamide alone. CONCLUSIONS: HM30181 inhibits P-gp mainly in the intestinal endothelium, which can be beneficial because pan-inhibition of P-gp, particularly in the brain, could lead to detrimental adverse events. Further studies are warranted to investigate adequately the dose-exposure relationship of HM30181, along with its duration of effect.",

In particular, it bound with high affinity (Ki &lt; 1 nM) to human serotonin 1A (h5-HT1A)-, h5-HT2A-, long form of human D2 (hD2L)-, halpha1B-, and halpha2C-adrenergic receptors. It displayed partial agonism at h5-HT1A and hD2 receptors in cloned receptor systems and potent antagonism of h5-HT2A receptors and halpha1B/2C-adrenoceptors. Brexpiprazole also had affinity (Ki &lt; 5 nM) for hD3-, h5-HT2B-, h5-HT7-, halpha1A-, and halpha1D-adrenergic receptors, moderate affinity for hH1 (Ki = 19 nM), and low affinity for hM1 receptors (Ki &gt; 1000 nM). Brexpiprazole potently bound to rat 5-HT2A and D2 receptors in vivo, and ex vivo binding studies further confirmed high 5-HT1A receptor binding potency. Brexpiprazole inhibited DOI (2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine)-induced head twitches in rats, suggestive of 5-HT2A antagonism. Furthermore, in vivo D2 partial agonist activity of brexpiprazole was confirmed by its inhibitory effect on reserpine-induced DOPA accumulation in rats. In rat microdialysis studies, brexpiprazole slightly reduced extracellular dopamine in nucleus accumbens but not in prefrontal cortex, whereas moderate increases of the dopamine metabolites, homovanillic acid and DOPAC (3,4-dihydroxy-phenyl-acetic acid), in these areas also suggested in vivo D2 partial agonist activity. In particular, based on a lower intrinsic activity at D2 receptors and higher binding affinities for 5-HT1A/2A receptors than aripiprazole, brexpiprazole would have a favorable antipsychotic potential without D2 receptor agonist- and antagonist-related adverse effects. In conclusion, brexpiprazole is a serotonin-dopamine activity modulator with a unique pharmacology, which may offer novel treatment options across a broad spectrum of central nervous system disorders.",

Plasma renin activity was significantly increased by cilazapril therapy, but there were no changes in plasma concentrations of Ang II or atrial natriuretic factor. We conclude that cilazapril, an ACE inhibitor, does not alter alpha 1-adrenoceptor and Ang II receptor sensitivity to selective agonists, nor does it affect baroreflex sensitivity.",

        "abstract": "Benzoic acid, 2-(acetyl-oxy)-3-[(nitrooxy)methyl]phenyl ester (NCX 4016), a new drug made by an aspirin molecule linked, through a spacer, to a nitric oxide (NO)-donating moiety, is now under clinical testing for the treatment of atherothrombotic conditions. Aspirin exerts its antithrombotic activity by irreversibly inactivating platelet cyclooxygenase (COX)-1. NCX 4016 in vivo undergoes metabolism into deacetylated and/or denitrated metabolites, and it is not known whether NCX 4016 needs to liberate aspirin to inhibit COX-1, or whether it can block it as a whole molecule. The aim of our study was to evaluate the effects of NCX 4016 and its analog or metabolites on platelet COX-1 and whole blood COX-2 and on purified ovine COX (oCOX)-1 and oCOX-2. In particular, we have compared the mechanism by which NCX 4016 inhibits purified oCOX enzymes with that of aspirin using a spectrophotometric assay. All the NCX 4016 derivatives containing acetylsalicylic acid inhibited the activity of oCOX-1 and oCOX-2, whereas the deacetylated metabolites and the nitric oxide-donating moiety were inactive. Dialysis experiments showed that oCOX-1 inhibition by NCX 4016, similar to aspirin, is irreversible. Reversible COX inhibitors (indomethacin) or salicylic acid incubated with the enzyme before NCX 4016 prevent the irreversible inhibition of oCOX-1 by NCX 4016 as well as by aspirin. In conclusion, our data show that NCX 4016 acts as a direct and irreversible inhibitor of COX-1 and that the presence of a spacer and NO-donating moiety in the molecule slows the kinetics of COX-1 inhibition by NCX 4016, compared with aspirin.",

        "abstract": "Endogenous 17 beta-estradiol (E2) and low parenteral doses of exogenous E2 are vasodilators. High dose estrogens, especially ethinylestradiol (EE) and mestranol, stimulate the synthesis of hepatic proteins including coagulation factors, sex hormone binding globulin, and angiotensinogen (Aogen). In the steady state, high plasma levels of Aogen produce only a very small increase of angiotensin II (AII) and plasma renin activity, because AII inhibits the secretion of renin and lowers plasma renin concentration. However, the increase in AII is sufficient for a slight reduction in renal blood flow and a slight increase in exchangeable sodium and blood pressure; in susceptible women, blood pressure may rise considerably. Effects of estrogens on the brain may also be involved in blood pressure changes. Endogenous progesterone is a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist. Endogenous or exogenous progesterone leads to sodium loss and a compensatory increase in renin secretion, plasma renin activity, AII, and plasma aldosterone, e.g. in the second half of the menstrual cycle. Synthetic progestogens are commonly devoid of the mineralocorticoid receptor antagonistic effect of progesterone, and some are weak estrogen receptor agonists. Combined use of EE and synthetic progestogens may therefore enhance estrogen effects on body sodium and blood pressure. A new progestogen (Drospirenone) with an antimineralocorticoid effect like that of progesterone is described that slightly lowers body weight and blood pressure in a contraceptive formulation together with EE. An almost ideal oral contraceptive would be progestogen like Drospirenone together with a low dose natural estrogen that does not stimulate Aogen synthesis. Since most oral formulations for postmenopausal estrogen replacement also stimulate hepatic protein synthesis (including Aogen) to some extent, the transdermal route of E2 application for contraceptive purposes should also be investigated, since it has reduced potential for undesirable side effects.",

        "abstract": "Multidrug resistance (MDR) is a common cause of failure in chemotherapy for malignant diseases. MDR is either acquired as a result of previous repeated exposure to cytostatic drugs (P388/MDR cells) or naturally, as some tumors are congenitally resistant to chemotherapy (CT26 cells). One of the most common mechanisms of MDR is upregulation of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) expression. Here, we used HPMA copolymer conjugates, whereby the cytostatic drug doxorubicin (Dox) or the derivative of the P-gp inhibitor reversin 121 (R121) or both were covalently bound through a degradable pH-sensitive hydrazone bond. We proved that R121, when bound to a polymeric carrier, is capable of inhibiting P-gp in P388/MDR cells and sensitizing them in relation to the cytostatic activity of Dox. Conjugate bearing both Dox and R121 was found to be far more potent in P388/MDR cells than conjugate bearing Dox alone or a mixture of conjugates bearing either Dox or R121 when cytostatic activity in vitro, cell cycle arrest, accumulation of Dox in cells and induction of apoptosis were determined. Importantly, conjugate bearing R121 is also effective in vivo as it inhibits P-gp in P388/MDR tumors after intraperitoneal administration, while both the conjugate bearing Dox and R121 induces apoptosis in P388/MDR tumors more effectively than conjugate bearing Dox alone. Only conjugate bearing Dox and R121 significantly inhibited P388/MDR tumor growth and led to the prolonged survival of treated mice. However, the most dramatic antitumor activity of this conjugate was found in the CT26 tumor model where it completely cured six out of eight experimental mice, while conjugate bearing Dox alone cured no mice.",

This specific pharmacological profile of drospirenone is defined by its pattern of binding affinities to a variety of steroid hormone receptors. In the present study the affinity of drospirenone to the progesterone receptor (PR), the androgen receptor (AR), the glucocorticoid receptor (GR), the mineralocorticoid receptor (MR), and the estrogen receptor (ER) was re-evaluated by steroid binding assays and compared to those obtained for the natural hormone progesterone. Drospirenone displayed high affinity to PR and MR and low binding to AR, similar to progesterone. Unlike progesterone, which showed considerable binding to GR, drospirenone exhibited only low binding to this receptor. Neither drospirenone nor progesterone did bind to the ER. In addition to receptor binding studies, transactivation assays were carried out to investigate the effects of drospirenone and progesterone on AR-, GR-, and MR-mediated induction of transcription. Both progestins showed no androgenic but antiandrogenic activity by inhibiting AR-mediated transcription in a dose-dependent manner. This observation could be confirmed by in vivo experiments carried out with orchiectomized male rats, where the antiandrogenic potency of drospirenone was found to be about five- to ten-fold higher than that of progesterone. In contrast to progesterone, drospirenone was devoid of glucocorticoid activity. Both progestins did not show any antiglucocorticoid action. Furthermore, drospirenone and progesterone both showed considerable antimineralocorticoid activity and weak mineralocorticoid activity.",

Progressive amyloid accumulation leads to multiorgan dysfunction and death. Inotersen, a 2'- O-methoxyethyl-modified antisense oligonucleotide, inhibits hepatic production of transthyretin. METHODS: We conducted an international, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 15-month, phase 3 trial of inotersen in adults with stage 1 (patient is ambulatory) or stage 2 (patient is ambulatory with assistance) hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis with polyneuropathy. Patients were randomly assigned, in a 2:1 ratio, to receive weekly subcutaneous injections of inotersen (300 mg) or placebo. The primary end points were the change in the modified Neuropathy Impairment Score+7 (mNIS+7; range, -22.3 to 346.3, with higher scores indicating poorer function; minimal clinically meaningful change, 2 points) and the change in the score on the patient-reported Norfolk Quality of Life-Diabetic Neuropathy (QOL-DN) questionnaire (range, -4 to 136, with higher scores indicating poorer quality of life). A decrease in scores indicated improvement. RESULTS: A total of 172 patients (112 in the inotersen group and 60 in the placebo group) received at least one dose of a trial regimen, and 139 (81%) completed the intervention period. Both primary efficacy assessments favored inotersen: the difference in the least-squares mean change from baseline to week 66 between the two groups (inotersen minus placebo) was -19.7 points (95% confidence interval [CI], -26.4 to -13.0; P<0.001) for the mNIS+7 and -11.7 points (95% CI, -18.3 to -5.1; P<0.001) for the Norfolk QOL-DN score. These improvements were independent of disease stage, mutation type, or the presence of cardiomyopathy. There were five deaths in the inotersen group and none in the placebo group. The most frequent serious adverse events in the inotersen group were glomerulonephritis (in 3 patients [3%]) and thrombocytopenia (in 3 patients [3%]), with one death associated with one of the cases of grade 4 thrombocytopenia. Thereafter, all patients received enhanced monitoring. CONCLUSIONS: Inotersen improved the course of neurologic disease and quality of life in patients with hereditary transthyretin amyloidosis. Thrombocytopenia and glomerulonephritis were managed with enhanced monitoring. (Funded by Ionis Pharmaceuticals; NEURO-TTR ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01737398 .).",

Consequently, developing or identifying modulators of ABCB1 and ABCG2 that are suitable for clinical practice is of great importance. Therefore, we have explored the drug repositioning approach to identify candidate modulators of ABCB1 and ABCG2 from tyrosine kinase inhibitors with known pharmacological properties and anticancer activities. In this study, we discovered that avapritinib (BLU-285), a potent, selective, and orally bioavailable tyrosine kinase inhibitor against mutant forms of KIT and platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRA), attenuates the transport function of both ABCB1 and ABCG2. Moreover, avapritinib restores the chemosensitivity of ABCB1- and ABCG2-overexpressing MDR cancer cells at nontoxic concentrations. These findings were further supported by results of apoptosis induction assays, ATP hydrolysis assays, and docking of avapritinib in the drug-binding pockets of ABCB1 and ABCG2. Altogether, our study highlights an additional action of avapritinib on ABC drug transporters, and a combination of avapritinib with conventional chemotherapy should be further investigated in patients with MDR tumors.",

        "abstract": "Recently we have shown that heparin and related sulfated polyanions are low-affinity ligands of the kringle domain in the amino-terminal region (ATF) of human urokinase (u-PA), and proposed that this may facilitate loading of u-PA onto its receptor at the focal contacts between adherent cells and their matrix. We have now tested other components of the cell matrix (fibronectin, vitronectin, thrombospondin and laminin-nidogen) for u-PA binding, and found that laminin-nidogen is also a ligand of the u-PA ATF. Direct binding assays and competition binding assays with defined fragments of laminin-nidogen showed that there are u-PA binding sites in fragment E4 of laminin as well as in nidogen. The long-arm terminal domain of laminin (fragment E3), which contains a heparin-binding site, competed for binding of u-PA to immobilised heparin. However nidogen, which does not bind to heparin, also inhibited binding of u-PA to heparin, and this effect was also observed with recombinant nidogen and with a fragment of nidogen lacking the carboxy-terminal domain. Direct binding assays confirmed that u-PA binds to nidogen through a site in the u-PA ATF. We conclude that u-PA binds to laminin-nidogen by interactions involving the ATF region of u-PA, the E4 domain of laminin and the rod or amino-terminal regions of nidogen. Since nidogen is suggested to be an important bridging molecule in the maintenance of the supramolecular organization in basement membranes, the presence of a binding site for u-PA in nidogen indicates a role for plasminogen activation in basement membrane remodelling.",

Its reported side effects, however, make it unappealing for long-term administration, and resistance may also develop. To overcome this, second-generation PIs became available. Here, we investigated whether a novel class of peptide epoxyketone-based PIs, including carfilzomib, N-((S)-3-methoxy-1-(((S)-3-methoxy-1-(((S)-1-((R)-2-methyloxiran-2-yl)-1-oxo-3-phenylpropan-2-yl)amino)-1-oxopropan-2-yl)amino)-1-oxopropan-2-yl)-2-methylthiazole-5-carboxamide (ONX0912), and (S)-3-(4-methoxyphenyl)-N-((S)-1-((S)-2-methyloxiran-2-yl)-1-oxo-3-phenylpropan-2-yl)-2-((S)-2-(2-morpholinoacetamido)propanamido)propanamide (ONX0914), might escape two established BTZ-resistance mechanisms: 1) mutations in the proteasome beta5 subunit (PSMB5) targeted by these PIs, and 2) drug efflux mediated by ATP-binding cassette transporters. THP1 myeloid sublines with acquired resistance to BTZ (54- to 235-fold) caused by mutations in the PSMB5 gene displayed marked cross-resistance but less pronounced cross-resistance to carfilzomib (9- to 32-fold), ONX0912 (39- to 62-fold), and ONX0914 (27- to 97-fold). As for ATP-binding cassette transporter-mediated efflux, lymphoid CEM/VLB cells with P-glycoprotein (Pgp)/multidrug resistance 1 overexpression exhibited substantial resistance to carfilzomib (114-fold), ONX0912 (23-fold), and ONX0914 (162-fold), whereas less resistance to BTZ (4.5-fold) was observed. Consistently, beta5 subunit-associated chymotrypsin-like proteasome activity was significantly less inhibited in these CEM/VLB cells. Ex vivo analysis of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from therapy-naive patients with rheumatoid arthritis revealed that, although basal Pgp levels were low, P-glycoprotein expression compromised the inhibitory effect of carfilzomib and ONX0914. However, the use of P121 (reversin 121), a Pgp transport inhibitor, restored parental cell inhibitory levels in both CEM/VLB cells and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. These results indicate that the pharmacologic activity of these PIs may be hindered by drug resistance mechanisms involving PSMB5 mutations and PI extrusion via Pgp.",

        "abstract": "Deregulation of the cell cycle is a hallmark of cancer, and research on cell cycle control has allowed identification of potential targets for anticancer treatment. Palbociclib is a selective inhibitor of the cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6), which are involved, with their coregulatory partners cyclin D, in the G1-S transition. Inhibition of this step halts cell cycle progression in cells in which the involved pathway, including the retinoblastoma protein (Rb) and the E2F family of transcription factors, is functioning, although having been deregulated. Among breast cancers, those with functioning cyclin D-CDK4/6-Rb-E2F are mainly hormone-receptor (HR) positive, with some HER2-positive and rare triple-negative cases. Deregulation results from genetic or otherwise occurring hyperactivation of molecules subtending cell cycle progression, or inactivation of cell cycle inhibitors. Based on results of randomized clinical trials, palbociclib was granted accelerated approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in combination with letrozole as initial endocrine-based therapy for metastatic disease in postmenopausal women with HR-positive, HER2-negative breast cancer, and was approved for use in combination with fulvestrant in women with HR-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer with disease progression following endocrine therapy. This review provides an update of the available knowledge on the cell cycle and its regulation, on the alterations in cyclin D-CDK4/6-Rb-E2F axis in breast cancer and their roles in endocrine resistance, on the preclinical activity of CDK4/6 inhibitors in breast cancer, both as monotherapy and as partners of combinatorial synergic treatments, and on the clinical development of palbociclib in breast cancer.",

Lanadelumab (DX-2930) is a new kallikrein inhibitor with the potential for prophylactic treatment of hereditary angioedema with C1 inhibitor deficiency. METHODS: We conducted a phase 1b, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-ascending-dose trial. Patients with hereditary angioedema with C1 inhibitor deficiency were randomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive either lanadelumab (24 patients) or placebo (13 patients), in two administrations 14 days apart. Patients assigned to lanadelumab were enrolled in sequential dose groups: total dose of 30 mg (4 patients), 100 mg (4 patients), 300 mg (5 patients), or 400 mg (11 patients). The pharmacodynamic profile of lanadelumab was assessed by measurement of plasma levels of cleaved high-molecular-weight kininogen, and efficacy was assessed by the rate of attacks of angioedema during a prespecified period (day 8 to day 50) in the 300-mg and 400-mg groups as compared with the placebo group. RESULTS: No discontinuations occurred because of adverse events, serious adverse events, or deaths in patients who received lanadelumab. The most common adverse events that emerged during treatment were attacks of angioedema, injection-site pain, and headache. Dose-proportional increases in serum concentrations of lanadelumab were observed; the mean elimination half-life was approximately 2 weeks. Lanadelumab at a dose of 300 mg or 400 mg reduced cleavage of high-molecular-weight kininogen in plasma from patients with hereditary angioedema with C1 inhibitor deficiency to levels approaching that from patients without the disorder. From day 8 to day 50, the 300-mg and 400-mg groups had 100% and 88% fewer attacks, respectively, than the placebo group. All patients in the 300-mg group and 82% (9 of 11) in the 400-mg group were attack-free, as compared with 27% (3 of 11) in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: In this small trial, administration of lanadelumab to patients with hereditary angioedema with C1 inhibitor deficiency reduced cleavage of high-molecular-weight kininogen and attacks of angioedema.

        "title": "Adalimumab: a review of its use in rheumatoid arthritis.",
        "abstract": "Adalimumab (Humira) is a recombinant, fully human IgG1 monoclonal antibody that binds specifically to tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, thereby neutralizing the activity of the cytokine. Subcutaneous adalimumab has been investigated in well designed trials in patients with active rheumatoid arthritis despite treatment with disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs). Patients receiving adalimumab 40mg every other week in combination with methotrexate (Anti-TNF Research Study Program of the Monoclonal Antibody Adalimumab [ARMADA] and DE019 trials) or standard antirheumatic therapy (Safety Trial of Adalimumab in Rheumatoid Arthritis [STAR] trial) for 24-52 weeks had significantly higher American College of Rheumatology (ACR) 20, ACR50, and ACR70 response rates than patients receiving placebo plus methotrexate or standard antirheumatic therapy. In ARMADA, an ACR20 response was achieved in 25%, 52%, and 67% of adalimumab plus methotrexate recipients at weeks 1, 4, and 24, respectively. In ARMADA and DE019, improvements in the individual components of the ACR response were significantly greater with adalimumab 40mg every other week plus methotrexate than with placebo plus methotrexate. Monotherapy with adalimumab 40mg every other week was associated with significantly higher ACR20, ACR50, and ACR70 response rates than placebo, as well as significantly greater improvements in the individual components of the ACR response. ACR responses were sustained with adalimumab according to the results of extension studies in which patients received adalimumab in combination with methotrexate (up to 30 months) or as monotherapy (up to 5 years). In both concomitant therapy and monotherapy trials, adalimumab was associated with significantly greater improvements from baseline in health-related quality of life (HR-QOL) measures than placebo; adalimumab also retarded the radiographic progression of structural joint damage to a significant extent compared with placebo. Adalimumab was generally well tolerated as both concomitant therapy and monotherapy. In ARMADA, there were no significant differences between adalimumab and placebo (in combination with methotrexate) in the incidence of adverse events; however, in STAR, the incidence of injection site reactions, rash, and back pain was significantly higher with adalimumab than with placebo (in combination with standard antirheumatic therapy). No cases of tuberculosis were reported in either trial.In conclusion, subcutaneous adalimumab in combination with methotrexate or standard antirheumatic therapy, or as monotherapy, is effective in the treatment of adults with active rheumatoid arthritis who have had an inadequate response to DMARDs. Adalimumab has a rapid onset of action and sustained efficacy. The drug also retards the progression of structural joint damage, improves HR-QOL, and is generally well tolerated. Thus, adalimumab is a valuable new option for the treatment of DMARD-refractory adult rheumatoid arthritis.",

        "abstract": "It was recently demonstrated that mutations in the human SPTLC1 gene, encoding the Lcb1p subunit of serine palmitoyltransferase (SPT), cause hereditary sensory neuropathy type I . As a member of the subfamily of pyridoxal 5'-phosphate enzymes known as the alpha-oxoamine synthases, serine palmitoyltransferase catalyzes the committed step of sphingolipid synthesis. The residues that are mutated to cause hereditary sensory neuropathy type I reside in a highly conserved region of Lcb1p that is predicted to be a catalytic domain of Lcb1p on the basis of alignments with other members of the alpha-oxoamine synthase family. We found that the corresponding mutations in the LCB1 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae reduce serine palmitoyltransferase activity. These mutations are dominant and decrease serine palmitoyltransferase activity by 50% when the wild-type and mutant LCB1 alleles are coexpressed. We also show that serine palmitoyltransferase is an Lcb1p small middle dotLcb2p heterodimer and that the mutated Lcb1p proteins retain their ability to interact with Lcb2p. Modeling studies suggest that serine palmitoyltransferase is likely to have a single active site that lies at the Lcb1p small middle dotLcb2p interface and that the mutations in Lcb1p reside near the lysine in Lcb2p that is expected to form the Schiff's base with the pyridoxal 5'-phosphate cofactor. Furthermore, mutations in this lysine and in a histidine residue that is also predicted to be important for pyridoxal 5'-phosphate binding to Lcb2p also dominantly inactivate SPT similar to the hereditary sensory neuropathy type 1-like mutations in Lcb1p.",

        "abstract": "Central precocious puberty is commonly treated by gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists. To compare modes of action and effectiveness of GnRH analogues and assess treatment combinations of agonistic (triptorelin) and antagonistic (cetrorelix acetate) GnRH analogues with established treatment, we used prepubertal 31-d-old ovariectomized female rats. Strongest inhibition of LH and FSH occurred after 2-d treatment with antagonist alone (LH 0.08 +/- 0.02 versus 3.2 +/- 0.56 ng/mL in controls; FSH 10.8 +/- 2.8 versus 44.2 +/- 5.0 ng/mL in controls, p &lt; 0.001). Combined agonist/antagonist was second most effective of the treatments (after 5 d treatment, LH 0.52 +/- 0.15 versus 4.9 +/- 1.1 ng/mL in controls; p &lt; 0.01). Pituitary gonadotropin subunit LHbeta mRNA levels were inhibited in all groups except controls, but pituitary GnRH receptor mRNA was stimulated by agonist yet unaffected by combined analogues. Explanted ovaries were incubated with either analogue, both 10-6 M. After 4 h, GnRH receptor mRNA levels were significantly reduced by antagonist but not agonist. To verify puberty-inhibiting effects of GnRH analogues, we used 26-d-old female rats with androgen-induced precocious puberty after injecting subcutaneously single 300 microg danazol on postnatal d 5. Single application of cetrorelix depot (cetrorelix embonate) reduced serum estradiol levels and pituitary LHbeta expression; GnRH receptor mRNA levels were down-regulated in the pituitary and ovary (p &lt; 0.05). In androgen-induced precocious puberty model, single injection of antagonist effectively arrests premature hormonal activation and down-regulates pituitary and ovarian GnRH receptors. We conclude that GnRH analogue combination and especially antagonist alone treatment most directly suppress gonadotropin levels. This implies that early treatment gonadotropin flare-up associated with agonist treatment is avoidable.",

        "abstract": "Streptokinase activates platelets, limiting its effectiveness as a thrombolytic agent. The role of antistreptokinase antibodies and proteases in streptokinase-induced platelet activation was investigated. Streptokinase induced localization of human IgG to the platelet surface, platelet aggregation, and thromboxane A(2) production. These effects were inhibited by a monoclonal antibody to the platelet Fc receptor, IV.3. The platelet response to streptokinase was also blocked by an antibody directed against the cleavage site of the platelet thrombin receptor, protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1), but not by hirudin or an active site thrombin inhibitor, Ro46-6240. In plasma depleted of plasminogen, exogenous wild-type plasminogen, but not an inactive mutant protein, S(741)A plasminogen, supported platelet aggregation, suggesting that the protease cleaving PAR-1 was streptokinase-plasminogen. Streptokinase-plasminogen cleaved a synthetic peptide corresponding to PAR-1, resulting in generation of PAR-1 tethered ligand sequence and selectively reduced binding of a cleavage-sensitive PAR-1 antibody in intact cells. A combination of streptokinase, plasminogen, and antistreptokinase antibodies activated human erythroleukemic cells and was inhibited by pretreatment with IV.3 or pretreating the cells with the PAR-1 agonist SFLLRN, suggesting Fc receptor and PAR-1 interactions are necessary for cell activation in this system also. Streptokinase-induced platelet activation is dependent on both antistreptokinase-Fc receptor interactions and cleavage of PAR-1. (Blood. 2000;95:1301-1308)",

        "abstract": "We have characterized the binding parameters of renal receptors (Scatchard analysis revealed the presence of two binding sites: site I, Ka1 = 1.29 X 10(9) M-1, number of binding sites = 9.9 X 10(6)/micrograms protein; site II, Ka2 = 0.93 X 10(8) M-1, number of binding sites = 4.27 X 10(8)/micrograms protein) and studied the effect of solubilization. The high-affinity sites are preserved during affinity chromatography and the process results in a 6080-fold purification of those sites. The lower-affinity sites are also preserved but the overall purification factor is about 40% lower than that obtained using molecular sieving. The purification of the renal calcitonin receptor by molecular sieving (Sephacryl S-200) is accompanied by total loss of the high-affinity site; however, the low-affinity site is enriched over 1642-fold. Binding parameters were obtained for the purified fractions. Synthetic salmon calcitonin was also bound to renal membranes using the bifunctional reagent disuccinimidyl suberate and photo-affinity cross-linking using hydroxysuccinimidyl azidobenzonate reagent. Cross-linked receptor eluted in the same volume as solubilized membranes specifically binding salmon calcitonin (S-200 chromatography). Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of purified fractions showed several protein bands with apparent molecular masses ranging from 18 000 Da to 100 000 Da in the presence or absence of a reducing agent (2-mercaptoethanol). Autoradiography of polyacrylamide gels of cross-linked calcitonin receptor showed only three protein bands specifically binding salmon calcitonin. Their molecular masses were 70 000 Da, 40 000 Da and 33 000 Da respectively. The 40 000-Da molecule represents a major band (47% total binding species). This suggests that these three proteins are the principal components of the calcitonin receptor and that S-S bonds are not involved in the assembly of the receptor subunits.",

        "abstract": "Alterations in fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) genes have been identified as potential driver oncogenes. Pharmacological targeting of FGFRs may therefore provide therapeutic benefit to selected cancer patients, and proof-of-concept has been established in early clinical trials of FGFR inhibitors. Here, we present the molecular structure and preclinical characterization of INCB054828 (pemigatinib), a novel, selective inhibitor of FGFR 1, 2, and 3, currently in phase 2 clinical trials. INCB054828 pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics were investigated using cell lines and tumor models, and the antitumor effect of oral INCB054828 was investigated using xenograft tumor models with genetic alterations in FGFR1, 2, or 3. Enzymatic assays with recombinant human FGFR kinases showed potent inhibition of FGFR1, 2, and 3 by INCB054828 (half maximal inhibitory concentration [IC50] 0.4, 0.5, and 1.0 nM, respectively) with weaker activity against FGFR4 (IC50 30 nM). INCB054828 selectively inhibited growth of tumor cell lines with activation of FGFR signaling compared with cell lines lacking FGFR aberrations. The preclinical pharmacokinetic profile suggests target inhibition is achievable by INCB054828 in vivo with low oral doses. INCB054828 suppressed the growth of xenografted tumor models with FGFR1, 2, or 3 alterations as monotherapy, and the combination of INCB054828 with cisplatin provided significant benefit over either single agent, with an acceptable tolerability. The preclinical data presented for INCB054828, together with preliminary clinical observations, support continued investigation in patients with FGFR alterations, such as fusions and activating mutations.",

        "title": "Expression of receptors for luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone in human ovarian and endometrial cancers: frequency, autoregulation, and correlation with direct antiproliferative activity of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogues.",
        "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: Several recent reports have demonstrated the expression of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone receptors by human ovarian and endometrial cancers. Controversy persists on the relevance of this finding, in particular whether these receptors mediate direct antiproliferative effects of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogues. We correlated the expression of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone receptors by well-characterized ovarian and endometrial cancer cell lines with the ability of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogues to reduce their proliferation and studied the autoregulation of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone receptor expression by luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist triptorelin and antagonist cetrorelix. The expression of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone receptors was assessed in a series of specimens from primary ovarian and endometrial cancers. STUDY DESIGN: Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone receptor expression was assessed by semiquantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction and radioligand binding assay. Antiproliferative effects were ascertained by proliferation assays in the absence or presence of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogues. RESULTS: Ovarian (4/6 cell lines) and endometrial (5/6 cell lines) cancer cell lines expressed luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone receptors. The proliferation of these luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone receptor-positive cell lines was dose- and time-dependently reduced by agonistic and antagonistic luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogues. Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone receptor density was reduced to 80% of controls (control, 100 %; P &lt;.001) by luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogues. Seventy percent of primary ovarian cancers and 83% of primary endometrial cancers expressed luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone receptors. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone receptors that are expressed by human ovarian and endometrial cancer cell lines mediate direct antiproliferative effects of luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone analogues. Because most respective primary cancers expressed luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone receptors, these receptors might be used for novel antiproliferative therapeutic approaches and should be further evaluated.",

        "abstract": "On July 24, 2006, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration granted approval to pegaspargase (Oncaspar; Enzon Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Bridgewater, NJ; hereafter, O) for the first-line treatment of patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) as a component of a multiagent chemotherapy regimen. O was previously approved in February 1994 for the treatment of patients with ALL who were hypersensitive to native forms of L-asparaginase. The trial supporting this new indication was an open label, randomized, multicenter clinical trial that enrolled 118 children (age, 1-9 years) with previously untreated, standard risk ALL. Patients received either native Escherichia coli asparaginase (Elspar; Merck, Whitehouse Station, NJ; hereafter, E) or O along with multiagent chemotherapy during remission induction and delayed intensification (DI) phases of treatment. O, at a dose of 2,500 IU/m(2), was administered i.m. on day 3 of the 4-week induction phase and on day 3 of each of two 8-week DI phases. E, at a dose of 6,000 IU/m(2), was administered i.m. three times weekly for nine doses during induction and for six doses during each DI phase. This study allowed direct comparison of O and E for asparagine depletion, asparaginase activity, and development of asparaginase antibodies. An unplanned comparison of event-free survival (EFS) was conducted to rule out a deleterious O efficacy effect. Following induction and DI treatment there was complete (&lt;/=1 microM) or moderate (1-10 microM) depletion of serum asparagine levels in the large majority of samples tested over the 4-week period in both O-treated and E-treated subjects. Similarly, depletion of cerebrospinal fluid asparagine levels during induction was similar between O-treated and E-treated subjects. The number of days asparaginase activity exceeded &gt;0.03 IU/ml in O-treated subjects was greater than the number of days in E-treated subjects during both the induction and DI phases of treatment. There was no correlation, however, between asparaginase activity and serum asparagine levels, making the former determination less clinically relevant. Using the protocol-prespecified threshold for a positive result of &gt;2.5 times the control, 7 of 56 (12%) O subjects tested at any time during the study demonstrated antiasparaginase antibodies and 16 of 57 (28%) E subjects tested at any time during the study had antiasparaginase antibodies. In both study arms EFS was in the range of 80% at 3 years. The most serious, sometimes fatal, O toxicities were anaphylaxis, other serious allergic reactions, thrombosis (including sagittal sinus thrombosis), pancreatitis, glucose intolerance, and coagulopathy. The most common adverse events were allergic reactions (including anaphylaxis), hyperglycemia, pancreatitis, central nervous system thrombosis, coagulopathy, hyperbilirubinemia, and elevated transaminases.

        "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Acromegaly is known to be associated to vascular damage characterized by an increase of vascular wall thickness and an impairment of vascular function. AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of medical treatment with the GH receptor antagonist pegvisomant on vascular structure and function in acromegalic patients resistant to somatostatin analogues. PATIENTS: Ten patients (4 males and 6 females, 28-58 yr) and 20 sex-, age-, and body mass index-matched healthy controls entered the study. All patients were treated for 18 months with pegvisomant at doses ranging from 10 to 40 mg/day. OUTCOME MEASURES: Primary outcome measures were measurement of carotid arteries intima-media thickness (IMT), and brachial arteries flow mediated dilation (FMD); secondary outcome measures were blood pressure, blood glucose and lipids levels. RESULTS: Carotid arteries maximal IMT was significantly higher in patients than in controls at baseline (1.18+-0.59 vs 0.69+-0.13, p=0.001) and slightly, but not significantly, decreased after treatment (0.97+-0.17). Brachial arteries FMD was significantly lower in patients than controls at baseline (7.5+-2.5 vs 13.1+-1.4, p&lt;0.001) and significantly increased after treatment (8.8+-3.7, p=0.016). Systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure values, serum glucose and insulin levels and homeostasis model assessment (HOMA) index were higher, whereas HDL-cholesterol levels were lower in patients than controls at baseline. After treatment, SBP and DBP, as well as serum glucose and insulin levels and HOMA index significantly decreased whereas no significant change was found in serum lipid profile. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the current study suggested that long-term treatment with pegvisomant induced a slight reduction of carotid arteries wall thickness and a significant improvement of brachial arteries vascular function in patients with acromegaly resistant to somatostatin analogues.",

        "title": "An E460D Substitution in the NS5 Protein of Tick-Borne Encephalitis Virus Confers Resistance to the Inhibitor Galidesivir (BCX4430) and Also Attenuates the Virus for Mice.",
        "abstract": "The adenosine analogue galidesivir (BCX4430), a broad-spectrum RNA virus inhibitor, has entered a phase 1 clinical safety and pharmacokinetics study in healthy subjects and is under clinical development for treatment of Ebola and yellow fever virus infections. Moreover, galidesivir also inhibits the reproduction of tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) and numerous other medically important flaviviruses. Until now, studies of this antiviral agent have not yielded resistant viruses. Here, we demonstrate that an E460D substitution in the active site of TBEV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) confers resistance to galidesivir in cell culture. Galidesivir-resistant TBEV exhibited no cross-resistance to structurally different antiviral nucleoside analogues, such as 7-deaza-2'-C-methyladenosine, 2'-C-methyladenosine, and 4'-azido-aracytidine. Although the E460D substitution led to only a subtle decrease in viral fitness in cell culture, galidesivir-resistant TBEV was highly attenuated in vivo, with a 100% survival rate and no clinical signs observed in infected mice. Furthermore, no virus was detected in the sera, spleen, or brain of mice inoculated with the galidesivir-resistant TBEV. Our results contribute to understanding the molecular basis of galidesivir antiviral activity, flavivirus resistance to nucleoside inhibitors, and the potential contribution of viral RdRp to flavivirus neurovirulence.IMPORTANCE Tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV) is a pathogen that causes severe human neuroinfections in Europe and Asia and for which there is currently no specific therapy. We have previously found that galidesivir (BCX4430), a broad-spectrum RNA virus inhibitor, which is under clinical development for treatment of Ebola and yellow fever virus infections, has a strong antiviral effect against TBEV. For any antiviral drug, it is important to generate drug-resistant mutants to understand how the drug works. Here, we produced TBEV mutants resistant to galidesivir and found that the resistance is caused by a single amino acid substitution in an active site of the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, an enzyme which is crucial for replication of the viral RNA genome. Although this substitution led only to a subtle decrease in viral fitness in cell culture, galidesivir-resistant TBEV was highly attenuated in a mouse model. Our results contribute to understanding the molecular basis of galidesivir antiviral activity.",

        "abstract": "The widely employed anti-diabetic drug pioglitazone (Actos) is shown to be a specific and reversible inhibitor of human monoamine oxidase B (MAO B). The crystal structure of the enzyme-inhibitor complex shows the R-enantiomer is bound with the thiazolidinedione ring near the flavin. The molecule occupies both substrate and entrance cavities of the active site establishing non-covalent interactions with the surrounding amino acids. These binding properties differentiate pioglitazone from the clinically used MAO inhibitors, which act through covalent inhibition mechanisms and do not exhibit a high degree of MAO A versus B selectivity. Rosiglitazone (Avandia) and troglitazone, other members of the glitazone class, are less selective in that they are weaker inhibitors of both MAO A and MAO B These results suggest that pioglitazone may have utility as a \"re-purposed\" neuro-protectant drug in retarding the progression of disease in Parkinson's patients. They also provide new insights for the development of reversible isoenzyme-specific MAO inhibitors.",

Cytosols or suspensions of H. pylori with or without specific concentrations of rhein co-treatment showed different percentages of 2-aminofluorene and p-aminobenzoic acid acetylation. The data indicate that there was decreased NAT activity associated with increased levels of rhein in H. pylori cytosols. Inhibition of growth studies from H. pylori demonstrated that rhein elicited dose-dependent bacteriostatic activity in H. pylori cultures: i.e. the greater the concentration of rhein, the greater the inhibition of growth to H. pylori. For the cytosol and intact bacteria examination, the apparent values of Km and Vmax were decreased after co-treatment with 40 microM rhein. This report is the first demonstration of rhein inhibition of arylamine N-acetyltransferase activity and rhein inhibition of growth in the bacterium H. pylori.",

        "abstract": "This article will review the clinical development of ibritumomab tiuxetan, a yttrium-90-conjugated monoclonal antibody to CD20, for patients with relapsed B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Ibritumomab is the murine parent anti-CD20 antibody that was engineered to make the human chimeric antibody rituximab. Tiuxetan is an MX-DTPA chelator that is linked to ibritumomab to form ibritumomab tiuxetan. Since yttrium-90 ((90)Y) is a pure beta emitter and cannot be used for patient imaging, indium-111 ((111)In) is chelated to ibritumomab tiuxetan for tumor and normal organ imaging in clinical practice and for dosimetry in clinical trials. (90)Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan is the form used for therapy. This review discusses the clinical trials that have demonstrated the efficacy of ibritumomab tiuxetan and summarizes the safety data in patients with relapsed B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Two phase I trials of (90)Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan were conducted to establish the toxicity profile and the maximum tolerated single dose that could be administered to outpatients without the use of stem cells or prophylactic growth factors. In the first trial, cold ibritumomab was used prior to ibritumomab tiuxetan; the second trial used the human chimeric antibody rituximab. The phase I trials determined that in patients with a platelet count of greater than or equal to 150 x 10(9)/l, a schedule of intravenous rituximab 250 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 8, and 0.4 mCi/ kg of intravenous (90)Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan on day 8 was safe and efficacious and did not require stem cells. A dose of 0.3 mCi/kg was recommended for patients with a baseline platelet count of 100,000- 149,000 x 10(6)/l. Adverse events were primarily hematologic, and nonhematologic adverse events were primarily due to rituximab. There was no normal organ toxicity. The overall response rate was 67% for all patients and 82% in patients with low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. A subsequent phase III trial randomized 143 eligible patients to either rituximab or ibritumomab tiuxetan. The aim was to demonstrate that the addition of the yttrium-90 radioisotope to the antibody provided additional efficacy over the unconjugated (\"cold\") rituximab alone. The results of this study showed an overall response rate of 80% with (90)Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan versus 56% for rituximab (p = 0.002). An additional trial enrolled 54 patients who were nonresponsive or refractory to rituximab and treated the patients with a single dose of 0.4 mCi/kg (90)Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan. An overall response rate of 74% was found in these rituximab-refractory patients. These data provide further evidence of the added value of the yttrium-90. Finally, a fifth trial treated 30 patients with mild thrombocytopenia using 0.3 mCi/kg (90)Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan and found an overall response rate of 83%. (90)Y-ibritumomab tiuxetan radioimmunotherapy is a new treatment modality for patients with relapsed B-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The advantages of this therapy are that it utilizes targeted radiation in a single-dose, outpatient schedule that is well tolerated and accepted by the patient. Future trials will build on these results and determine at what point in the disease course this modality can best be utilized to maximize the benefits to the patient.",

        "abstract": "Opioids such as morphine are commonly used analgesics in clinical practice. Three opioid receptors (mu, micro; delta, delta; and kappa, kappa) that mediate opioid effects have been identified by molecular cloning: delta (enkephalin-preferring), kappa (dynorphin-preferring), and micro (morphine and ss-endorphin-preferring) (1). Each type of opioid receptors consists of subtypes of receptors as suggested by pharmacological studies (2, 3). Their specificity and ubiquitous location are present in both the central and peripheral nervous system. The opioid receptors (G-protein coupled, resulting in decrease in adenylyl cyclase activity) play an important role in the regulation of analgesia, shock, appetite, thermoregulation, cardiovascular, mental and endocrine function (2-5). Although micro opioid receptors are the major receptor to mediate the analgesic effects of opioids, delta and kappa receptors are also important in antinociception. Opioids have been found to protect cells from ischemia injury in the heart and brain via the delta receptors. On the other hand, kappa antagonist prevents neurodegeneration. The micro opioid receptors are localized predominately in the hypothalamus and thalamus, and the delta opioid receptors are localized predominately in the striatum, limbic system, and cerebral cortex (6, 7). The kappa opioid receptors (kappa1 and kappa2 ) are the most abundant brain opioid receptors and are widely distributed in deeper layers of the neocortex (particularly temporal, parietal, and frontal cortices), striatum, amygdala, and thalamus, with lower levels in the hippocampus, occipital cortex, and cerebellum (8-10). The kappa opioid receptors have been implicated in several clinical brain disorders, including drug abuse (11), epilepsy (12), Tourette's syndrome (13), and Alzheimer's disease (14). Diprenorphine is a highly potent and nonselective opioid receptors antagonist with subnanomolar affinity (7). Diprenorphine has been labeled as [6-O-methyl-(11)C]diprenorphine ([(11)C]DPN) (15, 16). [(11)C]DPN is being developed as a PET agent for the non-invasive study of opioid receptors in the brain.",

        "abstract": "Remdesivir (GS-5734) is a 1'-cyano-substituted adenosine nucleotide analogue prodrug that shows broad-spectrum antiviral activity against several RNA viruses. This compound is currently under clinical development for the treatment of Ebola virus disease (EVD). While antiviral effects have been demonstrated in cell culture and in non-human primates, the mechanism of action of Ebola virus (EBOV) inhibition for remdesivir remains to be fully elucidated. The EBOV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) complex was recently expressed and purified, enabling biochemical studies with the relevant triphosphate (TP) form of remdesivir and its presumptive target. In this study, we confirmed that remdesivir-TP is able to compete for incorporation with adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Enzyme kinetics revealed that EBOV RdRp and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) RdRp incorporate ATP and remdesivir-TP with similar efficiencies. The selectivity of ATP against remdesivir-TP is ~4 for EBOV RdRp and ~3 for RSV RdRp. In contrast, purified human mitochondrial RNA polymerase (h-mtRNAP) effectively discriminates against remdesivir-TP with a selectivity value of ~500-fold. For EBOV RdRp, the incorporated inhibitor at position i does not affect the ensuing nucleotide incorporation event at position i+1. For RSV RdRp, we measured a ~6-fold inhibition at position i+1 although RNA synthesis was not terminated. Chain termination was in both cases delayed and was seen predominantly at position i+5. This pattern is specific to remdesivir-TP and its 1'-cyano modification. Compounds with modifications at the 2'-position show different patterns of inhibition. While 2'-C-methyl-ATP is not incorporated, ara-ATP acts as a non-obligate chain terminator and prevents nucleotide incorporation at position i+1. Taken together, our biochemical data indicate that the major contribution to EBOV RNA synthesis inhibition by remdesivir can be ascribed to delayed chain termination. The long distance of five residues between the incorporated nucleotide analogue and its inhibitory effect warrant further investigation.",

        "abstract": "Dexfenfluramine, a drug formerly prescribed for treatment of obesity, caused heart valve damage and pulmonary hypertension in some people. The cause of the toxicity has not been defined, but 5-HT has been implicated. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of the anorectic agent, d-fenfluramine, and its major metabolite, d-norfenfluramine, on intact human platelet serotonin (5-HT) transport in vitro. The effects of d-fenfluramine and d-norfenfluramine on platelet uptake and efflux of 3H-5-HT were measured in buffer at pH 6.7, to optimize serotonin transporter (SERT) function, and at pH 7.4. Uptake of 3H-5-HT at pH 6.7 and 7.4 was inhibited by both agents at micro m concentrations (IC50, d-fenfluramine approximately 3 microM; d-norfenfluramine approximately 10 microM). However, no efflux of 3H-5-HT from labeled platelets at either pH 6.7 or 7.4 occurred at similar concentrations of d-fenfluramine or d-norfenfluramine. With inhibition of platelet dense granule 3H-5-HT uptake by reserpine, efflux of 3H-5-HT was observed at pH 6, but not at pH 7.4. Fluoxetine, a SERT inhibitor, was a more potent inhibitor of uptake (IC50 0.05 microM) than d-fenfluramine, but the anorectic agent, phentermine, had no effect. Therefore, d-fenfluramine and d-norfenfluramine inhibit human platelet uptake of 5-HT in vitro at tissue concentrations attainable in vivo, but they do not stimulate 5-HT efflux due to dense granule sequestration. Inhibition of platelet 5-HT uptake may play a role in the cardiopulmonary toxicity of d-fenfluramine, but other factors probably contribute, since similar toxicity has not been observed with fluoxetine.",

        "title": "Duloxetine pharmacology: profile of a dual monoamine modulator.",
        "abstract": "Dysregulation within central monoaminergic systems is believed to underlie the pathology of depression. Drugs that selectively inhibit the reuptake of central monoamines have been used clinically to alleviate symptoms of depressive illnesses. Duloxetine, a novel compound currently under investigation for the treatment of depression, binds selectively with high affinity to both norepinephrine (NE) and serotonin (5-HT) transporters and lacks affinity for monoamine receptors within the central nervous system. It has been suggested that dual inhibition of monoamine reuptake processes may offer advantages over other antidepressants currently in use. In preclinical studies, duloxetine mimics many physiologic effects of antidepressants. Consistent with other antidepressants, duloxetine, by acute administration, elevates extracellular monoamine levels, while by chronic administration it does not alter basal monoamine levels. Like the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, fluoxetine, by microiontophoretic application, duloxetine inhibits neuronal cell firing. However, in comparison with fluoxetine, duloxetine is a more potent serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Furthermore, in behavioral experiments, duloxetine attenuates immobility in forced swim tests in animal models of depression to a greater extent than several other commonly used antidepressants. In a six-week open label uncontrolled study, duloxetine was evaluated in patients with a history of depression. Duloxetine was effective in treating depression as determined by marked reduction in Hamilton Depression Rating scores. Adverse effects reported during duloxetine treatment were minor and similar to those of other antidepressants. In an eight-week multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in patients with a major depressive disorder, duloxetine was effective as an antidepressant, particularly in patients with greater symptom severity. Only limited data are available regarding the pharmacokinetic profile of duloxetine in humans, although a half-life of 10 to 15 h has been reported. Studies conducted in healthy human subjects confirm the preclinical profile of duloxetine as an inhibitor of 5-HT and NE reuptake. Taken together, existing data suggest that duloxetine is a novel and effective antidepressant.",

First-generation reversible epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibition (TKI) has paved the way for targeted treatment in lung cancer. These drugs result in excellent responses in patients with activating EGFR mutations. Unfortunately, resistance often develops. Second-generation irreversible inhibitors hope to prevent mutational progression to a resistant clone or delay the use of alternative non-targeted therapies. AREAS COVERED: This article focuses on the current published ongoing research using the second-generation irreversible TKI, dacomitinib . The use of dacomitinib, a pan inhibitor of the HER family of tyrosine kinases, will be reviewed along with its efficacy in the advanced or metastatic NSCLC population. EXPERT OPINION: Data available suggest dacomitinib is effective in NSCLC patients both in initial treatment and after failure of first-generation inhibitors. Furthermore, preclinical data suggest dacomitinib can achieve responses in tumors harboring the T790M, gatekeeper mutation, present in up to 50% of tumors that have acquired resistant to first-generation inhibitors. Its usefulness in potentially delaying development of resistant clones as well as in combination with other targeting strategies is under investigation.",

        "abstract": "Brain tryptophan concentrations are increased by various stressful treatments, an effect that can be prevented by beta-adrenoceptor antagonists. This study aimed to determine the beta-adrenergic subtype responsible for the tryptophan response. Male CD-1 mice received intraperitoneal injections of nonselective and subtype-selective beta-adrenergic antagonists 20 min before subtype-selective beta-agonists. Selected brain regions were dissected for analysis of tryptophan content by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. The beta(2)-selective agonist clenbuterol (0.3 mg/kg) induced increases in brain tryptophan that reached a peak ( approximately 60%) 1 h following injection and small but statistically significant increases ( approximately 20%) in 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid: serotonin ratios 2 h following injection. The beta(1)-selective agonist dobutamine (10 mg/kg) produced less robust increases ( approximately 40%) in brain tryptophan, whereas the beta(3)-selective agonists BRL 37344 (0.2 mg/kg (+/-)-(R*,R*)-[4-[2-[[2-(3-chlorophenyl)-2-hydroxyethyl]amino)propyl] phenoxy]acetic acid sodium)) and CL 316243 [0.1 mg/kg disodium 5-[(2R)-2-([(2R)-2-(3-chlorophenyl)-2-hydroxyethyl]amino)propyl]-1,3-benzodioxole-2,2-dicarboxylate)] resulted in larger increases (80 to 100%). Pretreatment with the beta(2)-selective antagonist ICI 118551 (0.5 mg/kg (+/-)-1-[2,3-(dihydro-7-methyl-1H-inden-4-yl)oxyl]-3-[(1-methylethyl)amino]-2-butanol) attenuated the increases in tryptophan induced by both clenbuterol (0.1 mg/kg) and dobutamine (10 mg/kg). Pretreatment with the beta(1/2)-selective antagonist propranolol (2.5 mg/kg), the beta(3)-selective antagonist SR 59230A [1.5, 2.5, 5, or 20 mg/kg (3-(2-ethylphenoxy)-1[1S)-1,2,3,4-tertahydronaphth-1-yl-amino]-(2S)-2-propanol oxalate)], or ICI 118551 (0.5 mg/kg) did not prevent the BRL 37344-induced increase in brain tryptophan, whereas the beta(1/2/3)-antagonist bupranolol (10 mg/kg) attenuated it. CL 316243 had no effect on brain tryptophan in beta(3)-receptor knockout mice, whereas clenbuterol increased brain tryptophan, indicating that beta-adrenergic modulation of brain tryptophan occurs in the absence of beta(3)-receptors. We conclude that activation of either beta(2)- or beta(3)-adrenergic receptors, but not beta(1)-adrenergic receptors, increases mouse brain tryptophan content.",

METHODS: Inhibition of the serotonin transporter (5-HTT) was studied in COS-1 cells expressing the human 5-HTT (h-5-HTT) and in rat brain synaptosomes. In vitro selectivity was studied relative to noradrenaline transporter (NAT) and dopamine transporter (DAT) function in rat brain synaptosomes, and affinities for other binding sites were determined. In vivo 5-HT activity was measured as inhibition of neuronal firing rate in rat dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN) and enhancement of 5-hydroxytryptophan (5-HTP)-induced behaviour (mouse and rat). Furthermore, studies were conducted in models of antidepressant (mouse forced-swim test), anxiolytic [foot-shock-induced ultrasonic vocalization (USV) in adult rats and mouse black and white box] and anti-aggressive activity (socially isolated mice). RESULTS: Escitalopram inhibited 5-HTT functions approximately 2 times more potently than citalopram and at least 40 times more potently than R-citalopram. Escitalopram showed insignificant activity at other monoamine transporters and 144 other binding sites. Escitalopram inhibited 5-HT neuronal firing in DRN and potentiated 5-HTP-induced behaviours more potently than citalopram; R-citalopram was inactive. Escitalopram and citalopram, but not R-citalopram, reduced forced-swimming-induced immobility and facilitated exploratory behaviour in the black and white box. Escitalopram and citalopram inhibited USV potently; R-citalopram was several times less potent. Escitalopram, citalopram and R-citalopram inhibited aggressive behaviour weakly. Escitalopram and citalopram had very potent anti-aggressive effects when co-administered with l-5-HTP. CONCLUSION: Escitalopram is a very selective 5-HT reuptake inhibitor. It is more potent than its racemate citalopram and is effective in animal models predictive of antidepressant and anxiolytic activities.",

DVS (30 mg/kg orally) significantly increased extracellular NE levels compared with baseline in the male rat hypothalamus but had no effect on DA levels using microdialysis. To mimic chronic selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment and to block the inhibitory 5-HT(1A) autoreceptors, a 5-HT(1A) antagonist, N-[2-[4-(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl]ethyl]-N-2-pyridinylcyclo hexanecarboxamide maleate salt (WAY-100635) (0.3 mg/kg s.c.), was administered with DVS (30 mg/kg orally). 5-HT increased 78% compared with baseline with no additional increase in NE or DA levels. In conclusion, DVS is a new 5-HT and NE reuptake inhibitor in vitro and in vivo that demonstrates good brain-to-plasma ratios, suggesting utility in a variety of central nervous system-related disorders.",

        "abstract": "Ethambutol (EMB) is an antimycobacterial drug used extensively for the treatment of tuberculosis caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis. EMB targets the biosynthesis of the cell wall, inhibiting the synthesis of both arabinogalactan and lipoarabinomannan (LAM), and is assumed to act via inhibition of three arabinosyltransferases: EmbA, EmbB, and EmbC. EmbA and EmbB are required for the synthesis of arabinogalactan, and at least one enzyme (M. tuberculosis EmbA [EmbA(Mt)]) is essential in M. tuberculosis. EmbC(Mt) is also essential for the viability of M. tuberculosis but is involved in the synthesis of LAM. We show that mutations in EmbC(Mt) that reduce its arabinosyltransferase activity result in increased sensitivity to EMB and the production of smaller LAM species in M. tuberculosis. Overexpression of EmbC(Mt) was not tolerated in M. tuberculosis, but overexpression of Mycobacterium smegmatis EmbC (EmbC(Ms)) led to EMB resistance and the production of larger LAM species in M. tuberculosis. Treatment of wild-type M. tuberculosis strains with EMB led to inhibition of LAM synthesis, resulting in the production of smaller species of LAM. In contrast, no change in LAM production was seen in EMB-resistant strains. Overexpression of EmbB(Ms) in M. tuberculosis also resulted in EMB resistance, but at a lower level than that caused by EmbC(Ms). Overexpression of EmbA(Mt) in M. tuberculosis had no effect on EMB resistance. Thus, there is a direct correlation between EmbC activity and EMB resistance, as well as between EmbC activity and the size of the LAM species produced, confirming that EmbC is one of the cellular targets of EMB action.",

        "abstract": "Aggregation of the alpha-chain of the high affinity IgE receptor (Fc epsilon RI alpha) on mast cells or basophils after cross-linking of receptor-bound IgE by its antigen or an anti-IgE antibody results in cell activation and release of inflammatory mediators. Omalizumab (Xolair), Novartis Pharmaceuticals; Genentech Inc.) is a recombinant humanized anti-IgE mAb developed for the treatment of severe allergic asthma. It complexes with free serum IgE, which prevents its binding to Fc epsilon RI and thereby interrupts the allergic cascade. Administration of an inhibitory anti-Fc epsilon RI alpha mAb may represent an alternative strategy to neutralize IgE-mediated receptor activation. In the present report, for the first time, we have performed direct side of side comparison between the inhibitory anti-Fc epsilon RI alpha mAb designated 15/1 and Omalizumab for their effects on human cord blood-derived mast cells. We provide the first evidence that both 15/1 mAb and Omalizumab efficiently inhibit Fc epsilon RI-mediated human mast cell responses in vitro (degranulation, activation, release of IL-8 and IL-13, phosphorylation of Akt) and that mAb 15/1 is a non-anaphylactogenic antibody, which compared to Omalizumab, displays markedly higher inhibitory potency in the presence of high IgE levels.",

        "title": "Clinical pharmacokinetics and selective pharmacodynamics of new angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors: an update.",
        "abstract": "The angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are widely used in the management of essential hypertension, stable chronic heart failure, myocardial infarction (MI) and diabetic nephropathy. There is an increasing number of new agents to add to the nine ACE inhibitors (benazepril, cilazapril, delapril, fosinopril, lisinopril, pentopril, perindopril, quinapril and ramipril) reviewed in this journal in 1990. The pharmacokinetic properties of five newer ACE inhibitors (trandolapril, moexipril, spirapril, temocapril and imidapril) are reviewed in this update. All of these new agents are characterised by having a carboxyl functional groups and requiring hepatic activation to form pharmacologically active metabolites. They achieve peak plasma concentrations at similar times (t(max)) to those of established agents. Three of these agents (trandolapril, moexipril and imidapril) require dosage reductions in patients with renal impairment. Dosage reductions of moexipril and temocapril are recommended for elderly patients, and dosages of moexipril should be lower in patients who are hepatically impaired. Moexipril should be taken 1 hour before meals, whereas other ACE inhibitors can be taken without regard to meals. The pharmacokinetics of warfarin are not altered by concomitant administration with trandolapril or moexipril. Although imidapril and spirapril have no effect on digoxin pharmacokinetics, the area under the concentration-time curve of imidapril and the peak plasma concentration of the active metabolite imidaprilat are decreased when imidapril is given together with digoxin. Although six ACE inhibitors (captopril, enalapril, fosinopril, lisinopril, quinapril and ramipril) have been approved for use in heart failure by the US Food and Drug Administration, an overview of 32 clinical trials of ACE inhibitors in heart failure showed that no significant heterogeneity in mortality was found among enalapril, ramipril, quinapril, captopril, lisinopril, benazepril, perindopril and cilazapril. Initiation of therapy with captopril, ramipril, and trandolapril at least 3 days after an acute MI resulted in all-cause mortality risk reductions of 18 to 27%. Captopril has been shown to have similar morbidity and mortality benefits to those of diuretics and beta-blockers in hypertensive patients. Captopril has been shown to delay the progression of diabetic nephropathy, and enalapril and lisinopril prevent the development of nephropathy in normoalbuminuric patients with diabetes. ACE inhibitors are generally characterised by flat dose-response curves. Lisinopril is the only ACE inhibitor that exhibits a linear dose-response curve. Despite the fact that most ACE inhibitors are recommended for once-daily administration, only fosinopril, ramipril, and trandolapril have trough-to-peak effect ratios in excess of 50%.",

        "title": "Paroxetine : a review of its pharmacology and therapeutic potential in the management of panic disorder.",
        "abstract": "SYNOPSIS: Paroxetine is the first selective serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) to be approved for the treatment of patients with panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. It is a highly selective inhibitor of presynaptic serotonin reuptake and does not interact with adrenergic, dopaminergic, histaminergic or serotonergic receptors to any significant extent.                 Oral paroxetine 10 to 60 mg/day is significantly more effective than placebo in reducing the frequency of panic attacks and improving associated symptoms, as shown in short term trials in patients with panic disorder with or without agoraphobia. The efficacy of the drug was maintained during up to 6 months'; treatment, and continued therapy reduced the risk of relapse. Oral paroxetine 10 to 60 mg/day was at least as effective as clomipramine 10 to 150 mg/day, but appeared to have a more rapid onset of effect, in a placebo-controlled trial.                 The tolerability profile of paroxetine is similar to that established for other SSRIs and is characterised by adverse events such as nausea, headache, somnolence, dry mouth, tremor, insomnia, asthenia, sweating, constipation, dizziness and sexual dysfunction. Paroxetine was better tolerated overall than clomipramine and was associated with a lower incidence of certain anticholinergic events (such as dry mouth and constipation) in a comparative trial. It is not associated with the type of dependence seen with benzodiazepines, and it appears to be safer in overdose than the tricyclic antidepressants. Paroxetine 20 or 30mg does not significantly impair psychomotor function or interact with alcohol (ethanol).                 In conclusion, the good tolerability profile of paroxetine, including lack of dependence potential and relative safety in overdose, makes it attractive for the treatment of patients with panic disorder. It appears to be at least as effective as clomipramine in reducing panic attacks and associated symptoms. Although further trials to compare the efficacy and tolerability of paroxetine with that of other tricyclic agents (especially Imipramine), high-potency benzodiazepines and monoamine oxidase inhibitors are needed, the drug appears to have the potential to become a first-line treatment for panic disorder. PHARMACODYNAMIC PROPERTIES: Paroxetine increases serotonergic neurotransmission by inhibiting presynaptic reuptake of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-HT) and thereby increasing the level of the neurotransmitter at the synaptic cleft. In vitro, it is a more potent inhibitor of serotonin uptake than the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) Citalopram, fluvoxamine and fluoxetine. Paroxetine was more potent than sertraline in one study that compared mean inhibition constants for serotonin uptake, but not in another study that compared the concentrations required to inhibit serotonin uptake by 50%. In contrast to the tricyclic antidepressants, paroxetine has little effect on the uptake of dopamine or noradrenaline (norepinephrine) in vitro. It has negligible affinity for alphar(1-), alphar(2-) and betar-adrenoceptors, dopamine D(1) and D(2) receptors, hi starnine H(1) receptors and serotonin 5-HT(1A), 5-HT(2A) and 5-HT(2C) receptors. However, paroxetine does have weak affinity for muscarinic cholinergic receptors.                 As shown in rats, paroxetine appears to indirectly activate somatodendritic 5-HT(1A) autoreceptors when initially administered, thereby inhibiting firing of 5-HT neurons and release of serotonin. This may explain why the onset of therapeutic effect of paroxetine is delayed. However, repeated administration of paroxetine causes adaptive changes in synaptic serotonergic receptors, including a decrease in the responsiveness of somatodendritic and terminal serotonin autoreceptors. Central betar-adrenoceptors are not down-regulated by administration of paroxetine to rats.                 Various studies in healthy volunteers without sleep disorders or volunteers reporting poor sleep have indicated that paroxetine disturbs normal sleep patterns by reducing rapid eye movement (REM) sleep time and lengthening REM latency. The effect of paroxetine on sleep in patients with panic disorder has not been determined, but in patients with depression the drug improves subjective quality of sleep. In electroencephalographic studies in healthy volunteers, administration of a single dose of paroxetine 30mg produced changes indicative of a sedative profile, whereas administration of 70mg produced changes indicative of activating properties.                 No significant impairment of psychomotor function was observed after administration of single or multiple doses of paroxetine 20 or 30mg to healthy volunteers or patients with depression. The sedation and impairment of psychomotor function caused by haloperidol, amobarbital, oxazepam or alcohol (ethanol) were not potentiated by the administration of paroxetine 30mg.                 In contrast to amitriptyline 150 mg/day or doxepin 150 mg/day, 2 to 6 weeks' treatment with paroxetine 20 or 30 mg/day did not produce clinically significant haemodynamic or electrophysiological effects on cardiac function in healthy volunteers or patients with depression. Fewer adverse cardiac effects were reported by paroxetine than nortriptyline recipients in a study in patients with depression and ischaemic heart disease.                 The anxiolytic activity of paroxetine has been demonstrated after 7 or 21 days' administration in several rodent models. PHARMACOKINETIC PROPERTIES: Paroxetine is well absorbed after oral administration. It undergoes extensive first-pass metabolism and is rapidly distributed into tissue. Only about 1% of the paroxetine dose remains in the systemic circulation. Approximately 95% of paroxetine is protein bound in the plasma. Steady-state concentrations are reached after 7 to 14 days of oral administration and the terminal elimination half-life (t1/2betar) is approximately 24 hours. However, there is a great deal of interindividual variation in the pharmacokinetics of paroxetine.                 Paroxetine is metabolised by at least 2 enzymes of the cytochrome P450 (CYP) system, one of which is CYP2D6. This enzyme is subject to genetic polymorphism, and thus the pharmacokinetics of paroxetine differ between individuals who have the enzyme (extensive metabolisers) and those who do not (poor metabolisers). The metabolites of paroxetine are essentially inactive.                 Metabolism of paroxetine by CYP2D6 is saturable. Consequently, with repeated administration, bioavailability of paroxetine increases and pharmacokinetics may become nonlinear in some patients, especially when the dosage of paroxetine is increased.                 Approximately two-thirds of a paroxetine dose is eliminated in the urine and the remainder is excreted in faeces. Almost all of the dose is eliminated as metabolites; lt3% is excreted as unchanged drug.                 The plasma concentration and area under the plasma concentration-time curve of paroxetine are greater, and the t1/2betar prolonged, in elderly patients and those with hepatic or severe renal impairment compared with the general population. Paroxetine distributes into breast milk to produce concentrations similar to those in plasma. THERAPEUTIC POTENTIAL: As shown in 3 short term placebo-controlled trials in patients with panic disorder with or without agoraphobia, oral paroxetine 10 to 60 mg/day is significantly more effective than placebo for most variables measuring reduction in panic attack frequency. The drug also produced significantly greater improvements in various anxiety and depression scales than placebo.                 An extension phase of one of the placebo-controlled studies showed that the efficacy of paroxetine in reducing panic attack frequency is maintained during up to 6 months' treatment and that the drug reduces the risk of relapse.                 Oral paroxetine 10 to 60 mg/day was at least as effective as clomipramine 10 to 150 mg/day in a comparative study. During weeks 7 to 9 of treatment, 51% of paroxetine recipients had no full panic attacks, compared with 37% of clomipramine recipients. The onset of action appeared to be more rapid for paroxetine than for clomipramine. The 2 drugs were equally effective in improving generalised anxiety, phobic avoidance and social, family and work interactions.                 In patients who elected to continue treatment for a further 36 weeks in an extension phase of the above study, response rates increased further in all groups, including the placebo group. During weeks 34 to 36 of extended treatment, 85% of paroxetine recipients, 72% of clomipramine recipients and 59% of placebo recipients had no panic attacks. The difference between paroxetine and placebo was statistically significant at this time point; however, there was no significant difference between groups at the primary efficacy endpoint (weeks 22 to 24). TOLERABILITY: Paroxetine is generally well tolerated by both younger and older individuals and its adverse event profile is consistent with that expected for an SSRI. The tolerability profile of paroxetine in patients with panic disorder appears to resemble that in patients with depression. Headache, nausea, somnolence, dry mouth and insomnia were the most common adverse events among 469 patients with panic disorder who received paroxetine 10 to 60 mg/day in short term clinical trials. The individual incidences for these events ranged from 18 to 25%; however, the incidence of headache in paroxetine-treated patients was the same as that in placebo recipients. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED)",
