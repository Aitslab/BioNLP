        "abstract": "Antacids: Absorption of a single dose of Myfortic was decreased when administered to 12 stable renal transplant patients also taking magnesium-aluminum containing antacids (30 mL): the mean Cmax and AUC(0-t) values for MPA were 25% and 37% lower, respectively, than when Myfortic was administered alone under fasting conditions. It is recommended that Myfortic and antacids not be administered simultaneously. Cyclosporine: When studied in stable renal transplant patients, cyclosporine, USP (MODIFIED) pharmacokinetics were unaffected by steady state dosing of Myfortic. Acyclovir/Ganciclovir: may be taken with Myfortic; however, during the period of treatment, physicians should monitor blood cell counts. Both acyclovir/ganciclovir and MPAG concentrations are increased in the presence of renal impairment, their coexistence may compete for tubular secretion and further increase in the concentrations of the two. Azathioprine/Mycophenolate Mofetil: Given that azathioprine and mycophenolate mofetil inhibit purine metabolism, it is recommended that Myfortic not be administered concomitantly with azathioprine or mycophenolate mofetil. Cholestyramine and Drugs that Bind Bile Acids: These drugs interrupt enterohepatic recirculation and reduce MPA exposure when coadministered with mycophenolate mofetil. Therefore, do not administer Myfortic with cholestyramine or other agents that may interfere with enterohepatic recirculation or drugs that may bind bile acids, for example bile acid sequestrates or oral activated charcoal, because of the potential to reduce the efficacy of Myfortic. Oral Contraceptives: Given the different metabolism of Myfortic and oral contraceptives, no drug interaction between these two classes of drug is expected. However, in a drug-drug interaction study, mean levonorgesterol AUC was decreased by 15% when coadministered with mycophenolate mofetil. Therefore, it is recommended that oral contraceptives are co- administered with Myfortic with caution and additional birth control methods be considered. Live Vaccines: During treatment with Myfortic, the use of live attenuated vaccines should be avoided and patients should be advised that vaccinations may be less effective. Influenza vaccination may be of value. Prescribers should refer to national guidelines for influenza vaccination. Drugs that alter the gastrointestinal flora may interact with Myfortic by disrupting enterohepatic recirculation. Interference of MPAG hydrolysis may lead to less MPA available for absorption.",

        "abstract": "Cholestyramine: Concomitant cholestyramine administration decreased the mean AUC of total ezetimibe approximately 55%. The incremental LDL-C reduction due to adding ezetimibe to cholestyramine may be reduced by this interaction. Fibrates: The safety and effectiveness of ezetimibe administered with fibrates have not been established. Fibrates may increase cholesterol excretion into the bile, leading to cholelithiasis. In a preclinical study in dogs, ezetimibe increased cholesterol in the gallbladder bile. Co-administration of ZETIA with fibrates is not recommended until use in patients is studied. Fenofibrate: In a pharmacokinetic study, concomitant fenofibrate administration increased total ezetimibe concentrations approximately 1.5-fold. Gemfibrozil: In a pharmacokinetic study, concomitant gemfibrozil administration increased total ezetimibe concentrations approximately 1.7-fold. HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors: No clinically significant pharmacokinetic interactions were seen when ezetimibe was co-administered with atorvastatin, simvastatin, pravastatin, lovastatin, or fluvastatin. Cyclosporine: The total ezetimibe level increased 12-fold in one renal transplant patient receiving multiple medications, including cyclosporine. Patients who take both ezetimibe and cyclosporine should be carefully monitored. Carcinogenesis, Mutagenesis, Impairment of Fertility A 104-week dietary carcinogenicity study with ezetimibe was conducted in rats at doses up to 1500 mg/kg/day (males) and 500 mg/kg/day (females) (~20 times the human exposure at 10 mg daily based on AUC0-24hr for total ezetimibe). A 104-week dietary carcinogenicity study with ezetimibe was also conducted in mice at doses up to 500 mg/kg/day (>150 times the human exposure at 10 mg daily based on AUC0-24hr for total ezetimibe). There were no statistically significant increases in tumor incidences in drug-treated rats or mice. No evidence of mutagenicity was observed in vitro in a microbial mutagenicity (Ames) test with Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli with or without metabolic activation. No evidence of clastogenicity was observed in vitro in a chromosomal aberration assay in human peripheral blood lymphocytes with or without metabolic activation. In addition, there was no evidence of genotoxicity in the in vivo mouse micronucleus test. In oral (gavage) fertility studies of ezetimibe conducted in rats, there was no evidence of reproductive toxicity at doses up to 1000 mg/kg/day in male or female rats (~7 times the human exposure at 10 mg daily based on AUC0-24hr for total ezetimibe). Pregnancy Pregnancy Category: C There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of ezetimibe in pregnant women. Ezetimibe should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the risk to the fetus. In oral (gavage) embryo-fetal development studies of ezetimibe conducted in rats and rabbits during organogenesis, there was no evidence of embryolethal effects at the doses tested (250, 500, 1000 mg/kg/day). In rats, increased incidences of common fetal skeletal findings (extra pair of thoracic ribs, unossified cervical vertebral centra, shortened ribs) were observed at 1000 mg/kg/day (~10 times the human exposure at 10 mg daily based on AUC0-24hr for total ezetimibe). In rabbits treated with ezetimibe, an increased incidence of extra thoracic ribs was observed at 1000 mg/kg/day (150 times the human exposure at 10 mg daily based on AUC0-24hr for total ezetimibe). Ezetimibe crossed the placenta when pregnant rats and rabbits were given multiple oral doses. Multiple dose studies of ezetimibe given in combination with HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors (statins) in rats and rabbits during organogenesis result in higher ezetimibe and statin exposures. Reproductive findings occur at lower doses in combination therapy compared to monotherapy. All HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors are contraindicated in pregnant and nursing women. When ZETIA is administered with an HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor in a woman of childbearing potential, refer to the pregnancy category and package labeling for the HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor. Labor and Delivery The effects of ZETIA on labor and delivery in pregnant women are unknown. Nursing Mothers In rat studies, exposure to total ezetimibe in nursing pups was up to half of that observed in maternal plasma. It is not known whether ezetimibe is excreted into human breast milk; therefore, ZETIA should not be used in nursing mothers unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to the infant. Pediatric Use The pharmacokinetics of ZETIA in adolescents (10 to 18 years) have been shown to be similar to that in adults. Treatment experience with ZETIA in the pediatric population is limited to 4 patients (9 to 17 years) in the sitosterolemia study and 5 patients (11 to 17 years) in the HoFH study. Treatment with ZETIA in children (<10 years) is not recommended. Geriatric Use Of the patients who received ZETIA in clinical studies, 948 were 65 and older (this included 206 who were 75 and older). The effectiveness and safety of ZETIA were similar between these patients and younger subjects. Greater sensitivity of some older individuals cannot be ruled out.",

        "abstract": "Ketoconazole: Spontaneous adverse reaction reports of patients taking concomitant ketoconazole with recommended doses of terfenadine demonstrate QT interval prolongation and rare serious cardiac events, e.g. death, cardiac arrest, and ventricular arrhythmia including torsades de pointes. Pharmacokinetic data indicate that ketoconazole markedly inhibits the metabolism of terfenadine, resulting in elevated plasma terfenadine levels. Presence of unchanged terfenadine is associated with statistically significant prolongation of the QT and QTc intervals. Concomitant administration of ketoconazole and terfenadine is contraindicated. Itraconazole: Torsades de pointes and elevated parent terfenadine levels have been reported during concomitant use of terfenadine and itraconazole in clinical trials of itraconazole and from foreign post-marketing sources. One death has also been reported from foreign post- marketing sources. Concomitant administration of itraconazole and terfenadine is contraindicated. Due to the chemical similarity of other azole-type antifungal agents (including fluconazole, metronidazole, and miconazole) to ketoconazole, and itraconazole, concomitant use of these products with terfenadine is not recommended pending full examination of potential interactions. Macrolides: Clinical drug interaction studies indicate that erythromycin and clarithromycin can exert an effect on terfenadine metabolism by a mechanism which may be similar to that of ketoconazole, but to a lesser extent. Although erythromycin measurably decreases the clearance of the terfenadine acid metabolite, its influence on terfenadine plasma levels is still under investigation. A few spontaneous accounts of QT interval prolongation with ventricular arrhythmia including torsades de pointes, have been reported in patients receiving erythromycin or troleandomycin. Concomitant administration of terfenadine with clarithromycin, erythromycin, or troleandomycin is contraindicated: Pending full characterization of potential interactions, concomitant administration of terfenadine with other macrolide antibiotics, including azithromycin, is not recommended. Studies to evaluate potential interactions of terfenadine with azithromycin are in progress.",

Additive sedative effects can occur when metoclopramide is given with alcohol, sedatives, hypnotics, narcotics, or tranquilizers. The finding that metoclopramide releases catecholamines in patients with essential hypertension suggests that it should be used cautiously, if at all, in patients receiving monoamine oxi-dase inhibitors. Absorption of drugs from the stomach may be diminished (e.g., digoxin) by metoclopramide, whereas the rate and/or extent of absorption of drugs from the small bowel may be increased (e.g., acetaminophen, tetracycline, levodopa, ethanol, cyclosporine). Gastroparesis (gastric stasis) may be responsible for poor diabetic control in some patients. Exogenously administered insulin may begin to act before food has left the stomach and lead to hypoglycemia. Because the action of metoclopramide will influence the delivery of food to the intestines and thus the rate of absorption, insulin dosage or timing of dosage may require adjustment.",

        "abstract": "ACE inhibitors Reports suggest that NSAIDs may diminish the antihypertensive effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. This interaction should be given consideration in patients taking NSAIDs concomitantly with ACE inhibitors. Aspirin: Concomitant administration of aspirin (1000 mg TID) to healthy volunteers tended to increase the AUC (10%) and Cmax (24%) of meloxicam. The clinical significance of this interaction is not known; however, as with other NSAIDs, concomitant administration of meloxicam and aspirin is not generally recommended because of the potential for increased adverse effects. Concomitant administration of low-dose aspirin with MOBIC may result in an increased rate of GI ulceration or other complications, compared to use of MOBIC alone. MOBIC is not a substitute for aspirin for cardiovascular prophylaxis. Cholestyramine: Pretreatment for four days with cholestyramine significantly increased the clearance of meloxicam by 50%. This resulted in a decrease in t1/2, from 19.2 hours to 12.5 hours, and a 35% reduction in AUC. This suggests the existence of a recirculation pathway for meloxicam in the gastrointestinal tract. The clinical relevance of this interaction has not been established. Cimetidine: Concomitant administration of 200 mg cimetidine QID did not alter the single-dose pharmacokinetics of 30 mg meloxicam. Digoxin: Meloxicam 15 mg once daily for 7 days did not alter the plasma concentration profile of digoxin after b-acetyldigoxin administration for 7 days at clinical doses. In vitro testing found no protein binding drug interaction between digoxin and meloxicam. Furosemide: Clinical studies, as well as post-marketing observations, have shown that NSAIDs can reduce the natriuretic effect of furosemide and thiazide diuretics in some patients. This effect has been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis. Studies with furosemide agents and meloxicam have not demonstrated a reduction in natriuretic effect. Furosemide: single and multiple dose pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics are not affected by multiple doses of meloxicam. Nevertheless, during concomitant therapy with furosemide and MOBIC, patients should be observed closely for signs of declining renal function, as well as to assure diuretic efficacy. Lithium: In clinical trials, NSAIDs have produced an elevation of plasma lithium levels and a reduction in renal lithium clearance. In a study conducted in healthy subjects, mean pre-dose lithium concentration and AUC were increased by 21% in subjects receiving lithium doses ranging from 804 to 1072 mg BID with meloxicam 15 mg QD as compared to subjects receiving lithium alone. These effects have been attributed to inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis by MOBIC. Patients on lithium treatment should be closely monitored when MOBIC is introduced or withdrawn. Methotrexate: A study in 13 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients evaluated the effects of multiple doses of meloxicam on the pharmacokinetics of methotrexate taken once weekly. Meloxicam did not have a significant effect on the pharmacokinetics of single doses of methotrexate. In vitro, methotrexate did not displace meloxicam from its human serum binding sites. Warfarin: Anticoagulant activity should be monitored, particularly in the first few days after initiating or changing MOBIC therapy in patients receiving warfarin or similar agents, since these patients are at an increased risk of bleeding. The effect of meloxicam on the anticoagulant effect of warfarin was studied in a group of healthy subjects receiving daily doses of warfarin that produced an INR (International Normalized Ratio) between 1.2 and 1.8. In these subjects, meloxicam did not alter warfarin pharmacokinetics and the average anticoagulant effect of warfarin as determined by prothrombin time. However, one subject showed an increase in INR from 1.5 to 2.1. Caution should be used when administering MOBIC with warfarin since patients on warfarin may experience changes in INR and an increased risk of bleeding complications when a new medication is introduced.",

The possibility of hypotensive effects with UNIVASC    can be minimized by discontinuing diuretic therapy for several days or cautiously increasing salt intake before initiation of treatment with UNIVASC   . If this is not possible, the starting dose of moexpril should be reduced.. Potassium Supplements and Potassium-Sparing Diuretics: UNIVASC    can increase serum potassium because it decreases aldosterone secretion. Use of potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone, triamterene, amiloride) or potassium supplements concomitantly with ACE inhibitors can increase the risk of hyperkalemia. Therefore, if concomitant use of such agents is indicated, they should be given with caution and the patient's serum potassium should be monitored. Oral Anticoagulants: Interaction studies with warfarin failed to identify any clinically important effect on the serum concentrations of the anticoagulant or on its anticoagulant effect. Lithium: Increased serum lithium levels and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving ACE inhibitors during therapy with lithium. These drugs should be coadministered with caution, and frequent monitoring of serum lithium levels is recommended. If a diuretic is also used, the risk of lithium toxicity may be increased.

Drugs that induce hepatic enzymes such as phenobarbital, phenytoin and rifampin may increase the clearance of corticosteroids and may require increases in corticosteroid dose to achieve the desired response. Drugs such as troleandomycin and ketoconazole may inhibit the metabolism of corticosteroids and thus decrease their clearance. Therefore, the dose of corticosteroid should be titrated to avoid steroid toxicity. Corticosteroids may increase the clearance of chronic high dose aspirin. This could lead to decreased salicylate serum levels or increase the risk of salicylate toxicity when corticosteroid is withdrawn. Aspirin should be used cautiously in conjunction with corticosteroids in patients suffering from hypoprothrombinemia. The effect of corticosteroids on oral anticoagulants is variable. There are reports of enhanced as well as diminished effects of anticoagulants when given concurrently with corticosteroids. Therefore, coagulation indices should be monitored to maintain the desired anticoagulant effect.",

In vitro studies have also shown that terbinafine inhibits CYP2D6-mediated metabolism. This may be of clinical relevance for compounds predominantly metabolized by this enzyme, such as tricyclic antidepressants,    -blockers, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAO-Is) Type B, if they have a narrow therapeutic window. In vivo drug-drug interaction studies conducted in normal volunteer subjects showed that terbinafine does not affect the clearance of antipyrine or digoxin. Terbinafine decreases the clearance of caffeine by 19%. Terbinafine increases the clearance of cyclosporine by 15%. There have been spontaneous reports of increase or decrease in prothrombin times in patients concomitantly taking oral terbinafine and warfarin, however, a causal relationship between LAMISIL    Tablets and these changes has not been established. Terbinafine clearance is increased 100% by rifampin, a CyP450 enzyme inducer, and decreased 33% by cimetidine, a CyP450 enzyme inhibitor. Terbinafine clearance is unaffected by cyclosporine. There is no information available from adequate drug-drug interaction studies with the following classes of drugs: oral contraceptives, hormone replacement therapies, hypoglycemics, theophyllines, phenytoins, thiazide diuretics, beta blockers, and calcium channel blockers.",

Selegiline: In healthy volunteers (N= 11), selegiline did not influence the pharmacokinetics of pramipexole. Amantadine: Population pharmacokinetic analysis suggests that amantadine is unlikely to alter the oral clearance of pramipexole (N= 54). Cimetidine: Cimetidine, a known inhibitor of renal tubular secretion of organic bases via the cationic transport system, caused a 50% increase in pramipexole AUC and a 40% increase in half-life (N= 12). Probenecid: Probenecid, a known inhibitor of renal tubular secretion of organic acids via the aruonic transporter, did not noticeably influence pramipexole pharmacokinetics (N= 12). Other drugs eliminated via renal secretion: Population pharmacokinetic analysis suggests that coadministration of drugs that are secreted by the cationic transport system (e.g., cimetidine, ranitidine, diltiazem, triamterene, verapamil, quinidine, and quinine) decreases the oral clearance of pramipexole by about 20%, while those secreted by the anionic transport system (e.g., cephalosporins, penicillins, indomethacin, hydrochlorothiazide, and chlorpropamide) are likely to have little effect on the oral clearance of pramipexole. CYP interactions: Inhibitors of cytochrome P450 enzymes would not be expected to affect pramipexole elimination because pramipexole is not appreciably metabolized by these enzymes in vivo or in vitro. Pramipexole does not inhibit CYP enzymes CYPIA2, CYP2C9, CYP2CI9, CYP2EI, and CYP3A4. Inhibition of CYP2D6 was observed with an apparent Ki of 30 uM, indicating that pramipexole will not inhibit CYP enzymes at plasma concentrations observed following the highest recommended clinical dose (1.5 mg tid). Dopamine antagonists: Since pramipexole is a dopamine agonist, it is possible that dopamine antagonists, such as the neuroleptics (phenothiazines, butyrophenones, thioxanthenes) or metoclopramide, may diminish the effectiveness of MIRAPEX.

Patients should be followed carefully to detect side reactions or unusual manifestations of drug idiosyncrasy. Patients may require reduced doses of anesthetics when on methyldopa. If hypotension does occur during anesthesia, it usually can be controlled by vasopressors. The adrenergic receptors remain sensitive during treatment with methyldopa. When methyldopa and lithium are given concomitantly the patient should be carefully monitored for symptoms of lithium toxicity. Read the circular for lithium preparations. Several studies demonstrate a decrease in the bioavailability of methyldopa when it is ingested with ferrous sulfate or ferrous gluconate. This may adversely affect blood pressure control in patients treated with methyldopa. Coadministration of methyldopa with ferrous sulfate or ferrous gluconate is not recommended. Monoamine oxidase (MAO) inhibitors: See CONTRAINDICATIONS. Drug/Laboratory Test Interactions Methyldopa may interfere with measurement of: urinary uric acid by the phosphotungstate method, serum creatinine by the alkaline picrate method, and SGOT by colorimetric methods. Interference with spectrophotometric methods for SGOT analysis has not been reported. Since methyldopa causes fluorescence in urine samples at the same wave lengths as catecholamines, falsely high levels of urinary catecholamines may be reported. This will interfere with the diagnosis of pheochromocytoma. It is important to recognize this phenomenon before a patient with a possible pheochromocytoma is subjected to surgery. Methyldopa does not interfere with measurement of VMA (vanillylmandelic acid), a test for pheochromocytoma, by those methods which convert VMA to vanillin. Methyldopa is not recommended for the treatment of patients with pheochromocytoma. Rarely, when urine is exposed to air after voiding, it may darken because of breakdown of methyldopa or its metabolites.",

        "abstract": "Although MIVACRON (a mixture of three stereoisomers) has been administered safely following succinylcholine-facilitated tracheal intubation, the interaction between MIVACRON and succinylcholine has not been systematically studied. Prior administration of succinylcholine can potentiate the neuromuscular blocking effects of nondepolarizing agents. Evidence of spontaneous recovery from succinylcholine should be observed before the administration of MIVACRON. The use of MIVACRON before succinylcholine to attenuate some of the side effects of succinylcholine has not been studied. There are no clinical data on the use of MIVACRON with other nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents. Isoflurane and enflurane (administered with nitrous oxide/oxygen to achieve 1.25 M.C. decrease the ED50 of MIVACRON by as much as 25% (see CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Pharmacodynamics and Individualization of Dosages). These agents may also prolong the clinically effective duration of action and decrease the average infusion requirement of MIVACRON by as much as 35% to 40%. A greater potentiation of the neuromuscular blocking effects of MIVACRON may be expected with higher concentrations of enflurane or isoflurane. Halothane has little or no effect on the ED50 , but may prolong the duration of action and decrease the average infusion requirement by as much as 20%. Other drugs which may enhance the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing agents such as MIVACRON include certain antibiotics (e.g., aminoglycosides, tetracyclines, bacitracin, polymyxins, lincomycin, clindamycin, colistin, and sodium colistimethate), magnesium salts, lithium, local anesthetics, procainamide, and quinidine. The neuromuscular blocking effect of MIVACRON may be enhanced by drugs that reduce plasma cholinesterase activity (e.g., chronically administered oral contraceptives, glucocorticoids, or certain monoamine oxidase inhibitors) or by drugs that irreversibly inhibit plasma cholinesterase . Resistance to the neuromuscular blocking action of nondepolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents has been demonstrated in patients chronically administered phenytoin or carbamazepine. While the effects of chronic phenytoin or carbamazepine therapy on the action of MIVACRON are unknown, slightly shorter durations of neuromuscular block may be anticipated and infusion rate requirements may be higher. Some drug interactions are:  - birth control pills - corticosteroids - medicines for angina or high blood pressure - medicines for pain - medicines to control seizures such as phenytoin or carbamazepine - certain antibiotics given by injection - cisplatin - edrophonium - neostigmine - polymyxin B or bacitracin - local anesthetics such as procaine - general anesthetics - succinylcholine or other muscle relaxants",

        "abstract": "Diuretics: Patients on diuretics, and especially those started recently, may occasionally experience an excessive reduction of blood pressure after initiation of ACEON    Tablets therapy. The possibility of hypotensive effects can be minimized by either discontinuing the diuretic or increasing the salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with perindopril. If diuretics cannot be interrupted, close medical supervision should be provided with the first dose of ACEON    Tablets, for at least two hours and until blood pressure has stabilized for another hour. The rate and extent of perindopril absorption and elimination are not affected by concomitant diuretics. The bioavailability of perindoprilat was reduced by diuretics, however, and this was associated with a decrease in plasma ACE inhibition. Potassium Supplements and Potassium-Sparing Diuretics: ACEON    Tablets may increase serum potassium because of its potential to decrease aldosterone production. Use of potassium-sparing diuretics (spironolactone, amiloride, triamterene and others), potassium supplements or other drugs capable of increasing serum potassium (indomethacin, heparin, cyclosporine and others) can increase the risk of hyperkalemia. Therefore, if concomitant use of such agents is indicated, they should be given with caution and the patient's serum potassium should be monitored frequently. Lithium: Increased serum lithium and symptoms of lithium toxicity have been reported in patients receiving concomitant lithium and ACE inhibitor therapy. These drugs should be coadministered with caution and frequent monitoring of serum lithium concentration is recommended. Use of a diuretic may further increase the risk of lithium toxicity. Digoxin: A controlled pharmacokinetic study has shown no effect on plasma digoxin concentrations when coadministered with ACEON    Tablets, but an effect of digoxin on the plasma concentration of perindopril/perindoprilat has not been excluded. Gentamicin: Animal data have suggested the possibility of interaction between perindopril and gentamicin. However, this has not been investigated in human studies. Coadministration of both drugs should proceed with caution. Food Interaction: Oral administration of ACEON    Tablets with food does not significantly lower the rate or extent of perindopril absorption relative to the fasted state. However, the extent of biotransformation of perindopril to the active metabolite, perindoprilat, is reduced approximately 43%, resulting in a reduction in the plasma ACE inhibition curve of approximately 20%, probably clinically insignificant. In clinical trials, perindopril was generally administered in a non-fasting state.",

In these studies, no interaction that altered the pharmacokinetics of micafungin was observed.

Nifedipine AUC and Cmax were increased by 18% and 42%, respectively, in the presence of steady-state MYCAMINE compared with nifedipine alone.

        "abstract": "Potential for INVEGA    to Affect Other Drugs Paliperidone is not expected to cause clinically important pharmacokinetic interactions with drugs that are metabolized by cytochrome P450 isozymes. In vitro studies in human liver microsomes showed that paliperidone does not substantially inhibit the metabolism of drugs metabolized by cytochrome P450 isozymes, including CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C8/9/10, CYP2D6, CYP2E1, CYP3A4, and CYP3A5. Therefore, paliperidone is not expected to inhibit clearance of drugs that are metabolized by these metabolic pathways in a clinically relevant manner. Paliperidone is also not expected to have enzyme inducing properties. At therapeutic concentrations, paliperidone did not inhibit P-glycoprotein. Paliperidone is therefore not expected to inhibit P-glycoprotein-mediated transport of other drugs in a clinically relevant manner. Given the primary CNS effects of paliperidone, INVEGA    should be used with caution in combination with other centrally acting drugs and alcohol. Paliperidone may antagonize the effect of levodopa and other dopamine agonists. Because of its potential for inducing orthostatic hypotension, an additive effect may be observed when INVEGA    is administered with other therapeutic agents that have this potential. Potential for Other Drugs to Affect INVEGA    Paliperidone is not a substrate of CYP1A2, CYP2A6, CYP2C9, and CYP2C19, so that an interaction with inhibitors or inducers of these isozymes is unlikely. While in vitro studies indicate that CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 may be minimally involved in paliperidone metabolism, in vivo studies do not show decreased elimination by these isozymes and they contribute to only a small fraction of total body clearance.",

        "abstract": "Ondansetron does not itself appear to induce or inhibit the cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzyme system of the liver. Because ondansetron is metabolized by hepatic cytochrome P-450 drug-metabolizing enzymes (CYP3A4, CYP2D6, CYP1A2), inducers or inhibitors of these enzymes may change the clearance and, hence, the half-life of ondansetron. On the basis of limited available data, no dosage adjustment is recommended for patients on these drugs. Phenytoin, Carbamazepine, and Rifampicin: In patients treated with potent inducers of CYP3A4 (i.e., phenytoin, carbamazepine, and rifampicin), the clearance of ondansetron was significantly increased and ondansetron blood concentrations were decreased. However, on the basis of available data, no dosage adjustment for ondansetron is recommended for patients on these drugs.1,3  Tramadol: Although no pharmacokinetic drug interaction between ondansetron and tramadol has been observed, data from 2 small studies indicate that ondansetron may be associated with an increase in patient controlled administration of tramadol.4,5  Chemotherapy: Tumor response to chemotherapy in the P 388 mouse leukemia model is not affected by ondansetron. In humans, carmustine, etoposide, and cisplatin do not affect the pharmacokinetics of ondansetron. In a crossover study in 76 pediatric patients, I.V. ondansetron did not increase blood levels of high-dose methotrexate.",

        "abstract": "Clinically or potentially significant drug interactions between DIFLUCAN and the following agents/classes have been observed. These are described in greater detail below: DIFLUCAN and the following agents/classes have been observed. These are described in greater detail below:  Oral hypoglycemics, Coumarin-type anticoagulants, Phenytoin, Cyclosporine, Rifampin, Theophylline, Terfenadine, Cisapride, Astemizole, Rifabutin, Tacrolimus, Short-acting benzodiazepines,  Oral hypoglycemics: Clinically significant hypoglycemia may be precipitated by the use of DIFLUCAN with oral hypoglycemic agents; one fatality has been reported from hypoglycemia in association with combined DIFLUCAN and glyburide use. DIFLUCAN reduces the metabolism of tolbutamide, glyburide, and glipizide and increases the plasma concentration of these agents. When DIFLUCAN is used concomitantly with these or other sulfonylurea oral hypoglycemic agents, blood glucose concentrations should be carefully monitored and the dose of the sulfonylurea should be adjusted as necessary. Coumarin-type anticoagulants: Prothrombin time may be increased in patients receiving concomitant DIFLUCAN and coumarin-type anticoagulants. In post-marketing experience, as with other azole antifungals, bleeding events (bruising, epistaxis, gastrointestinal bleeding, hematuria, and melena) have been reported in association with increases in prothrombin time in patients receiving fluconazole concurrently with warfarin. Careful monitoring of prothrombin time in patients receiving DIFLUCAN and coumarin-type anticoagulants is recommended. (See <a href= \"flucon_cp.htm#CP\">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Drug Interaction Studies.) Phenytoin: DIFLUCAN increases the plasma concentrations of phenytoin. Careful monitoring of phenytoin concentrations in patients receiving DIFLUCAN and phenytoin is recommended. (See <a href= \"flucon_cp.htm#CP\">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Drug Interaction Studies.) Cyclosporine: DIFLUCAN may significantly increase cyclosporine levels in renal transplant patients with or without renal impairment. Careful monitoring of cyclosporine concentrations and serum creatinine is recommended in patients receiving DIFLUCAN and cyclosporine. (See CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY: Drug Interaction Studies.) Rifampin: Rifampin enhances the metabolism of concurrently administered DIFLUCAN. Depending on clinical circumstances, consideration should be given to increasing the dose of DIFLUCAN when it is administered with rifampin. Theophylline: DIFLUCAN increases the serum concentrations of theophylline. Careful monitoring of serum theophylline concentrations in patients receiving DIFLUCAN and theophylline is recommended. Terfenadine: Because of the occurrence of serious cardiac dysrhythmias secondary to prolongation of the QTc interval in patients receiving azole antifungals in conjunction with terfenadine, interaction studies have been performed. One study at a 200-mg daily dose of fluconazole failed to demonstrate a prolongation in QTc interval. Another study at a 400-mg and 800-mg daily dose of fluconazole demonstrated that DIFLUCAN taken in doses of 400 mg per day or greater significantly increases plasma levels of terfenadine when taken concomitantly. The combined use of fluconazole at doses of 400 mg or greater with terfenadine is contraindicated. The coadministration of fluconazole at doses lower than 400 mg/day with terfenadine should be carefully monitored. Cisapride: There have been reports of cardiac events, including torsade de pointes in patients to whom fluconazole and cisapride were coadministered. A controlled study found that concomitant fluconazole 200 mg once daily and cisapride 20 mg four times a day yielded a significant increase in cisapride plasma levels and prolongation of QTc interval. The combined use of fluconazole with cisapride is contraindicated. Astemizole: The use of fluconazole in patients concurrently taking astemizole or other drugs metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system may be associated with elevations in serum levels of these drugs. In the absence of definitive information, caution should be used when coadministering fluconazole. Patients should be carefully monitored. Rifabutin: There have been reports of uveitis in patients to whom fluconazole and rifabutin were coadministered. Patients receiving rifabutin and fluconazole concomitantly should be carefully monitored. Tacrolimus: There have been reports of nephrotoxicity in patients to whom fluconazole and tacrolimus were coadministered. Patients receiving tacrolimus and fluconazole concomitantly should be carefully monitored. Short-acting Benzodiazepines: Following oral administration of midazolam, fluconazole resulted in substantial increases in midazolam concentrations and psychomotor effects. This effect on midazolam appears to be more pronounced following oral administration of fluconazole than with fluconazole administered intravenously. If short-acting benzodiazepines, which are metabolized by the cytochrome P450 system, are concomitantly administered with fluconazole, consideration should be given to decreasing the benzodiazepine dosage, and the patients should be appropriately monitored. Fluconazole tablets coadministered with ethinyl estradiol- and levonorgestrel-containing oral contraceptives produced an overall mean increase in ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel levels; however, in some patients there were decreases up to 47% and 33% of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel levels. The data presently available indicate that the decreases in some individual ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel AUC values with fluconazole treatment are likely the result of random variation. While there is evidence that fluconazole can inhibit the metabolism of ethinyl estradiol and levonorgestrel, there is no evidence that fluconazole is a net inducer of ethinyl estradiol or levonorgestrel metabolism. The clinical significance of these effects is presently unknown. Physicians should be aware that interaction studies with medications other than those listed in the <a href= \"flucon_cp.htm#CP\">CLINICAL PHARMACOLOGY section have not been conducted, but such interactions may occur.",

In vivo, the plasma clearance of ropivacaine was reduced by 70% during coadministration of fluvoxamine (25 mg bid for 2 days), a selective and potent CYP1A2 inhibitor. Thus strong inhibitors of cytochrome P4501A2, such as fluvoxamine, given concomitantly during administration of Ropivacaine, can interact with Ropivacaine leading to increased ropivacaine plasma levels. Caution should be exercised when CYP1A2 inhibitors are coadministered. Possible interactions with drugs known to be metabolized by CYP1A2 via competitive inhibition such as theophylline and imipramine may also occur. Coadministration of a selective and potent inhibitor of CYP3A4, ketoconazole (100 mg bid for 2 days with ropivacaine infusion administered 1 hour after ketoconazole) caused a 15% reduction in in-vivo plasma clearance of ropivacaine.",

Plasma levels of piroxicam are depressed to approximately 80% of their normal values when FELDENE is administered in conjunction with aspirin (3900 mg/day), but concomitant administration of antacids has no effect on piroxicam plasma levels . Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, including FELDENE, have been reported to increase steady state plasma lithium levels. It is recommended that plasma lithium levels be monitored when initiating, adjusting and discontinuing FELDENE.",

Mutual inhibition of metabolism occurs with concurrent use of cyclosporin and methylprednisolone; therefore, it is possible that adverse events associated with the individual use of either drug may be more apt to occur. convulsions have been reported with concurrent use of methylprednisolone and cyclosporin. Drugs that induce hepatic enzymes such as phenobarbital, phenytoin, and rifampin may increase the clearance of methylprednisolone and may require increased in methylprednisolone dose to achieve the desired response. Drugs such as troleandomycin and ketoconazole may inhibit the metabolism of methylprednisolone and thus decrease its clearance. Therefore, the dose of methylprednisolone should be titrated to avoid steroid toxicity. Methylprednisolone may increase the clearance of chronic high dose aspirin. This could lead to decreased salicylate serum levels or increase the risk of salicylate toxicity when methylprednisolone is withdrawn. Aspirin should be used cautiously in conjunction with corticosteroids in patients suffering from hypoprothrombinemia. The effect of methylprednisolone on oral anticoagulants is variable. There are reports of enhanced as well as diminished effects of anticoagulant when given concurrently with corticosteroids. Therefore, coagulation indices should be monitored to maintain the desired anticoagulant effect.",

Furthermore, rifampin, dexamethasone, St. John   s Wort, and certain anticonvulsants (phenytoin, phenobarbital, carbamazepine) may induce mifepristone metabolism (lowering serum levels of mifepristone). Based on in vitro inhibition information, coadministration of mifepristone may lead to an increase in serum levels of drugs that are CYP 3A4 substrates. Due to the slow elimination of mifepristone from the body, such interaction may be observed for a prolonged period after its administration.

        "abstract": "Since MEXITIL is a substrate for the metabolic pathways involving CYP2D6 and CYP1A2 enzymes, inhibition or induction of either of these enzymes would be expected to alter mexiletine plasma concentrations. In a formal, single-dose interaction study (n = 6 males) the clearance of mexiletine was decreased by 38% following the coadministration of fluvoxamine, an inhibitor of CYP1A2. In another formal study (n = 8 extensive and n = 7 poor metabolizers of CYP2D6), coadministration of propafenone did not alter the kinetics of mexiletine in the poor CYP2D6 metabolizer group. However, the metabolic clearance of mexiletine in the extensive metabolizer phenotype decreased by about 70% making the poor and extensive metabolizer groups indistinguishable. In this crossover steady state study, the pharmacokinetics of propafenone were unaffected in either phenotype by the coadministration of mexiletine. Addition of mexiletine to propafenone did not lead to further electrocardiographic parameters changes of QRS, QTc, RR, and PR intervals than propafenone alone. When concomitant administration of either of these two drugs with mexiletine is initiated, the dose of mexiletine should be slowly titrated to desired effect. In a large compassionate use program Mexitil    has been used concurrently with commonly employed antianginal, antihypertensive, and anticoagulant drugs without observed interactions. A variety of antiarrhythmics such as quinidine or propranolol were also added, sometimes with improved control of ventricular ectopy. When phenytoin or other hepatic enzyme inducers such as rifampin and phenobarbital have been taken concurrently with Mexitil   , lowered Mexitil    plasma levels have been reported. Monitoring of Mexitil    plasma levels is recommended during such concurrent use to avoid ineffective therapy. In a formal study, benzodiazepines were shown not to affect Mexitil    plasma concentrations. ECG intervals (PR, QRS, and QT) were not affected by concurrent Mexitil    and digoxin, diuretics, or propranolol. Concurrent administration of cimetidine and Mexitil    has been reported to increase, decrease, or leave unchanged Mexitil    plasma levels; therefore patients should be followed carefully during concurrent therapy. Mexitil    does not alter serum digoxin levels but magnesium-aluminum hydroxide, when used to treat gastrointestinal symptoms due to Mexitil   , has been reported to lower serum digoxin levels. Concurrent use of Mexitil    and theophylline may lead to increased plasma theophylline levels. One controlled study in eight normal subjects showed a 72% mean increase (range 35-136%) in plasma theophylline levels. This increase was observed at the first test point which was the second day after starting Mexitil   . Theophylline plasma levels returned to pre-Mexitil    values within 48 hours after discontinuing Mexitil   . If Mexitil and theophylline are to be used concurrently, theophylline blood levels should be monitored, particularly when the Mexitil    dose is changed. An appropriate adjustment in theophylline dose should be considered. Additionally, in one controlled study in five normal subjects and seven patients, the clearance of caffeine was decreased 50% following the administration of Mexitil   .",

        "abstract": "Drug Interactions: Inhibitors of CYP3A4 Isozymes: Caution is advised when midazolam is administered concomitantly with drugs that are known to inhibit the cytochrome P450 3A4 enzyme system (ie, some drugs in the drug classes of azole antimycotics, protease inhibitors, calcium channel antagonists, and macrolide antibiotics). Drugs such as erythromycin, diltiazem, verapamil, ketoconazole, fluconazole and itraconazole were shown to significantly increase the C max and AUC of orally administered midazolam. These drug interactions may result in increased and prolonged sedation due to a decrease in plasma clearance of midazolam. Although not studied, the potent cytochrome P450 3A4 inhibitors ritonavir and nelfinavir may cause intense and prolonged sedation and respiratory depression due to a decrease in plasma clearance of midazolam. Caution is advised when VERSED Syrup is used concomitantly with these drugs. Dose adjustments should be considered and possible prolongation and intensity of effect should be anticipated. Inducers of CYP3A4 Isozymes: Cytochrome P450 inducers, such as rifampin, carbamazepine, and phenytoin, induce metabolism and caused a markedly decreased C max and AUC of oral midazolam in adult studies. Although clinical studies have not been performed, phenobarbital is expected to have the same effect. Caution is advised when administering VERSED Syrup to patients receiving these medications and if necessary dose adjustments should be considered. The difficulty in achieving adequate sedation may have been the result of decreased absorption of the sedatives due to both the gastrointestinal effects and stimulant effects of methylphenidate. The sedative effect of VERSED Syrup is accentuated by any concomitantly administered medication which depresses the central nervous system, particularly narcotics (eg, morphine, meperidine and fentanyl), propofol, ketamine, nitrous oxide, secobarbital and droperidol. Consequently, the dose of VERSED Syrup should be adjusted according to the type and amount of concomitant medications administered and the desired clinical response. No significant adverse interactions with common premedications (such as atropine, scopolamine, glycopyrrolate, diazepam, hydroxyzine, and other muscle relaxants) or local anesthetics have been observed.",

        "abstract": "Drug-Drug Interactions Effect of Exelon    (rivastigmine tartrate) on the Metabolism of Other Drugs: Rivastigmine is primarily metabolized through hydrolysis by esterases. Minimal metabolism occurs via the major cytochrome P450 isoenzymes. Based on in vitro studies, no pharmacokinetic drug interactions with drugs metabolized by the following isoenzyme systems are expected: CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP3A4/5, CYP2E1, CYP2C9, CYP2C8, or CYP2C19. No pharmacokinetic interaction was observed between rivastigmine and digoxin, warfarin, diazepam, or fluoxetine in studies in healthy volunteers. The elevation of prothrombin time induced by warfarin is not affected by administration of Exelon. Effect of Other Drugs on the Metabolism of Exelon: Drugs that induce or inhibit CYP450 metabolism are not expected to alter the metabolism of rivastigmine. Single dose pharmacokinetic studies demonstrated that the metabolism of rivastigmine is not significantly affected by concurrent administration of digoxin, warfarin, diazepam, or fluoxetine. Population PK analysis with a database of 625 patients showed that the pharmacokinetics of rivastigmine were not influenced by commonly prescribed medications such as antacids (n=77), antihypertensives (n=72), calcium channel blockers (n=75), antidiabetics (n=21), nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (n=79), estrogens (n=70), salicylate analgesics (n=177), antianginals (n=35), and antihistamines (n=15). Use with Anticholinergics: Because of their mechanism of action, cholinesterase inhibitors have the potential to interfere with the activity of anticholinergic medications.

Reduce both the dose of levomepromazine and the dose of the other drug. If possible, avoid such combinations. Caffeine and/or stimulantes of the ephedrine/amphetamine type may counteract the specific actions of levomepromazine. Concomitant use of these substances should be avoided. Coffee and black tea should be avoided because they decrease the absorption of levomepromazine considerably.

The use of drugs that stimulate alpha-adrenergic receptors (e.g., phenylephrine, pseudoephedrine, ephedrine, phenylpropanolamine or dihydroergotamine) may enhance or potentiate the pressor effects of ProAmatine   . Therefore, caution should be used when ProAmatine    is administered concomitantly with agents that cause vasoconstriction. ProAmatine    has been used in patients concomitantly treated with salt-retaining steroid therapy (i.e., fludrocortisone acetate), with or without salt supplementation. The potential for supine hypertension should be carefully monitored in these patients and may be minimized by either reducing the dose of fludrocortisone acetate or decreasing the salt intake prior to initiation of treatment with. ProAmatine. Alpha-adrenergic blocking agents, such as prazosin, terazosin, and doxazosin, can antagonize the effects of ProAmatine. Potential for Drug Interactions: It appears possible, although there is no supporting experimental evidence, that the high renal clearance of desglymidodrine (a base) is due to active tubular secretion by the base-secreting system also responsible for the secretion of such drugs as metformin, cimetidine, ranitidine, procainamide, triamterene, flecainide, and quinidine.

Less potent inhibitors include saquinavir, nefazodone, fluconazole, grapefruit juice, fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, zileuton, and clotrimazole.

Cyclosporine: Preliminary data from a XENICAL and cyclosporine drug interaction study indicate a reduction in cyclosporine plasma levels when XENICAL was coadministered with cyclosporine. Digoxin: In 12 normal-weight subjects receiving XENICAL 120 mg three times a day for 6 days, XENICAL did not alter the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of digoxin. Fat-soluble Vitamin Supplements and Analogues: A pharmacokinetic interaction study showed a 30% reduction in beta-carotene supplement absorption when concomitantly administered with XENICAL. XENICAL inhibited absorption of a vitamin E acetate supplement by approximately 60%. The effect of orlistat on the absorption of supplemental vitamin D, vitamin A, and nutritionally-derived vitamin K is not known at this time. Glyburide: In 12 normal-weight subjects receiving orlistat 80 mg three times a day for 5 days, orlistat did not alter the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics (blood glucose-lowering) of glyburide. Nifedipine (extended-release tablets): In 17 normal-weight subjects receiving XENICAL 120 mg three times a day for 6 days, XENICAL did not alter the bioavailability of nifedipine (extended-release tablets). Oral Contraceptives: In 20 normal-weight female subjects, the treatment of XENICAL 120 mg three times a day for 23 days resulted in no changes in the ovulation-suppressing action of oral contraceptives. Phenytoin: In 12 normal-weight subjects receiving XENICAL 120 mg three times a day for 7 days, XENICAL did not alter the pharmacokinetics of a single 300-mg dose of phenytoin. Pravastatin: In a 2-way crossover study of 24 normal-weight, mildly hypercholesterolemic patients receiving XENICAL 120 mg three times a day for 6 days, XENICAL did not affect the pharmacokinetics of pravastatin. Warfarin: In 12 normal-weight subjects, administration of XENICAL 120 mg three times a day for 16 days did not result in any change in either warfarin pharmacokinetics (both R- and S-enantiomers) or pharmacodynamics (prothrombin time and serum Factor VII). Although undercarboxylated osteocalcin, a marker of vitamin K nutritional status, was unaltered with XENICAL administration, vitamin K levels tended to decline in subjects taking XENICAL. Therefore, as vitamin K absorption may be decreased with XENICAL, patients on chronic stable doses of warfarin who are prescribed XENICAL should be monitored closely for changes in coagulation parameters.",

Based on studies evaluating possible interactions of pantoprazole with other drugs, no dosage adjustment is needed with concomitant use of the following: theophylline, cisapride, antipyrine, caffeine, carbamazepine, diazepam (and its active metabolite, desmethyldiazepam), diclofenac, naproxen, piroxicam, digoxin, ethanol, glyburide, an oral contraceptive (levonorgestrel/ethinyl estradiol), metoprolol, nifedipine, phenytoin, warfarin, midazolam, clarithromycin, metronidazole, or amoxicillin. Clinically relevant interactions of pantoprazole with other drugs with the same metabolic pathways are not expected. Therefore, when coadministered with pantoprazole, adjustment of the dosage of pantoprazole or of such drugs may not be necessary. There was also no interaction with concomitantly administered antacids. There have been postmarketing reports of increased INR and prothrombin time in patients receiving proton pump inhibitors, including pantoprazole, and warfarin concomitantly. Increases in INR and prothrombin time may lead to abnormal bleeding and even death. Patients treated with proton pump inhibitors and warfarin concomitantly should be monitored for increases in INR and prothrombin time. Because of profound and long lasting inhibition of gastric acid secretion, pantoprazole may interfere with absorption of drugs where gastric pH is an important determinant of their bioavailability (eg, ketoconazole, ampicillin esters, and iron salts). Laboratory Tests There have been reports of false-positive urine screening tests for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in patients receiving most proton pump inhibitors, including pantoprazole. An alternative confirmatory method should be considered to verify positive results.",

Dosage of the anticoagulant may have to be decreased in order to maintain desired prothrombin time. Patients receiving oral anticoagulant therapy require close monitoring, especially when anabolic steroids are started or stopped. Warfarin: A multidose study of oxandrolone, given as 5 or 10 mg BID in 15 healthy subjects concurrently treated with warfarin, resulted in a mean increase in S-warfarin half-life from 26 to 48 hours and AUC from 4.55 to 12.08 ng*hr/mL: similar increases in R-warfarin half-life and AUC were also detected. Microscopic hematuria (9/15) and gingival bleeding (1/15) were also observed. A 5.5-fold decrease in the mean warfarin dose from 6.13 mg/day to 1.13 mg/day (approximately 80-85% reduction of warfarin dose), was necessary to maintain a target INR of 1.5. When oxandrolone therapy is initiated in a patient already receiving treatment with warfarin, the INR or prothrombin time (PT) should be monitored closely and the dose of warfarin adjusted as necessary until a stable target INR or PT has been achieved. Furthermore, in patients receiving both drugs, careful monitoring of the INR or PT, and adjustment of the warfarin dosage if indicated are recommended when the oxandrolone dose is changed or discontinued. Patients should be closely monitored for signs and symptoms of occult bleeding. Oral hypoglycemic agents Oxandrolone may inhibit the metabolism of oral hypoglycemic agents. Adrenal steroids or ACTH In patients with edema, concomitant administration with adrenal cortical steroids or ACTH may increase the edema.

Drugs Affecting Hepatic Metabolism The metabolism and pharmacokinetics of REMERON SolTab    (mirtazapine) Orally Disintegrating Tablets may be affected by the induction or inhibition of drug-metab-olizing enzymes. Drugs that are Metabolized by and/or Inhibit Cytochrome P450 Enzymes Many drugs are metabolized by and/or inhibit various cytochrome P450 enzymes, e.g., 2D6, 1A2, 3A4, etc. In vitro studies have shown that mirtazapine is a substrate for several of these enzymes, including 2D6, 1A2, and 3A4. While in vitro studies have shown that mirtazapine is not a potent inhibitor of any of these enzymes, an indication that mirtazapine is not likely to have a clinically significant inhibitory effect on the metabolism of other drugs that are substrates for these cytochrome P450 enzymes, the concomitant use of REMERON SolTab with most other drugs metabolized by these enzymes has not been formally studied. Consequently, it is not possible to make any definitive statements about the risks of coadministration of REMERON SolTab    with such drugs. Alcohol: Concomitant administration of alcohol (equivalent to 60 g) had a minimal effect on plasma levels of mirtazapine (15 mg) in 6 healthy male subjects. However, the impairment of cognitive and motor skills produced by REMERON    were shown to be additive with those produced by alcohol. Accordingly, patients should be advised to avoid alcohol while taking REMERON SolTab. Diazepam: Concomitant administration of diazepam (15 mg) had a minimal effect on plasma levels of mirtazapine (15 mg) in 12 healthy subjects. However, the impairment of motor skills produced by REMERON has been shown to be additive with those caused by diazepam. Accordingly, patients should be advised to avoid diazepam and other similar drugs while taking REMERON SolTab.",

Patients received a single panobinostat oral dose on day 1, followed by 4  days wash-out period. On days 5-9, ketoconazole was administered. On day 8, a single panobinostat dose was co-administered with ketoconazole. Panobinostat was administered as single agent three times a week on day 15 and onward. In the presence of ketoconazole, there was 1.6- and 1.8-fold increase in C (max) and AUC of panobinostat, respectively. No substantial change in T (max) or half-life was observed. No difference in panobinostat-pharmacokinetics between patients carrying CYP3A5*1/*3 and CYP3A5*3/*3 alleles was observed. Most frequently reported adverse events were gastrointestinal related. Patients had asymptomatic hypophosphatemia (64%), and urine analysis suggested renal phosphate wasting. Co-administration of panobinostat with CYP3A inhibitors is feasible as the observed increase in panobinostat PK parameters was not considered clinically relevant. Considering the variability in exposure following enzyme inhibition and the fact that chronic dosing of panobinostat was not studied with CYP3A inhibitors, close monitoring of panobinostat-related adverse events is necessary.",

        "abstract": "Antidepressant-warfarin interaction and associated gastrointestinal bleeding risk in a case-control study. Bleeding is the most common and worrisome adverse effect of warfarin therapy. One of the factors that might increase bleeding risk is initiation of interacting drugs that potentiate warfarin. We sought to evaluate whether initiation of an antidepressant increases the risk of hospitalization for gastrointestinal bleeding in warfarin users. Medicaid claims data (1999-2005) were used to perform an observational case-control study nested within person-time exposed to warfarin in those   18 years. In total, 430,455 warfarin users contributed 407,370 person-years of warfarin use. The incidence rate of hospitalization for GI bleeding among warfarin users was 4.48 per 100 person-years (95% CI, 4.42-4.55). Each gastrointestinal bleeding cases was matched to 50 controls based on index date and state. Warfarin users had an increased odds ratio of gastrointestinal bleeding upon initiation of citalopram (OR   =   1.73 [95% CI, 1.25-2.38]), fluoxetine (OR   =   1.63 [95% CI, 1.11-2.38]), paroxetine (OR   =   1.64 [95% CI, 1.27-2.12]), amitriptyline (OR   =   1.47 [95% CI, 1.02-2.11]). Also mirtazapine, which is not believed to interact with warfarin, increased the risk of GI bleeding (OR   =   1.75 [95% CI, 1.30-2.35]). Warfarin users who initiated citalopram, fluoxetine, paroxetine, amitriptyline, or mirtazapine had an increased risk of hospitalization for gastrointestinal bleeding. However, the elevated risk with mirtazapine suggests that a drug-drug interaction may not have been responsible for all of the observed increased risk.",

In vitro studies have identified cyclosporine and tacrolimus as CYP3A inhibitors. In the current study in renal allograft recipients, we used intravenously and orally administered midazolam as a drug probe to assess whether the study drugs at doses that are generally used in clinical practice have differential effects on in vivo hepatic and first-pass CYP3A activities. Systemic and apparent oral midazolam clearance were 24% (269    73 vs. 354    102  ml/min, P = 0.022) and 31% (479    190 vs. 688    265  ml/min, P = 0.013), respectively, lower in cyclosporine-treated patients (n = 20) than in matched tacrolimus-treated patients (n = 20). The latter displayed midazolam clearances similar to those in two larger cohorts of nonmatched tacrolimus-treated patients (n = 58 and n = 80) and to those receiving a calcineurin inhibitor-free regimen (n = 6). This implies that in vivo hepatic and first-pass CYP3A activities are significantly lower in patients receiving cyclosporine than in those receiving tacrolimus, indicating that, at the doses generally used in clinical practice, cyclosporine is the stronger of the two with respect to CYP3A inhibition. This observation has important implications in the context of drug-drug interactions in transplant recipients.",

        "abstract": "Influence of piperine on ibuprofen induced antinociception and its pharmacokinetics. Piperine (CAS 94-62-2), an alkaloid obtained from Piper nigrum and P. longum, is a known inhibitor of various enzymes (CYP isozymes) responsible for biotransformation of drugs. By inhibiting the metabolism of drugs, piperine improves the bioavailability of drugs. In the present study piperine (10 mg/kg) significantly increased the dose-dependent antinociceptive activity of ibuprofen evaluated by both acetic acid writhing and formalin test, when it was administered with ibuprofen. Ibuprofen plasma concentration was also increased when it was administered with piperine. The synergistic antinociception activity of ibuprofen when administered with piperine can be attributed to increased plasma concentration of ibuprofen. From this study it can be concluded that piperine can be used as a bioenhancer along with ibuprofen.",

The biotransformation and oxidative stress may contribute to 1,2:3,4-diepoxybutane (DEB)-induced toxicity to human lymphocytes of Fanconi Anemia (FA) patients. Thus, the identification of putative inhibitors of bioactivation, as well as the determination of the protective role of oxidant defenses, on DEB-induced toxicity, can help to understand what is failing in FA cells. In the present work we studied the contribution of several biochemical pathways for DEB-induced acute toxicity in human lymphocyte suspensions, by using inhibitors of epoxide hydrolases, inhibitors of protective enzymes as glutathione S-transferase and catalase, the depletion of glutathione (GSH), and the inhibition of protein synthesis; and a variety of putative protective compounds, including antioxidants, and mitochondrial protective agents. The present study reports two novel findings: (i) it was clearly evidenced, for the first time, that the acute exposure of freshly isolated human lymphocytes to DEB results in severe GSH depletion and loss of ATP, followed by cell death; (ii) acetyl-l-carnitine elicits a significant protective effect on DEB induced toxicity, which was potentiated by  alpha-lipoic acid. Collectively, these findings contribute to increase our knowledge of DEB-induce toxicity and will be very useful when applied in studies with lymphocytes from FA patients, in order to find out a protective agent against spontaneous and DEB-induced chromosome instability.",

        "abstract": "Improved parathyroid hormone control by cinacalcet is associated with reduction in darbepoetin requirement in patients with end-stage renal disease. Uncontrolled hy-per-parathyroidism causes bone marrow fibrosis, leading to erythropoietin (EPO) resistance. Medical treatment with cinacalcet is effective in reducing plasma parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, but its effect on darbepoetin dosing is unknown. METHODS AND AIMS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 40 end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients (age: 55    14; mean    SD; 21:male) who had at least 12 months of cinacalcet therapy. The distribution of renal replacement therapies were: 14 peritoneal dialysis, 18 conventional hemodialysis and 8 nocturnal hemodialysis. Standard dialysis related biochemical indices and medications used were recorded. The primary objective of the study was to ascertain the difference in darbepoetin responsiveness before and after 12 months of cinacalcet therapy. Our secondary objective was to determine if there was a relationship between the changes in PTH and darbepoetin requirement. Overall, PTH levels decreased from 197.5 (151.8; 249.2) to 66.1 (41.2; 136.5) (median (25th;75th percentile)) pmol/l; p &lt; 0.001. Cinacalcet dose increased from 30.0   6 to 63   25 mg/day, p < 0.05. Hemoglobin remained unchanged (116   13 to 116   13 g/l), while darbepoetin requirement decreased from 40 (20; 60) to 24 (19; 59)   g/week, p = 0.02. The remainder of the dialysis-related biochemistry (electrolytes, calcium, phosphate, iron status) and vitamin D use remained unchanged. A reduction in PTH level of greater than 30% was experienced by 82.5% (33/40) of our cohort. Among the responders, the fall in PTH and reduction darbepoetin requirement were related (R = -0.48, p = 0.004). Reduction of PTH by cinacalcet is associated with a decrease in darbepoetin requirement. The interface between bone and bone marrow in uremia represents a critical step in red blood cell production which merits further investigation.",

Celecoxib, an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase-2, is being investigated for enhancement of chemotherapy efficacy in cancer clinical trials. This study investigates the ability of cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors to sensitize cells from different origins to several chemotherapeutic agents. The effect of the drug's mechanism of action and sequence of administration are also investigated. The sensitivity, cell cycle, apoptosis and DNA damage of five different cancer cell lines (HeLa, HCT116, HepG2, MCF7 and U251) to 5-FU, cisplatin, doxorubicin and etoposide   celecoxib following different incubation schedules were analyzed. We found antagonism between celecoxib and the four drugs in the breast cancer cells MCF7 following all incubation schedules and between celecoxib and doxorubicin in all cell lines except for two combinations in HCT116 cells. Celecoxib with the other three drugs in the remaining four cell lines resulted in variable interactions. Mechanistic investigations revealed that celecoxib exerts different molecular effects in different cells. In some lines, it abrogates the drug-induced G2/M arrest enhancing pre-mature entry into mitosis with damaged DNA thus increasing apoptosis and resulting in synergism. In other cells, it enhances drug-induced G2/M arrest allowing time to repair drug-induced DNA damage before entry into mitosis and decreasing cell death resulting in antagonism. In some synergistic combinations, celecoxib-induced abrogation of G2/M arrest was not associated with apoptosis but permanent arrest in G1 phase. These results, if confirmed in-vivo, indicate that celecoxib is not a suitable chemosensitizer for breast cancer or with doxorubicin for other cancers. Moreover, combination of celecoxib with other drugs should be tailored to the tumor type, drug and administration schedule.",

Neonatal quinpirole treatment has been shown to produce an increase in dopamine D2-like receptor sensitivity that persists throughout the subject's lifetime. The objective was to analyze the effects of neonatal quinpirole treatment on effects of amphetamine in adolescent rats using locomotor sensitization and conditioned place preference procedures. Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with quinpirole (1 mg/kg) or saline from postnatal days (P)1 to P11 and raised to adolescence. For locomotor sensitization, subjects were given amphetamine (1 mg/kg) or saline every second day from P35 to P47 and were placed into a locomotor arena. In female rats, neonatal quinpirole treatment enhanced amphetamine locomotor sensitization compared with quinpirole-free controls sensitized to amphetamine. Male rats demonstrated sensitization to amphetamine, although this was muted compared with female rats, and were unaffected by neonatal quinpirole. For conditioned place preference, subjects were conditioned for 8 consecutive days (P32-39) with amphetamine (1 mg/kg) or saline and a drug-free preference test was conducted at P40. Rats treated with neonatal quinpirole enhanced time spent in the amphetamine-paired context compared with quinpirole-free controls conditioned with amphetamine, but only female controls conditioned with amphetamine spent more time in the drug-paired context compared with saline-treated controls. Increased D   -like receptor sensitivity appears to have enhanced the behavioral effects of amphetamine, but these effects were more prevalent in adolescent female rats compared with male rats.",

The drug interaction between proton pump inhibitors and clopidogrel has been the subject of much study in recent years. Contradictory results regarding the effect of proton pump inhibitors on platelet reactivity and on clinical outcome in clopidogrel-treated patients have been reported in literature. Concomitant use of omeprazole and clopidogrel was found to decrease the exposure (AUC) to clopidogrel's active metabolite by 50% and to sharply increase platelet reactivity, as a result of inhibition by omeprazole of CYP2C19, a cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzyme. Pantoprazole has a much weaker effect on clopidogrel's pharmacokinetics and on platelet reactivity during concomitant use. The influence of the other proton pump inhibitors when used simultaneously with clopidogrel has not yet been investigated in adequately randomized studies. Regulatory agencies state that the combination of clopidogrel and the CYP2C19 inhibitors omeprazole and esomeprazole should be avoided. To date, there is no conclusive evidence of a clinically-relevant interaction between any of the proton pump inhibitors and clopidogrel.",

Calcium is the only known component in the diet that may affect absorption of both nonheme and heme iron.

Our objective was to establish potential effects of calcium on absorption of nonheme and heme iron and the dose response for this effect in the absence of a meal. Fifty-four healthy, nonpregnant women were selected to participate in 4 iron absorption studies using iron radioactive tracers. We evaluated the effects of calcium doses between 200 and 1500 mg on absorption of 5 mg nonheme iron (as ferrous sulfate). We also evaluated the effects of calcium doses between 200 and 800 mg on absorption of 5 mg heme iron [as concentrated RBC (CRBC)]. Calcium was administered as calcium chloride in all studies and minerals were ingested on an empty stomach. Calcium doses   1000 mg diminished nonheme iron absorption by an average of 49.6%. A calcium dose of 800 mg diminished absorption of 5 mg heme iron by 37.7%. In conclusion, we demonstrated an isolated effect of calcium (as chloride) on absorption of 5 mg of iron provided as nonheme (as sulfate) and heme (as CRBC) iron.

The aim of the present study was to investigate whether HB-EGF is a therapeutic target for T-ALL, and to further elucidate the antitumor effects of a specific inhibitor of HB-EGF, cross-reacting material 197 (CRM197). We elucidated the expression of HB-EGF in T-ALL cell lines, and evaluated the effect of CRM197 on these cells alone or in combination with anticancer agent. The expression of EGFR and EGFR ligands was determined by flow cytometry, RT-PCR and real-time quantitative PCR. Induction of apoptosis was assessed by TUNEL assay. HB-EGF was strongly expressed by T-ALL cell lines, and the expression of both HB-EGF and EGFR was enhanced by doxorubicin. CRM197 induced apoptosis, and furthermore, the combination of CRM197 plus doxorubicin enhanced cytotoxicity in a T-ALL cell line.

        "abstract": "Synergistic interaction between sunitinib and docetaxel is sequence dependent in human non-small lung cancer with EGFR TKIs-resistant mutation. Previous studies have demonstrated that sunitinib has the anti-tumor activity in human non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). This study was aimed to investigate the efficacy of single use of sunitinib and that of concurrent or sequential administration of sunitinib and docetaxel in NSCLC cell lines that are resistant to EGFR TKIs. NSCLC cell lines with EGFR T790M mutation and K-ras mutation were exposed to either sunitinib or docetaxel or both based on various sequential administrations. After exposure, the cell viability was measured by MTT assay, cell cycle distribution was analyzed by flow cytometry, and alterations in signaling pathway were determined by immunoblotting. Sunitinib exhibited dose-dependent growth inhibition in NSCLC cell lines and arrested cell cycle at G1 phase, whereas docetaxel arrested at S phase. Although single or concurrent use of sunitinib and docetaxel has some anti-proliferative effects, the sequential administrations of both drugs remarkably enhanced anti-tumor activity. When cells were exposed to docetaxel followed by sunitinib, synergism was observed. The molecular basis of this synergism is that the signaling pathways that were initially activated by docetaxel exposure were efficiently suppressed by the subsequent exposure to sunitinib. In contrast, the reverse of this sequential administration resulted in antagonism, which may be due to differential effects on cell cycle arrest. Sunitinib as a single agent exhibits anti-proliferative effects in vitro in NSCLC cell lines with EGFR T790M and K-ras mutations but the sequential administration of docetaxel followed by sunitinib is superior to sunitinib followed by docetaxel and concurrent administration.",

Effective strategies are needed to enhance paclitaxel sensitivity. A library of silencing RNAs (siRNAs) was used to identify kinases that regulate paclitaxel sensitivity in human ovarian cancer SKOv3 cells. The effect of dasatinib, an inhibitor of Src and Abl kinases, on paclitaxel sensitivity was measured in ovarian cancer cells and HEY xenografts. The roles of p27(Kip1), Bcl-2, and Cdk1 in apoptosis induced by dasatinib and paclitaxel were assessed using a terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay, siRNA knockdown of gene expression, transfection with Bcl-2 and Cdk1 expression vectors, and flow cytometry. All statistical tests were two-sided. Src family and Abl kinases were identified as modulators of paclitaxel sensitivity in SKOv3 cells. The siRNA knockdown of Src, Fyn, or Abl1 enhanced paclitaxel-mediated growth inhibition in ovarian cancer cells compared with a control siRNA. HEY cells treated with dasatinib plus paclitaxel formed fewer colonies than did cells treated with either agent alone. Treatment of HEY xenograft-bearing mice with dasatinib plus paclitaxel inhibited tumor growth more than treatment with either agent alone (average tumor volume per mouse, dasatinib + paclitaxel vs paclitaxel: 0.28 vs. 0.81 cm3, difference = 0.53 cm3, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.44 to 0.62 cm3, P = .014); dasatinib + paclitaxel vs. dasatinib: 0.28 vs. 0.55 cm3, difference = 0.27 cm3, 95% CI = 0.21 to 0.33 cm3, P = .035). Combined treatment induced more TUNEL-positive apoptotic cells than did either agent alone. The siRNA knockdown of p27(Kip1) decreased dasatinib- and paclitaxel-induced apoptosis compared with a negative control siRNA (sub-G1 fraction, control siRNA vs. p27(Kip1) siRNA: 42.5% vs. 20.1%, difference = 22.4%, 95% CI = 20.1% to 24.7%, P = .017). Studies with forced expression and siRNA knockdown of Bcl-2 and Cdk1 suggest that dasatinib-mediated induction of p27(Kip1) enhanced paclitaxel-induced apoptosis by negatively regulating Bcl-2 and Cdk1 expression. Inhibition of Src family and Abl kinases with either siRNAs or dasatinib enhances paclitaxel sensitivity of ovarian cancer cells through p27(Kip1)-mediated suppression of Bcl-2 and Cdk1 expression.",

This study examined drug-drug interactions of oral S-ketamine with the cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2B6 inhibitor ticlopidine and the CYP3A inhibitor itraconazole. In this randomized, blinded, crossover study, 11 healthy volunteers ingested 0.2 mg/kg S-ketamine after pretreatments with oral ticlopidine (250 mg twice daily), itraconazole (200 mg once daily), or placebo in 6-day treatment periods at intervals of 4 weeks. Ticlopidine treatment increased the mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve extrapolated to infinity (AUC(0-   )) of oral ketamine by 2.4-fold, whereas itraconazole treatment did not increase the exposure to S-ketamine. The ratio of norketamine AUC(0-   ) to ketamine AUC(0-   ) was significantly decreased in the ticlopidine (P &lt; 0.001) and itraconazole phases (P = 0.006) as compared to placebo. In the ticlopidine and itraconazole phases, the areas under the effect-time curves (self-reported drowsiness and performance) were significantly higher than those in the placebo phase (P < 0.05).

Degeneration of the dopaminergic nigrostriatal system and of noradrenergic neurons in the locus coeruleus are important pathological features of Parkinson's disease. There is an urgent need to develop therapies that slow down the progression of neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease. In the present study, we tested whether the highly specific metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 antagonist, 3-[(2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl) ethynyl] pyridine, reduces dopaminergic and noradrenergic neuronal loss in monkeys rendered parkinsonian by chronic treatment with low doses of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine. Weekly intramuscular 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine injections (0.2-0.5 mg/kg body weight), in combination with daily administration of 3-[(2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl) ethynyl] pyridine or vehicle, were performed until the development of parkinsonian motor symptoms in either of the two experimental groups (1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine/3-[(2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl) ethynyl] pyridine versus 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine/vehicle). After 21 weeks of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine treatment, all 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine/vehicle-treated animals displayed parkinsonian symptoms, whereas none of the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine/3-[(2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl) ethynyl] pyridine-treated monkeys were significantly affected. These behavioural observations were consistent with in vivo positron emission tomography dopamine transporter imaging data, and with post-mortem stereological counts of midbrain dopaminergic neurons, as well as striatal intensity measurements of dopamine transporter and tyrosine hydroxylase immunoreactivity, which were all significantly higher in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine/3-[(2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl) ethynyl] pyridine-treated animals than in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine/vehicle-treated monkeys. The 3-[(2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl) ethynyl] pyridine treatment also had a significant effect on the 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine-induced loss of norepinephrine neurons in the locus coeruleus and adjoining A5 and A7 noradrenaline cell groups. In 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine/vehicle-treated animals, almost 40% loss of tyrosine hydroxylase-positive norepinephrine neurons was found in locus coeruleus/A5/A7 noradrenaline cell groups, whereas the extent of neuronal loss was lower than 15% of control values in 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine/3-[(2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl) ethynyl] pyridine-treated monkeys. Our data demonstrate that chronic treatment with the metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 antagonist, 3-[(2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl) ethynyl] pyridine, significantly reduces 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine toxicity towards dopaminergic and noradrenergic cell groups in non-human primates. This suggests that the use of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 antagonists may be a useful strategy to reduce degeneration of catecholaminergic neurons in Parkinson's disease.",

        "abstract": "Determinants of sensitivity to DZNep induced apoptosis in multiple myeloma cells. The 3-Deazaneplanocin A (DZNep), one of S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy) hydrolase inhibitors, has shown antitumor activities in a broad range of solid tumors and acute myeloid leukemia. Here, we examined its effects on multiple myeloma (MM) cells and found that, at 500 nM, it potently inhibited growth and induced apoptosis in 2 of 8 MM cell lines. RNA from un-treated and DZNep treated cells was profiled by Affymetrix HG-U133 Plus 2.0 microarray and genes with a significant change in gene expression were determined by significance analysis of microarray (SAM) testing. ALOX5 was the most down-regulated gene (5.8-fold) in sensitive cells and was expressed at low level in resistant cells. The results were corroborated by quantitative RT-PCR. Western-blot analysis indicated ALOX5 was highly expressed only in sensitive cell line H929 and greatly decreased upon DZNep treatment. Ectopic expression of ALOX5 reduced sensitivity to DZNep in H929 cells. Furthermore, down-regulation of ALOX5 by RNA interference could also induce apoptosis in H929. Gene expression analysis on MM patient dataset indicated ALOX5 expression was significantly higher in MM patients compared to normal plasma cells. We also found that Bcl-2 was overexpressed in DZNep insensitive cells, and cotreatment with DZNep and ABT-737, a Bcl-2 family inhibitor, synergistically inhibited growth and induced apoptosis of DZNep insensitive MM cells. Taken together, this study shows one of mechanisms of the DZNep efficacy on MM correlates with its ability to down-regulate the ALOX5 levels. In addition, DZNep insensitivity might be associated with overexpression of Bcl-2, and the combination of ABT-737 and DZNep could synergistically induced apoptosis. These results suggest that DZNep may be exploited therapeutically for a subset of MM.",

It is extensively transformed into its active metabolites by the cytochrome P450 enzyme system, especially into endoxifen by isoenzyme CYP 2D6. Co-administration of tamoxifen with isoenzyme CYP 2D6 inhibitors reduces this metabolism. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants inhibit isoenzyme CYP 2D6. Paroxetine and fluoxetine reduce the plasma concentration of endoxifen by about 50%.

Other studies, with a lower level of evidence, were less convincing. Studies of other isoenzyme CYP 2D6 inhibitors showed no increase in the risk of breast cancer recurrence, but they lacked statistical power. It is better to avoid prescribing isoenzyme CYP 2D6 inhibitors to women treated with tamoxifen for breast cancer, especially SSRI antidepressants such as paroxetine and fluoxetine. Depression does not always require antidepressant drug therapy, and antidepressants have no proven preventive impact on hot flushes linked to the menopause.

The colic drops were immediately discontinued and TSH promptly normalised with a reduction in thyroxine requirement to an age appropriate dosage. Drug interaction of thyroxine with simeticone has not been reported previously and is not listed in the British National Formulary for Children. Clinicians and parents need to be aware of this interaction to avoid unnecessary undertreatment and prevent potential long-term neurological sequelae.",

Although it was previously reported that lapatinib combined with Herceptin improved the progression-free survival rate compared with lapatinib alone for patients with Herceptin-refractory HER2-positive metastatic breast cancer, the mechanism is purported to be an antiproliferative effect relating to the synergism of these two agents. We evaluated how lapatinib interacts with Herceptin in HER2-positive breast cancer, with a particular focus on Herceptin-mediated antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC). In an in vitro assay, lapatinib induced HER2 expression at the cell surface of HER2-positive breast cancer cell lines, leading to the enhancement of Herceptin-mediated ADCC. Furthermore, we present a case report in which a second Herceptin treatment following lapatinib resulted in the marked shrinkage of multiple metastatic tumors in HER2-positive breast cancer. Lapatinib may have the potential to convert Herceptin-refractory to Herceptin-sensitive tumors in HER2-positive breast cancer by up-regulation of the cell surface expression of HER2.",

All patients had indications for antihypertensive therapy and were randomized either to fixed combination amlodipine/valsartan (n=43) or to therapy which corresponded to the hospital formulary (n=43). Correction of antihypertensive therapy was performed by treating physician at daily rounds. Self-control of blood pressure (BP) was performed by patients with the use of UA767PC apparatus. Results of BP self-control were compared with clinical measurements in order to detect concealed inefficacy of treatment. Results. Rate of achievement of target BP with fixed combination amlodipine/valsartan (93%) was comparable with that on traditional therapy (90%). But the use of fixed combination amlodipine/valsartan compared with traditional therapy was associated with lower clinical and self measured BP, quicker achievement of target BP (5.8+/-2.3 and 9.2+/-1.8 days, respectively, 0.05), lesser number of antihypertensive drugs (2.5+/-0.6 and 3.0+/-0.9 days, respectively), lower rate of concealed inefficacy of treatment (12 and 31%, respectively, 0.05). Conclusions. We have demonstrated appropriateness of inhospital administration of fixed amlodipine/valsartan combination as an approach allowing to achieve target BP in shorter time, with the use of fewer antihypertensive drugs, and diminishing concealed inefficacy of treatment.",

        "abstract": "Effects of CYP inhibitors on precocene I metabolism and toxicity in rat liver slices. We present a comprehensive in vitro approach to assessing metabolism-mediated hepatotoxicity using male Sprague-Dawley rat liver slices incubated with the well characterized hepatotoxicant, precocene I, and inhibitors of cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes. This approach combines liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC MS) detection methods with multiple toxicity endpoints to enable identification of critical metabolic pathways for hepatotoxicity. The incubations were performed in the absence and presence of the non-specific CYP inhibitor, 1-aminobenzotriazole (ABT) and isoform-specific inhibitors. The metabolite profile of precocene I in rat liver slices shares some features of the in vivo profile, but also had a major difference in that epoxide dihydrodiol hydrolysis products were not observed to a measurable extent. As examples of our liver slice metabolite identification procedure, a minor glutathione adduct and previously unreported 7-O-desmethyl and glucuronidated metabolites of precocene I are reported. Precocene I induced hepatocellular necrosis in a dose- and time-dependent manner. ABT decreased the toxicity of precocene I, increased exposure to parent compound, and decreased metabolite levels in a dose-dependent manner. Of the isoform-specific CYP inhibitors tested for an effect on the precocene I metabolite profile, only tranylcypromine was noticeably effective, indicating a role of CYPs 2A6, 2C9, 2Cl9, and 2E1. With respect to toxicity, the order of CYP inhibitor effectiveness was ABT>diethyldithiocarbamate~tranylcypromine>ketoconazole. Furafylline and sulfaphenazole had no effect, while quinidine appeared to augment precocene I toxicity. These results suggest that rat liver slices do not reproduce the reported in vivo biotransformation of precocene I and therefore may not be an appropriate model for precocene I metabolism. However, these results provide an example of how small molecule manipulation of CYP activity in an in vitro model can be used to confirm metabolism-mediated toxicity.",

To determine whether the co-injection of extracellular matrix degrading enzymes improves retinal transduction following intravitreal delivery of adeno-associated virus-2 (AAV2). AAV2 containing cDNA encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP), under the control of a chicken   -actin promoter, was delivered by intravitreal injection to adult mice in conjunction with enzymes including collagenase, hyaluronan lyase, heparinase III, or chondroitin ABC lyase. Two weeks later, retinal flatmounts were examined for GFP expression using confocal microscopy. Without the addition of enzymes, transduction was limited to occasional cells in the retinal ganglion cell layer. The addition of heparinase III or chondroitin ABC lyase greatly enhanced transduction of the retinal ganglion cell layer and increased the depth of transduction into the outer retina. Hyaluronan lyase had a limited effect and collagenase was ineffective. Electroretinograms survived with higher concentrations of heparinase III and chondroitin ABC lyase than were required for optimal retinal transduction. AAV2-mediated retinal transduction is improved by co-injection of heparinase III or chondroitin ABC lyase. Improved transduction efficiency may allow intravitreal injection to become the preferred route for delivering gene therapy to both the inner and outer retina.",
