The relation between indomethacin and hypotension is not clear, but it may be due to a direct effect of indomethacin on the vascular smooth muscle or to an effect of indomethacin on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which is known to be involved in the pathogenesis of indomethacin-induced hypotension in patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) and in patients with normal renal function (NRF). (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) The present study was designed to investigate the effect of indomethacin on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system in patients with CRF and in patients with NRF.

The relation between sodium and hypotension is not well understood, but it has been suggested that sodium may play a role in the pathogenesis of hypotension in patients with renal insufficiency and in those with congestive heart failure (CHF), both of which are associated with increased sympathetic nervous system (SNS) activity and increased plasma norepinephrine (NE) levels, and that sodium depletion may be a factor in the development of hypotension in these patients. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) The purpose of this study was to investigate the relation between sodium and hypotension in patients with renal insufficiency and in those with CHF.
