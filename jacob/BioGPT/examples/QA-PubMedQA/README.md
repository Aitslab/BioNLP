# Question Answering on PubMedQA in Reasoning Required Setting

## Data
Download data from [PubMedQA](https://github.com/pubmedqa/pubmedqa) and following the steps of splitting dataset.

Copy the files `pqal_fold0/train_set.json`, `pqal_fold0/dev_set.json`, `test_set.json` and `test_ground_truth.json` to `../../data/PubMedQA/raw`

Then, you can process the data by:
``` bash
bash preprocess.sh # for BioGPT
```
or 
``` bash
bash preprocess_large.sh # for BioGPT-Large
```


## Model Checkpoint
We provide our fine-tuned model on the task. See [here](../../README.md#pre-trained-models)

## Inference and Evaluating
You can inference and evaluate the model on the test set by:
``` bash
bash infer.sh # for BioGPT
```
or 
``` bash
bash infer_large.sh # for BioGPT-Large
```
