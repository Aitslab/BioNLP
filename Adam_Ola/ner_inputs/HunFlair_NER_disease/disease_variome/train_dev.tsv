Through	O

that	O

particularly	O
for	O

with	O
a	O
low	O

it	O
may	O

the	O

A	O

conclusion	O

that	O
there	O
may	O
be	O
more	O
similarity	O
among	O

therefore	O

any	O
comparison	O
of	O
biological	O
changes	O
between	O

need	O
to	O
account	O
for	O

effects	O
in	O

ones	O

Clearly	O
,	O
the	O
same	O
tumor	B
suppressor	O
genes	O
in	O
different	O
cancers	B
may	O
undergo	O
different	O
modes	O
of	O
inactivation	O
.	O

This	O
scenario	O
is	O
analogous	O
to	O
the	O
situation	O
that	O
is	O
observed	O
for	O
oncogenes	O
such	O
as	O

the	O

The	O
processes	O

these	O

are	O
fundamentally	O

for	O

are	O

Finally	O

it	O
is	O
important	O
to	O

that	O
our	O

the	O
