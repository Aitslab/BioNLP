The	O
reason	O
for	O
the	O
low	O

may	O
be	O
due	O
to	O
the	O
use	O
of	O
electron	O

for	O
detection	O
.	O

Excess	O
fragmentation	O
under	O
the	O

significantly	O
reduced	O
the	O
assay	O

Moreover	O
,	O
POH	O

its	O
metabolites	O
such	O
as	O

still	O
rather	O
polar	O

Tailing	O

their	O
GC	O
peaks	O
may	O
also	O
reduce	O
the	O

The	O
present	O
method	O
used	O
a	O
soft	O
ammonia	O
chemical	O
ionization	O
,	O
which	O
could	O
reduce	O
fragmentation	O
and	O
increase	O
the	O
relative	O
abundance	O
of	O
the	O
ion	O
.	O

Additionally	O
,	O
we	O
also	O
found	O
that	O
BSTFA	O
derivatization	O
of	O
POH	O
and	O
its	O
metabolites	O
reduced	O
tailing	O
and	O
further	O
reduced	O
fragmentation	O
and	O
enhanced	O
sensitivity	O
.	O

Another	O
improvement	O
of	O
our	O
analytical	O
method	O
was	O
to	O
use	O
the	O
stable	O
isotopically	O

PA	O
as	O
the	O
internal	O
standard	O
that	O
provided	O
the	O

Thus	O
,	O
the	O
