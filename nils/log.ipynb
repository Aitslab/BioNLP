I tried following the setup, but being on the train with limited internet connection I ran into several problems. Read more about older pytorch and tensorflow versions and their compatibilities with different versions of CUDA/cuDNN, and realized that my desktop GPU may not be compatible with older versions. I'll have to look into this further when I get home. \n",

    "Had big struggles getting tensorflow to work properly due to older version being incompatable rtx30xx gpus (tf 1.15 only works with cuda 10 and the gpus with cuda 11). Found some potential workarounds but they only worked on linux and my linux boot is not stable atm and I'm most likely going to reinstall it again from scratch, which doesn't seem like a priority. After further investigation of the code, it appears that this part of the project mostly uses pytorch and tf is used for another part of the complete projekt, namely NER-tagging. I decided on letting tf run on cpu for now and instead focus on actually setting up the pipeline.\n",
