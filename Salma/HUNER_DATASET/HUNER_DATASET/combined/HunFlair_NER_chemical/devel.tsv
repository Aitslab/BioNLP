presumably	O
because	O

[	O

.	O

The	O
reason	O
for	O
the	O

may	O
be	O
due	O
to	O
the	O
use	O

for	O

Excess	O

under	O

its	O

still	O

Tailing	O

may	O
also	O
reduce	O
the	O

The	O
present	O
method	O
used	O
a	O
soft	O
ammonia	B
chemical	O
ionization	O

which	O
could	O
reduce	O
fragmentation	O
and	O
increase	O
the	O
relative	O
abundance	O
of	O
the	O
ion	O
.	O

Additionally	O
,	O
we	O
also	O
found	O
that	O
BSTFA	B
derivatization	O
of	O
POH	B
and	O
its	O
metabolites	B
reduced	O
tailing	O
and	O
further	O
reduced	O
fragmentation	O
and	O
enhanced	O
sensitivity	O
.	O

Another	O
improvement	O
of	O
our	O
analytical	O

was	O
to	O
use	O
