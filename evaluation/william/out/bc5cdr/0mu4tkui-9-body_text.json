   "text": "Respiratory and fecal samples were centrifuged (10,000 g) and 150 ml of the supernatant was mixed with 50ml Dynabeads protein A and G (1:1, Invitrogen). After 20 minutes incubation, 10 ml of autologous convalescent serum of the patient was added to the mixture (Table 1) . After a 20 minutes incubation with continuous shaking at room temperature, samples were washed six times with PBS using a magnetic particle concentrator. Universal transport medium with TURBO TM DNase (2U/ml, Ambion) was added to the antibody-antigen complex and samples were incubated at 37uC for 30 minutes. The complexes were lysed with Boom-lysis buffer L6 and the lysate was used as input for Boom extraction [14] , followed by VIDISCA-454 sequencing as described below.",
