  "text": "In beet western yellow virus, pea enation mosaic virus, and other luteoviruses, an RNA pseudoknot also stimulates a −1 frameshift between the P1 and P2 genes [29] . These structures, solved by X-ray crystallography and NMR, respectively, revealed compact H-type pseudoknots with extensive loop-stem interactions ( Figure 2E) [7, 9] . Like that of MMTV, frameshiftinducing pseudoknots in both the beet western yellow virus and pea enation mosaic virus have an unpaired nucleotide at the junction of the stems; however, this nucleotide is displaced from the helix, not intercalated as in MMTV.",
