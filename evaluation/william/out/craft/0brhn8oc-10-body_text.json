  "text": "The frameshift-inducing pseudoknot from simian retrovirus 1 contains a number of unique features ( Figure 2F ) [8] . Although predicted to resemble that of MMTV, with an unpaired adenine between the helices, the structure revealed the formation of a uracil-adenine pair at the junction, allowing the two stems to stack directly on top of each other ( Figure 2F ) [8] . The simian retrovirus 1 pseudoknot forms an extensive loop 2-stem 1 triplex, which contains a ribose zipper motif in addition to base-base and base-sugar interactions [8] .",
