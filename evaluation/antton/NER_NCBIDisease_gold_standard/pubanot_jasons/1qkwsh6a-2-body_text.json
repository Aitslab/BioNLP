The scientific interest on coronaviruses increased after the emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus ( SARS - CoV ) outbreaks in 2002 - 2003 followed by Middle East Respiratory Syndrome CoV ( MERS - CoV ) . This decade ' s first CoV , named 2019 - nCoV , emerged from Wuhan , China , and declared as ' Public Health Emergency of International Concern ' on January 30th , 2020 by the World Health Organization ( WHO ) . As on February 4 , 2020 , 425 deaths reported in China only and one death outside China ( Philippines ) . In a short span of time , the virus spread has been noted in 24 countries . The zoonotic transmission ( animal - to - human ) is suspected as the route of disease origin . The genetic analyses predict bats as the most probable source of 2019 - nCoV though further investigations needed to confirm the origin of the novel virus . The ongoing nCoV outbreak highlights the hidden wild animal reservoir of the deadly viruses and possible threat of spillover zoonoses as well . The successful virus isolation attempts have made doors open for developing better diagnostics and effective vaccines helping in combating the spread of the virus to newer areas .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 51, "end": 97}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 241, "end": 287}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 289, "end": 300}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 339, "end": 376}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 5, "span": {"begin": 378, "end": 389}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 6, "span": {"begin": 1052, "end": 1057}, "obj": "ne"}]}
