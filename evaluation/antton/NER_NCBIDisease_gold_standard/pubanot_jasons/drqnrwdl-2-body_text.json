We present estimates of the basic reproduction number , R0 , of 2019 - nCoV in the early phase of the outbreak . METHODS : Accounting for the impact of the variations in disease reporting rate , we modelled the epidemic curve of 2019 - nCoV cases time series , in mainland China from January 10 to January 24 , 2020 , through the exponential growth . With the estimated intrinsic growth rate ( \u03b3 ) , we estimated R0 by using the serial intervals ( SI ) of two other well - known coronavirus diseases , MERS and SARS , as approximations for the true unknown SI . FINDINGS : The early outbreak data largely follows the exponential growth . We estimated that the mean R0 ranges from 2 . 24 ( 95 % CI : 1 . 96 - 2 . 55 ) to 3 . 58 ( 95 % CI : 2 . 89 - 4 . 39 ) associated with 8 - fold to 2 - fold increase in the reporting rate . We demonstrated that changes in reporting rate substantially affect estimates of R0 . CONCLUSION : The mean estimate of R0 for the 2019 - nCoV ranges from 2 . 24 to 3 . 58 , and is significantly larger than 1 . Our findings indicate the potential of 2019 - nCoV to cause outbreaks .", "project": "cdlai_CORD-19", "denotations": [{"id": 1, "span": {"begin": 45, "end": 83}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 2, "span": {"begin": 694, "end": 715}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 3, "span": {"begin": 717, "end": 722}, "obj": "ne"}, {"id": 4, "span": {"begin": 726, "end": 731}, "obj": "ne"}]}
